Hi Patrick

one problem  see with this is as follows

The RP typically gives a binary blob to the PKI and asks it to validate 
the signature on the binary blob. The PKI has no knowledge about the 
semantic content of this blob. So it cannot tell the difference between 
a SAML assertion, OpenID assertion, Oauth assertion, Word document, or a 
love letter.

I dont think we should be building this sort of semantics into signature 
verification.

regards

David

Hi David,

I'm not at all sure what you are talking about - I've never seen a world =
where an RP gives anything to the PKI to verify - it usually (when it is =
well behaved) extracts the certificate (after making sure that the =
public key in the cert is the same that was used to sign the message) =
and does RFC5280 Section 6 validation on it, or at least makes sure this =
Certificate chains to a Trust Anchor that it has pre-configured. This is =
all done on the RP itself. The RP knows the semantics of the message =
that it has, and presumably (in the case of SAML) knows who the =
authorised IDPs are (which may include, in this case, checking to see if =
the claimSigning EKU is present).

I'm not asking for, or saying anything about signature semantics - =
Stefan and Sean wanted a definition of a claim to be used when asserting =
the "claimSigning" EKU, and I gave it to them.

Cheers,

Patrick.

Martin,

Please read 
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/pkix/current/msg27687.html for an 
example of the confusion that the text in RFC 2560 is causing.  This is 
not about making changes to the protocol and then trying to achieve 
greater adoption of those changes, it is about making the document 
sufficiently clear and unambiguous that problems like the one described 
in that message can be avoided in the future.

In this message, you are again asking for changes to be made.  For 
example you said:
> What seems to be badly lacking in Appendix E of -04 is the requirements
> of which certs MUST be included in the OCSP response for each of the
> example CA/OCSP architecture/hierarchy, except for Figure 1 (where
> no cert is necessary).

I was given a very strict mandate to not make any changes to OCSP.  Can 
you show me where this "MUST" requirement appears in RFC 2560?  If not, 
then how could I include such a "MUST" requirement in 2560bis without 
breaking my promise not to make any changes to the protocol.  This 
proposed change may be a good idea, but that doesn't mean it's not a change.

You also say that "There really ought to be a requirement that 
implementations (of CA and OCSP software) MUST support short-lived OCSP 
signer certs...."  Again, that may be a good idea, but can you find that 
requirement in RFC 2560?  If not, then wouldn't including such a 
requirement in 2560bis be a change?

The final paragraph in your message proposes reordering the checks in 
Section 2.3.6.  However, the checks in Section 2.3.6 are listed in the 
same order as they appear in Section 3.2 of RFC 2560. While one could 
certainly reorder them without changing the protocol since the text does 
not specify that the checks need to be performed in the order they are 
listed, it would seem that reordering them would be inconsistent with 
the approach that you are advocating of "doing minimal changes to the 
original document."

You also misrepresent RFC 5280 in your message.  RFC 5280 very clearly 
allows CAs to sign CRLs with a different key than was used to sign the 
certificates covered by the CRL, and notes that it may be necessary for 
a relying party to build a separate certification path for the 
certificate needed to verify the signature on the CRL.  As for OCSP, 
contrary to your assertion, relying parties are *NOT* required to be 
able to validate responses if the response (or the responder's 
certificate) was signed with a different key than the target 
certificate.  I cannot find a single statement in RFC 2560 that states 
that conforming applications MUST be able to validate such responses, 
and so there is no such statement in 2560bis either.

Hi Patrick

I am talking from the perspective of the RP which, in the case of SAML,
would be the SAML SP, which has received a SAML assertion which it needs 
to verify.

In my opinion this is part of the PKI validation, not the PMI validation 
(section 6 is entitled certification path validation). The PKI roots of 
trust are configured into the PKI, not the PMI. The PMI would only have 
one or more PKI roots of trust configured into it, if it did not know 
who its trusted IDPs were, and was relying on the PKI to tell it.

This is all done on the RP itself.

the RP is the SAML IDP in the case of SAML assertions. It is relying on 
the PKI to validate the signatures on the signed messages (SAML 
assertions) that it receives.

  The RP knows the

If the RP already knows who the trusted IDPs are, then there is no point 
in having the EKU field. All that is important is that the assertion is 
signed by the IDP, regardless of which key or certificate it used. The 
SAML SP should be insulated from the IDP migrating between keys and 
certificates - let the PKI component take care of this. I know that 
today's implementations pass around certificates in meta-data, but I 
regard this is as deficiency in trust validation.

regards

David

Hi,

The contentHint in CMS can be used for processing type identification
of signed binary blob

Attribute SEQUENCE {
  attrType OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.4 id-aa-contentHint
  attrValues SET {
   ContentHints SEQUENCE {
    contentDescription UTF8String =E2=80=98MIME-Version: 1.0
      Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3DUTF-8; name=3D"Document.txt"
      Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=3D"Document.txt"=E2=80=98
    contentType OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1.7.1 id-data
   }
  }
}

Interoperability profile...

Vote:  I change my vote to option A.

Notice:  I assume I'm writing to just the three of you since I still
can't get a fix on why my posts to PKIX bounce.  I am at this very
moment working with my ISP on the issue. But to the extent you are
consolidating WG positions for a consensus on a path forward, there's
mine.

Essay:  The key that signs the response need not be the key that
signed the cert.  That capability MUST be maintained to enable an
effective distribution of authority.  I know well the original
language is at times ambiguous, the reasons for which have likely been
overcome by events.

David,

I am somewhat baffled by your comment. There is a long precedence for refin=
ing the sign semantics of the key used extension via the eku extension to e=
xpress sign what. We have signed code, signed documents, signed revocation =
responses eku purposes. The whole purpose of the EKU extension was to enabl=
e this kind of expression. The RP absolutely understands if it is processin=
g claims so can filter based on EKU.
We should not be inventing new semantics for different kinds of signing.

Hi Patrick

I am talking from the perspective of the RP which, in the case of SAML, wou=
ld be the SAML SP, which has received a SAML assertion which it needs to ve=
rify.

In my opinion this is part of the PKI validation, not the PMI validation (s=
ection 6 is entitled certification path validation). The PKI roots of trust=
 are configured into the PKI, not the PMI. The PMI would only have one or m=
ore PKI roots of trust configured into it, if it did not know who its trust=
ed IDPs were, and was relying on the PKI to tell it.

This is all done on the RP itself.

the RP is the SAML IDP in the case of SAML assertions. It is relying on the=
 PKI to validate the signatures on the signed messages (SAML
assertions) that it receives.

  The RP knows the

If the RP already knows who the trusted IDPs are, then there is no point in=
 having the EKU field. All that is important is that the assertion is signe=
d by the IDP, regardless of which key or certificate it used. The SAML SP s=
hould be insulated from the IDP migrating between keys and certificates - l=
et the PKI component take care of this. I know that today's implementations=
 pass around certificates in meta-data, but I regard this is as deficiency =
in trust validation.

David

OT:

a throroughly confusing example in Appendix E.3
Locally Trusted OCSP Responder at the end of -04 document:

  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis-04#page-42

which uses a self-signed certificate of a non-CA entity.

This is outside of PKIX/rfc5280 and an option not listed under 2.3.5.2:

  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis-04#section-2.3.5.2

and looks to _me_ like a bad idea in general.

Hi Trevor

there is one big difference in all these cases your mention and that of
a PMI claim which I mention, namely, the RPs are either all applications 
(signed code, signed documents) or PKI components (revocation) that are 
using the PKI to validate its signed documents. Thus the PKI is the 
*only* security component the RP is relying on, whilst in the case of 
validating a PMI claim, the PMI is actually part of the security 
infrastructure itself (on a par with the PKI). Thus the PMI does not 
need to rely on the PKI to the same extent as the other components. It 
is fully capable of validating its own trust chains. The PMI forms a 
parallel infrastructure to the PKI.

regards

David

Hello David,

I think that your assumption only works in the case where the PMI =
operates their own CA (that signs only Metadata and/or IDP =
certificates).=20

In a couple of cases that I am aware of, the same CA that issues =
Identity Certificates, general Purpose Device Certificates, there is a =
desire issue IDP Certs, and distinguish these from general purpose =
Device certificates.=20

Furthermore, IDPs may be part of a dynamic Federation (it is sufficient =
to be part of the same PKI Community - we're treating Attribute =
Assurance separately), and therefore there IS no metadata. Consequently, =
the PMI and the PKI may be part of the same Trust Infrastructure, and =
therefore are not considered independent.

There are many models for Federation that are emerging, and we need to =
have a way to support these.

Cheers,

Patrick.

Thus the PKI is the *only* security component the RP is relying on, =
whilst in the case of validating a PMI claim, the PMI is actually part =
of the security infrastructure itself (on a par with the PKI). Thus the =
PMI does not need to rely on the PKI to the same extent as the other =

I haven't fully read through this, but it appears to be quite related
to my complaint about Appendix E of the -04 document to be lacking
requirements on inclusion of which particular certs in the OCSP response
in order to provide a basis for interop.  Without such requirements
about which certs must be present in the OCSP response, interop will
remain a lucky coincidence rather than a result of conscious design
decisions.

And as an implementor, I would limit my OCSP to exactly two cases:
(1) certificate signer key also signed the OCSP response
(2) certificate signer key also signed an OCSP responder cert,
    and this OCSP responder cert MUST be included in the OCSP response.

First, the rest of my reply was under the stated premise:

=
= This sounds like you're asking for _changing_ the existing protocol
= by publishing a new spec with different or additional requirements.


and secondly, I'm against requiring OCSP clients to support fancy PKI
models.  However the complete lack of details what needs to be included
in an OCSP response in order to provide a basis for interop is a
DEFECT of rfc2560. 

I would be perfectly OK with augmenting the existing spec with
something like

"In order to provide reliable interoperability on
this protocol options, the following additional requirements are
necessary, that are not part of rfc2560 (but might have been
obvious implications for some implementors anyhow".

If you approach rfc2560 from the viewpoint of formal correctness proofing,
you will immediately notice which protocol options are underspecified
and where you will encounter interop problems with implementers who
do not read a spec and create an implementation with any kind of formal
correctness in mind (i.e. planned and predictable behaviour
in unknown future usage scenarios).

Same as above.

rfcdiff visualizes this as newly added text:

http://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=rfc2560.txt&url2=draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis-04.txt

...which is one of the reasons that I'm violently opposed to
completely rearrange the document structure in the fasion of -04


Concerning the same info in section of rfc2560 section 3.2
a clarifying text that the ordering in the enumeration is not normative,
and it might be sensible to perform the public key signature verification
at the end, rather than as 2nd check, because it is likely the most
"expensive" operation and one should avoid making public key crypto
operations with public keys before it has been established that these
keys are trustworthy.

Quoting from rfc5280, section 5.1.1.3

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5.1.1.3

                     The use of separate CA certificates for validation
   of certificate signatures and CRL signatures can offer improved
   security characteristics; however, it imposes a burden on
   applications, and it might limit interoperability.  Many applications
   construct a certification path, and then validate the certification
   path (Section 6).  CRL checking in turn requires a separate
   certification path to be constructed and validated for the CA's CRL
*> signature validation certificate.  Applications that perform CRL
*> checking MUST support certification path validation when certificates
*> and CRLs are digitally signed with the same CA private key.  These
   applications SHOULD support certification path validation when
   certificates and CRLs are digitally signed with different CA private
   keys.


rfc5280 is pretty explicit that support for CRLs that are not signed
by the same CA key that signed the certificate is OPTIONAL, because
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT RPs will likely not support it.

Keep in mind that CRLs, in contrast to OCSP, lack a standardized
carry-on container for CRL signer certificates.


Keep also in mind, that construction(!) of a certificate path is
explicitly outside of the scope of rfc5280.  Which more-or-less
means that all options described in rfc5280 that require certificate
path construction are implicitly outside the scope of rfc5280 as well
(and very likely missing in minimum requirement RPs):

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-73

   The primary goal of path validation is to verify the binding between
   a subject distinguished name or a subject alternative name and
   subject public key, as represented in the target certificate, based
   on the public key of the trust anchor.  In most cases, the target
   certificate will be an end entity certificate, but the target
   certificate may be a CA certificate as long as the subject public key
   is to be used for a purpose other than verifying the signature on a
   public key certificate.  Verifying the binding between the name and
   subject public key requires obtaining a sequence of certificates that
*> support that binding.  The procedure performed to obtain this
*> sequence of certificates is outside the scope of this specification.

That is a misunderstanding.  I'm perfectly aware and OK with this.

What is lacking in RFC2560, and should be added in rfc2560bis is
that when using a different OCSP signer cert, then the OCSP server
MUST include all certs that will be necessary for processing this
OCSP response *within* the OCSP response.

In general, this also means that the examples in
Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 of -04 are incorrect, because
in general a cross-cert between the cert-signing CA cert and the
OCSP-responder signing CA cert will be necessary, unless the
OCSP request contains an unambiguous proof that the OCSP client
is in posession of the rootCA cert from Figures 7, 8, 9

I'm sorry for the confusion.

The text works for me (the leading text about BasicConstraints was
confusing, but is not longer part of your proposal).

I intended to indicate with "OT:" ("off-topic") that this comment
was not about the proposed text itself (topic of this discussion thread)
but related to it.


Primarily I wanted to point out that the example usage scenario
for a local OCSP responder, that is depicted in Appendix E.3 of the
rfc2560bis-04 document, a self-signed cert that is issued by a
non-CA is used.

To me it looks very odd that the only usage scenario described
for a local OCSP responder is implicitly out-of-scope for rfc5280
and will be explicitly out-of-scope for rfc5280bis.

Hi David,

The message I hear loud and clear from organization is their pain due to es=
calating management cost because so many technologies are management stove =
pipes. So while most of us are trying to find ways to make management share=
d across applications,  hear you are suggesting this is a good thing.
If it looks like a pkix certificate, smells like a pkix certificate it shou=
ld be managed like a pkix certificate.=20

Hi Trevor

there is one big difference in all these cases your mention and that of a P=
MI claim which I mention, namely, the RPs are either all applications (sign=
ed code, signed documents) or PKI components (revocation) that are using th=
e PKI to validate its signed documents. Thus the PKI is the
*only* security component the RP is relying on, whilst in the case of valid=
ating a PMI claim, the PMI is actually part of the security infrastructure =
itself (on a par with the PKI). Thus the PMI does not need to rely on the P=
KI to the same extent as the other components. It is fully capable of valid=
ating its own trust chains. The PMI forms a parallel infrastructure to the =
PKI.

regards

David

As it was just mentioned in the meeting.

RFC 5280 is referencing X.509 2005/08 rather than X.509 2008/11,
so the comment about self-signed non-CA certs is:


X.509 2005/08    3.3.56  self-signed certificate

X.509 2008/11    3.4.61  self-signed certificate


I'm sorry for the confusion.

Absolutely not. PMIs should always be designed to work with general 
purpose PKIs and software (e.g. we use bouncy castle in our PMI).

"there is a desire" by whom? The CA operator? The federation operator? 
The RP/SP? The PMI?

Fine, I like that model much better. Metadata harks back to pre-DNS days 
when sites used to be email the name-address mappings nightly. You would 
have thought that federations would have learnt from that experience 
that using metadata does not scale well. (The UK Access Federation has 
belatedly found this out).

They are always independent. Just as authn is separate from authz, trust 
in who issues claims is independent from who issues PKCs. Mixing them 
together is a big mistake. (this does not mean that the same entity 
cannot be trusted to do both, but logically they are separate roles)

David

General Purpose PKIs !=3D PKI Products - I mean a PKI (regardless of =

The products used to issue these Certificates should no have bearing on =

they both work, the result is useless. As Trevor said - the stovepiping =

problems with comprehension in the folks that want to deploy this.

The companies that have invested heavily in PKI. They are the CA =

PMI is a community agreed Arbiter of Federation Trust, of which the =

Well, no - there is no reason why a PMI and a PKI Bridge operator have =
to be separate - they provide the same function - arbitrating Trust =
between organisations - the only difference is a semantic one that a PMA =
(A PKI is simply the entirety of stuff that carries out the will of a =
PMA) deals in Identity Trust, and a PMI deals in Attribute Trust.

The semantics of the responderID field is something that may be useful
to clarify in an RFC 2560 document.  I brought this up earlier, but it
may have been forgotten in the flurry of other issues:

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/pkix/current/msg29802.html
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/pkix/current/msg29803.html

One good reason for not clarifying this would be if the intention is
fussy or people are implementing different approaches.  Does anyone know
if that is the case?

A few comments on the presentation about the URN Namespace for Certificates
from the IETF 84 PKIX WG session.

There are existing standards for identifying certificates in textual form,
and that is XMLdsig and standards derived from it (WS-Security from OASIS),

>From the top of my head, the following references are defined:

  (a)  Subject Name (of the certificate)
  (b)  Issuer & Serial
  (c)  SubjectKeyIdentifier
  (d)  the cert itself (base64-encoded)


I see a problem with the proposal of using a certificate hash in case
there are situation when the certificate itself is _not_ conveyed along
with the message.

There are usage scenarios where instead of using a PKI, the consumer
may decided to configure direct trust to the peer certificate.
In order to do that, the consumer might have to import the certificate
as "trust anchor", and potentially it is persisted in one of the
formats defined for trust anchors in rfc5914

>From the three trust anchor formats defined in rfc5914, one is only the
ToBeSigned part of a certificate, so a certificate hash is useless to
find/identify that trust anchor, and for the trust anchor format
"TrustAnchorInfo", storing the certificate is purely optional,
so again, matching of a certificate hash may simply impossible.


With respect to existing standards for referencing certificate
in textual formats, look here:



The WSS-X509TokenProfile-20040315.pdf document lists the
following token references in Section 3.2:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-x509-token-profile-1.0.pdf

  3.2 Token References

  In order to ensure a consistent processing model across all the
  token types supported by WSS:SOAP Message Security,
  the <wsse:SecurityTokenReference> element SHALL be used to specify all
  references to X.509 token types in signature or encryption elements
  that comply with this profile.

  A <wsse:SecurityTokenReference> element MAY reference an X.509 token
  type by one of the following means:

    Reference to a Subject Key Identifier
       The <wsse:SecurityTokenReference> element contains
       a <wsse:KeyIdentifier> element that specifies the token data
       by means of a X.509 SubjectKeyIdentifier reference.

    Reference to a Binary Security Token
       The <wsse:SecurityTokenReference> element contains a <wsse:Reference>
       element that references a local <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element
       or a remote data source that contains the token data itself.

    Reference to an Issuer and Serial Number
       The <wsse:SecurityTokenReference> element contains a <ds:X509Data>
       element that contains a <ds:X509IssuerSerial> element that uniquely
       identifies an end entity certificate by its X.509 Issuer and
       Serial Number.


The basic XMLdsig spec is less specific here:
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#sec-KeyInfo

http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#dname-encrules

   4.4.4.1 Distinguished Name Encoding Rules

     [...]

   Schema Definition

   <element name="X509Data" type="ds:X509DataType"/> 
   <complexType name="X509DataType">
     <sequence maxOccurs="unbounded">
       <choice>
         <element name="X509IssuerSerial" type="ds:X509IssuerSerialType"/>
         <element name="X509SKI" type="base64Binary"/>

Comments based on the PKIX @ IETF-84 presentation.

I typically refer to the textual format as
"PEM-framed, base64-encoded Format", because of the PEM boundary markers.

The code I have written myself will choke on any Mime-Headers inserted
after the -----BEGIN boundary marker -- except for the support of the
OpenSSL PKCS5 encrypted private key, where these headers are AFAIK necessary
for processing/decoding the content.

A while ago I did add support for conveying CRLs out-of-band (file-based),
but realized that for really making an offline CRL check feasible,
it would be reasonable to convey a "bag-of-CRLs" packaged in a single
file, rather than individual CRLs, and chose PKCS#7 SIGNED_DATA with
no data as the container.  Individual, plain CRLs are also supported
an treated as a bag-of-CRL containing exactly one CRL.

The request seems to be motivated by a bureaucratic cover-your-ass
policy approach of some CAs or "policy authorities", rather than from
a genuine need to change the security properties of SAML.

It is close to impossible to change the security properties of
a long deployed installed base of a technology such as SAML
just by throwing an EKU definition after them.

The necessary sequence of events is probably:

  1. an EKU needs to be selected or assigned
     (since this is a plain ASN.1 OID, *ANY* OID will do,
      asking PKIX for an OID is just adding pain...)

  2. add the EKU and the desired semantics to a revision or
     new version of the SAML spec (or whatever).

  3. wait for implementations to adopt the new features

  4. wait for updated implementations to get deployed

  5. decide when to start "enforcing" that EKUs are present on
     the certs that signed claims.

What could be done in order to minimize the changes to the original
protocol is adding one or more appendixes that specify "interop profiles",
showing which additional requirements will result in what kind of
interop improvements.  Any new/additional requirement may imply
a patch/change/update of at least parts of the installed base, of course.


The focus should be, what minimum set of additional/new requirements
will provide reliable interop on which exact protocol option.

And new requirements(=changes) for the OCSP responder or the PKI/CA will
often be easier to deploy than changes to the unwashed masses of
OCSP clients (RPs).  That does not necessarily mean that it will be
easier to get a software for the OCSP server or CA than for the
OCSP client from the respecitive software suppliers...

That is sort-of a prerequisite for making OCSP processing work reliably.

Think of the new TLS extension for stapling OCSP responses.  The objective
is that a client can connect to a server, obtain the server certificate
along with **ALL** OCSP responses necessary to verify the server certificate
from the TLS handshake and not having to do _any_ third party communication
at all.  The algorithm for the server to obtain the necessary OCSP responses
allowing this should be simple and straight-forward.  If verification
of OCSP signer certs would need additional OCSP responsed or CRLs, then
it would no longer be simple and straightforward.

use the existing standard SOAidentifier extension and the OID defined 
for this. Note that this extension is NOT critical, which is what you 
need in order for the migration to succeed successfully. Using a 
critical extension will screw up any chance of migration or interworking.

add this to profile of SAML

You dont need to enforce it ever, since the rules for non-critical 
extension processing mean that once an implementation understands the 
extension is must follow it. So enforcement becomes automatic once the 
certificate processing code is updated.

This might be somewhat optimistic (IMHO unrealistic) about the
meaning of criticality of a certificate extension that by itself
is fairly meaningless to the PKIX certificate path validation function.

An application that doesn't care about EKU will often ... simply
not care about EKU.

This addition would also have to specify whether
"anyKeyPurpose" is OK.

"Enforcing" means that the "app" (SAML) would have to check whether
the certificate contained an EKU cert extension, and when it did,
check whether the EKU extension contained the specific KeyPurpose(O)ID in
question, and abort with an error if EKU was present, but the
specific SAML KeyPurpose(O)ID was missing (or anyKeyPurpose is present
and acceptable).

Hi Patrick

It seems that we do not share a common viewpoint. I say that PKI and PMI 
are separate functions and that an AA and CA are separate roles, but the 
same entity can act in both roles. However you said they provide the 
same function. I should like you to justify this, and perhaps you can 
use as an example a university AA which issues degree attributes and a 
CA which issues PKCs.

regards

David

Martin,

I don't know why you find the example "thoroughly confusing" or "a bad 
idea in general," but if you think this is such a bad example, what 
would you propose as a good example of a locally trusted OCSP responder?

Martin,

As you voted for option A in the straw poll, please provide Stefan with 
this formal correctness proof so that he can address any aspects of the 
protocol that are underspecified, in case future development of 2560bis 
is based on option A.

Dave

G'day Folks,

yesterday at PKIX we had some folks supporting the proposed OCSP over 
DNS protocol (see: 
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pala-rea-ocsp-over-dns/) and some 
folks who said they did not like the idea. Time was short and I failed 
to get further feedback from the folks who "hated" (yes that was the 
exact phrase that was used) the idea as to WHY they do not support the 
idea.
Would those folks be willing to post their objections/justifications to 
the list, and if are not quite ready to make a public declaration, 
please send Max or I an email directly off-list as to reasons why you 
would not support this proposal?

Scott Rea <Scott@DigiCert.com> or
Massimiliano Pala <pala@isis.poly.edu>

Regards,

-- 
Scott Rea

Below is the text that was briefed in the PKIX meeting yesterday and 
that represents
the current, proposed text for addition to Section 3.2. Russ noted that 
we need to
add a reference to the 2008 version of X.509 from which we have cited 
text.  Peter will
reissue the doc with this change. I plan to forward that version to the 
IESG a week after
it is posted, unless we hear otherwise.

Add the following paragraph to the end of RFC 5280, Section 3.2:

Consistent with Section 3.4.61 of X.509 (11/2008) we note that use of 
self-issued certificates and self-signed certificates issued by other 
than CAs are outside the scope of this specification. Thus, for example, 
a web server or client might generate a self-signed certificate to 
identify itself. These certificates, and how a relying party uses them 
to authenticate asserted identities, are both outside the scope of RFC 5280.

Tim,

You say that "Our experience with implementations of RFC 2560 has been
decidedly mixed"

I have in the past years developed tools for signature validation within
the EU trust framework.
This involves 800+ trust services, many of them providing OCSP.
My experience with interoperating with a vast amount of OCSP responders in
EU is that the practically only technical issue I ever have encountered,
is related to certificate chaining to the OCSP responder. Except from that
I have encountered some OCSP responders (very few though) that don't think
I'm authorized to ask for some reason, but that is not a technical interop
failure.

So in my experience, RFC 2560 does in large work very well in creating
interoperability, except for the chaining issue.

If your experience is different from mine, it would be really helpful to
get a list of recorded interop issues. Even a rough list would be helpful.
It would certainly help knowing what needs fixing and to determine if a
complete re-write is motivated.

/Stefan

=> I attended another session so I didn't follow the presentation itself
but according to the slides in the meeting materials I am afraid I deeply
dislike the idea (i.e., haters++). BTW the DNS is in no way a "transport".

Thanks Francis!

could you elaborate on WHY you do not like this proposal? We do not have 
any concrete data on what is at the source of haters' objections. There 
was a comment in the meeting about further burdening DNS, which we 
accept as a concrete reason for objection, but other than that, we seem 
to just have ephemeral statements of preferences rather than concrete 
reasoning behind the preferences - are you willing to lay out you base 
reasons for rejection?

Regards,
_Scott

No. As I noted before, 5280 discusses cert signing (aka generation) and 
cert processing
by an RP. The text above addresses these separately, and appropriately.

Hello Francis,

Thanks for the comments - as Scott wrote, it would be interesting if you could
let us know what is, specifically, that you do not like and how this could be
a problem for PKIs (why it should not be standardized).

Our attempt is to provide another mechanism that CAs can use (if they want to)
to distribute pre-computed OCSP responses - cheap, easy to deploy, and that
would deliver (by using the DNS caching) the response close to the client (thus,
enhancing their availability).

Issue:
- We need to improve the availability of OCSP responses. Today, the quality of service
   across different CAs is not enough for applications to enable strict revocation
   checking (issues: costs and connectivity issues (eg., latency))

The starting points for our proposal are:
- We should try to provide an infrastructure for OCSP checking (rev info checking)
   that minimize unavailability of data because of network issues
- Pre-computed OCSP responses can be provided via different access methods
   (e.g., HTTP, CDNs, FTP, etc.)
- For high-volume websites, huge bandwidth is required on the OCSP side to provide
   services that meet the expectations (and high costs) of clients
- Availability of OCSP responses could be increased by using widely deployed and
   distributed services like DNS / DNSSEC

Given the problem, the well-defined boundaries, and the considerations on the need
to address the availability of revocation information, we think that this I-D could
provide a well-targeted mid-term solution to the issue.

Any input on the matter that takes in consideration the above points, is more than
welcome as the purpose here is to address a real issue that affects practically all
the Internet users.

Best,
Max

Simon,

I fully agree,
The spec ought to say something about the expected information if the Name
choice is chosen.

The ASN.1 structure is defined, but some wording about content would be
suitable.

I can't see however that anything but the subject name of the OCSP
responder (identical to the responder certificate) would go here.

/Stefan

FYI, as I mentioned in the SAAG session this afternoon and have mentioned on 
these lists before, the CA/Browser Forum (CABF) is entertaining governance 
reforms.

The CABF has decided on four governance proposals on which the members are 
voting. These proposals are listed on the CABF home page here..

   CA/Browser Forum (CABF): Governance Proposals
   Published, Advancing Toward Adoption
   http://cabforum.org/

As noted there, the CABF is soliciting public input (but not votes), and as

Dear colleagues,

I apologise I had to leave the PKIX meeting yesterday after the CAA
discussion; I was double booked.  Also, for that reason I wasn't
really prepared for PKIX (indeed, it was only due to a fortunate IM
that I knew I needed to pay attention.  Thanks to Richard!)

So, I hadn't read draft-pala-rea-ocsp-over-dns prior to today.  I just
did, although very quickly.

My natural reaction when someone says, "%$#* that, just put it in the
DNS," [http://twitpic.com/9au7p5] is to break out in hives, so I get
why people "hate" this proposal.  That said, it is not the dumbest
idea I've heard.  It's not even the dumbest idea I've heard this week.
If I understand it correctly, all the data ends up in a DNS zone
operated by the CA, and the goal is mainly to produce a mechanism that
is low latency and can take advantage of distributed caches.  If
that's right, then it seems to me like a possibly viable notion.

The draft as it stands needs an enormous amount of work, I should
note.  I have some reservations about the DNS URL arrangement, at
least to the extent I understand it (which isn't very far).  As it
stands, the draft doesn't say at all how to look these records up, nor
what RRTYPE they use (I suspect a new one is needed, and we'll need to
specify it).

Those issues are all just issues about the details in the document,
however, and could be fixed.  Also, it seems to me that this approach
could help with a significant problem that CAs have.

There are some environments, of course, in which this approach won't
work.  I'm nervous about the speed at which a new RRTYPE could be
deployed, and that might be a dealbreaker.  Also, sometimes
applications just can't get unmolested access to DNS, and that might
be another problem that means this won't really help.  But perhaps
these things could be mitigated, and some additional iterations will
probably clarify some of it.

I am willing to help with the document if the authors want to pursue
it.  

Best regards,

A

For those who were not at the WG meeting, to reiterate a point that was 
mentioned:

There is concern that "just putting it in the DNS" will overload DNS 
operators. This should be addressed through empirical data, the 
conclusions based on which ought to be mentioned in the RFC.

[Note: it shouldn't overload DNS operators--if they are all under the 
CA's domain, then it only "overloads" the CA operator, but this should 
be cheaper than running a true OCSP server. However, it may place more 
overhead on intervening DNS caching servers, as distinct from DNS 
operators that have the authoritative records.]

To iterate a point of my own volition (with a nod to my co-author 
colleague):

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4501
S. Josefsson, Domain Name System Uniform Resource Identifiers

Whatever is in ocsp-over-dns must follow RFC 4501, which specifies:
  dns://192.168.1.1/some.ocsp.ca.service.com?type=SOMETYPE

If you have a problem with the format of DNS URIs, it's about six years 
too late...but at least RFC 4501 provides a comprehensive treatment of that.

Thanks.  How about adding something like this to section 4.2.2.3?

  The purpose of the ResponderID information is to allow clients to find
  the certificate used to sign a signed OCSP response.  Therefor, the
  information MUST correspond to the certificate that was used to sign
  the response.

It should probably go early in the section, just after the first
bullet-point list.

I am not confident that this is non-controverisal, as I'm not an OCSP
expert.  I would appreciate if more people considered whether this text
makes sense or not.  I am hoping that the paragraph is trivial to
everyone experienced with OCSP.

When I wrote the OCSP support for GnuTLS I found this area to be
under-specified.  If there is any deployment out there which puts
something other than the OCSP responder signer cert identity in the
ResponderID field, I would have expected guidance from the document on
what purpose the field serves.

The introduction section also needs to be updated to describe this
change.  I would propose adding something like:

 o Section 4.2.2.3 clarify that the ResponderID field corresponds to the
   OCSP Responder signer certificate.

Btw, I noticed a typo in the document:

OLD:
      o  Section 4.1.1 specifies the ASN.1 syntax for the nonce
NEW:
      o  Section 4.4.1 specifies the ASN.1 syntax for the nonce

If the XML is available in a respository somewhere, I could send you a
patch. :-)

Cheers,
/Simon

All,

For the RFC2560 update, I reviewed the text copied from RFC 6277 and
noticed that it is silent on whether the client extension should or
could be marked as critical or not.

Is there some guidance on what a client should specify?  Is this
something that an implementer can chose, or should this be something an
administrator or user should be able to specify?

I'm guessing that in most situations you would want the extension
non-critical, but I wouldn't rule out situations where the client would
want to require the OCSP responder to support this extension.  Does that
reflect what others believe?

And finally, does any of these considerations belong in 2560bis?

the fact that nothing permitted to specify parameters along with the hash
function, and I'm seeing GOST-hashed OCSP requests in our responders since
mid july]

Bonjour,

I'm not sure that DNSSEC is useful here. After all, OCSP is usually
requested and sent in clear, the response is already signed. I don't know
what could DNSSEC add in here that we're missing.

GOST (and not Ghost) R 34.11-94 is a hash algorithm based on the GOST
28147-89 block cipher. The former needs an initial value, the latter needs
some S-Boxes. CryptoPro defined 2 sets of parameters (test and production)
in RFC4357, and a NULL parameter designates the "production" parameters (if
I correctly read the ASN.1 module, I'm not sure it's valid). There's no
"DEFAULT" in the DigestAlgorithm definition, the parameters element is only
declared "OPTIONAL", so no value is not a synonym of a NULL value.

I don't see how this could overload a DNS operator.  But anyway,
that's a rather unconvincing argument, for taken to its logical
conclusion it would preclude putting anything more in the DNS.  Given
that the proposal puts everything into a single zone (well, one or
more zones per CA, but anyway it uses the normal top-down DNS lookup
model), I simply don't see any objection on operational grounds,
unless the responses are very large (that would have implications for
caches).

Yeah, that was more or less what I was expecting, and the draft
doesn't look to my bleary eyes like it's following that.  It also
doesn't refer to RFC 4501, so I think that might be the first problem.

I'm more concerned about the RRTYPE and responses, though, for the
reasons above.  Fixing up the way the URI is presented would be
irrelevant if we learn that every response is going to be 400k.  I'm
pretty sure that's not the case, but I can't tell from the draft.

Best,

A

I don't fully understand the way the mechanism is supposed to work,
and I don't really know very much about OCSP, so I'm speaking from
almost total ignorance.  But DNSSEC will provide you with assurances
that the answer you get is in fact unmolested along the path.  This
could be important for ensuring you don't get fake answers.  For
instance, without DNSSEC, an attacker could insert an Name Error
response and thereby leave the client needing to fall back to some
other mechanism.  In the presence of DNSSEC, that attack would be
detected.  (You'd still be unable to use the mechanism, so I can see
an argument that there's no real gain here.)

>From the draft, however, I have no idea how the response is signed
when it comes through the DNS.  Am I just overlooking something in the
draft?  Since there's no RRTYPE definition, it's kinda hard to know
what the fields in the response will contain.

Best,

A

This is already guaranteed with OCSP, which are signed objects.

That's the point. DNSSEC offers nothing more.

Today's mechanism:
 - attacker exchanges the response with a one unrelated to the request: RP
can detect it
 - attacker exchanges the response with a previous one: RP can detect if
the response has expired, responses usually have a max 10 days validity
period, some CAs have 4 hours validity responses
 - attacker exchanges the response with an unsigned error message: RP can
detect it
 - attacker blocks the response: RP can detect it

When the RP detects something wrong, it either falls back to another
validation mechanism (other OCSP URL, or CRL) or declares the certificate
as not trusted.

With the proposed mechanism (DNS), DNSSEC could have some value on the

What I understand is that the returned object is the requested OCSP token,
not a different beast.

=> not formally 100% true: DNSSEC offers secured proof of not existence.
Now IMHO it doesn't change things for this intented (mis)use of DNS,
so DNSSEC should only increase the size of responses...

PS: my reasoning is to get a such name or RR doesn't exist response *or*
no response won't really make a difference.

This has been an argument that has been present since... 10yrs ago.
In general, I would agree that you should not overload the DNS (e.g., using
DNS to distribute any type of certificates - like user certs - bad idea),
however I also think that the scope we identified is very well defined and
that will *NOT overload the DNS at all*.

Also, since these responses go through DNS, it might solve the problem with
some environments (e.g., web-portals) where traffic toward OCSP servers
might be blocked - usually DNS lookups are enabled in that environment.

This would help to enable revocation checking also before having complete
access to the net - e.g., revocation checking might be enabled also in hotel-like
portal access.

I think that you (and some others in the list) are missing the point that we need to specify
a bit more than just a URI.

There are several problems with the RFC 4501 to be used in this proposal. Keep in mind that
the RFC is meant to specify DNS URIs, but it does not cover the fact that we need to specify
additional information that the client MUST use to build the final URL. In particular, we 
can not
use RFC 4501 URLs because of two important points (I guess this will put an end to this
discussion on using RFC 4501):

- RFC 4501 does not allow to specify dns vs dnssec. If an operator wants to convey that the
   returned DNS response WILL be signed, if the URL does not carry that information, the 
client
   can not tell if the received response should be signed or not.

   As it was said in another message, DNSSEC can guarantee the non-existance of the 
record, i.e.
   if a record is not found and the response is correctly signed, the client will know 
that it has to
   use another source. On the other hand, if a record should be signed, but a non-signed 
record
   is received, this is a source of attack and should be treated as such.

- In order to identify the certificate that needs to be checked, the client has to use an hash
   function to build the DNS entry that should be looked up for. We have two options here.
   Either we stick with one algorithm (default) as we did in the past for most algorithms (but
   this would violate the "algorithm-agility" principle), or have a way to specify 
different algorithms
   so that the client knows what to use when building  the DNS URI. If we go with the second
   route (which I think we should) we need to be able to specify the algorithm. RFC 4501 is to
   be used to extract DNS records, and works fine for that, however we need to be able to 
specify
   the algorithm. We still have not addresses if we want to be able to provide the 
possibility to pass
   also additional parameters that are specific for the algorithm (as pointed out in 
another email
   the GOST hash is one of those algorithm that requires additional parameters).

These two reasons make RFC 4501 *not suitable* to specify DNS URI for OCSP responses because
we need to provide information on how to get to the final URL.

Why can't we just specify the full address of the certificate in the DNS URI ? The answer 
is simple:
you don't have the final DER representation of the certificate until the CA has signed it, 
so you can
not include that value in the certificate to be signed.

The only workaround to this would be if we use a hash of the serial number to be pre-pended to
the domain the CA is managing - however I would suggest against it as this might also be 
an issue
with some CA software (the serial number might be assigned randomly at signing time and 
changes
to the software might be required - a static approach would be easier to deploy).

Last but not least, the final I-D could also provide the possibility to specify multiple 
supported algorithms
(eg., future transitions among algorithms). Also in this case RFC 4501 would not provide a 
suitable
solution for that.

Cheers,

I conducted an experiment for testing the viability of wide-spread
OCSP over DNS with Chrome. Please see the writeup below, although note
that it was conducted some months ago and so words like "today" don't
actually mean that.

-----
* This has only been enabled in Canary and Dev channels. These channels have
  users who have opted in to running unstable versions of Chrome and so are not
  representative in some ways.


Setup:

For each HTTP request, we consider if it meets all of the following criteria:

1) The request went over HTTPS
2) The reply didn't come from the Chrome cache
3) The certificate rooted at a known public root (i.e. the connection was not
   MITMed with a user-installed CA cert)
4) The certificate chain passed through at least one of the following:

AAACertificateServices
AddTrustClass1CARoot
AddTrustExternalCARoot
AddTrustPublicCARoot
AddTrustQualifiedCARoot
COMODOCertificationAuthority
SecureCertificateServices
TrustedCertificateServices
UTNDATACorpSGC
UTNUSERFirstClientAuthenticationandEmail
UTNUSERFirstHardware
UTNUSERFirstObject

5) It was more than 10 minutes since the last time we tried a DNS lookup for
this experiment.

If we find a qualifing HTTP request then we issue a TXT lookup for
"wibble.comodoca.com" via the system's resolver library.

If the DNS reply comes back in under 10 milliseconds, then we consider it a
local cache hit and discard it. (We have an in-process cache as well as any
system cache.)

Any remaining replies are considered a `success' if the system resolver
returned successfully and we find the string "wibble" in the RR data payload.
Otherwise they are considered a `failure'.

The time taken for the resolution is recorded for both `success' and `failure'
responses. Recorded time values are capped to 10 seconds.


Results:

As of today we have 71,833 successes recorded. The distribution looks as
expected: a big hump with a fat right tail. The median is 95ms, 90% at 533ms,
99% at 5961ms.

We also have 3,537 failures recorded. 84.7% of these have times > 10s.  There
is also a 3.5% peak at 3s (i.e. 3 attempts with a one second retry). The
remaining ~10% is scattered mostly uniformly.


Conclusions:

The median is a lot better than an OCSP reponse (which is 268ms at the moment),
but the failure rate (4.7%) is very high.

Cheers

Hello Francis,

Thanks for the comments - as Scott wrote, it would be interesting if you could
let us know what is, specifically, that you do not like and how this could be
a problem for PKIs (why it should not be standardized).

Our attempt is to provide another mechanism that CAs can use (if they want to)
to distribute pre-computed OCSP responses - cheap, easy to deploy, and that
would deliver (by using the DNS caching) the response close to the client (thus,
enhancing their availability).

Issue:
- We need to improve the availability of OCSP responses. Today, the quality of service
   across different CAs is not enough for applications to enable strict revocation
   checking (issues: costs and connectivity issues (eg., latency))

The starting points for our proposal are:
- We should try to provide an infrastructure for OCSP checking (rev info checking)
   that minimize unavailability of data because of network issues
- Pre-computed OCSP responses can be provided via different access methods
   (e.g., HTTP, CDNs, FTP, etc.)
- For high-volume websites, huge bandwidth is required on the OCSP side to provide
   services that meet the expectations (and high costs) of clients
- Availability of OCSP responses could be increased by using widely deployed and
   distributed services like DNS / DNSSEC

Given the problem, the well-defined boundaries, and the considerations on the need
to address the availability of revocation information, we think that this I-D could
provide a well-targeted mid-term solution to the issue.

Any input on the matter that takes in consideration the above points, is more than
welcome as the purpose here is to address a real issue that affects practically all
the Internet users.

Best,
Max

I think you need to be a little more careful about your assumptions in
this case.  In my experience, large numbers of web portals permit DNS
lookups _for some value of "permit"_.  Many of them munge or otherwise
mangle the DNS responses, and I have seen shipping DNS middleboxes
that return an A response no matter what RRTYPE you looked up.  The
most egregious of these things are gradually getting ditched with the
deployment of DNSSEC, but there's still a lot of garbage out there.

This is especially true on public wifi networks, one of the places
that good revokation checking is most urgently needed.

This isn't an argument against the idea, just a note of caution about
the operational realities of the network.

Best,

Thanks Simon.

I'll include your updates. They seem fine with me.

No I don't have an XML. I use the Awesome NroffEdit tool :)

As I read it, if you aren't a CA and generate a self-signed certificate,
then that certificate isn't a PKIX certificate.  Is that statement
right?

If so, it sort of screws up draft-ietf-dane-protocol:

=46rom section 2.2.1:
#     3 -- Certificate usage 3 is used to specify a certificate, or the
#     public key of such a certificate, that MUST match the end entity
#     certificate given by the server in TLS.  This certificate usage is
#     sometimes referred to as "domain-issued certificate" because it
#     allows for a domain name administrator to issue certificates for a
#     domain without involving a third-party CA.  The target certificate
#     MUST match the TLSA record.  The difference between certificate
#     usage 1 and certificate usage 3 is that certificate usage 1
#     requires that the certificate pass PKIX validation, but PKIX
#     validation is not tested for certificate usage 3.
#
#  The certificate usages defined in this document explicitly only apply
#  to PKIX-formatted certificates in DER encoding [X.690].  If TLS
#  allows other formats later, or if extensions to this RRtype are made
#  that accept other formats for certificates, those certificates will
#  need their own certificate usage values.

(TLSA Certificate usage 3 is intended for self-signed "PKIX"
certificates.)

Maybe the problem is that we talk about PKIX-formatted certificates vs.
PKIX-validated certificates, but both are handled in RFC 5280.

Can we distinguish the two?

Partially. Those certificates are outside the scope of PKIX. However...

No. It is intended for PKIX-formatted certificates, which is exactly =
what the DANE spec says.

Can you say why that's a problem?

Yes, easily.

Because someone could easily use that paragraph to say, "there's no such
thing as a PKIX-formatted certificate that isn't PKIX-validatable."=20

RFC 5280 =3D=3D PKIX, so being out of scope of RFC 5280 makes it not
PKIX-anything.  After all, how the certificate is signed determines if
it's in scope of PKIX.

>=20
> Yes, easily.

I'd suggest we do that.  I think think that's why people were trying to
inject "use of" the certificates instead of "generation of" the certs--
to make that distinction.

I'd be happier if the last sentence read:

"Validation of these certificates, and how a relying party authenticates
the asserted identities, are both outside the scope of RFC 5280."

Then it makes sense for a certificate to be a PKIX[-formatted]
certificate, but not PKIX-validatable.

Hi Scott and Massimiliano,

As someone who has implemented a very large OCSP service for a well-known C=
A and implemented parts of the software infrastructure very large DNS servi=
ce operator, I think your proposal has general merit. I have reviewed the p=
roposal although I am still thinking through some of the responses I've see=
n so far and apparently have to catch-up on details such as RFC 4501.

First, I would respond to the comments about overloading a DNS operation. I=
n my experience, DNS is significantly lighter than a TCP-based OCSP and wou=
ld take very considerably less computational (and likely network) resources=
 once implemented than an equivalent OCSP responder service. I've long thou=
ght, since the initial inception of the "lightweight OCSP profile" in RFC 5=
019, that an even lighter way would be to use UDP. It has been my experienc=
e that the TCP connection overhead is not only significant for increased cl=
ient latency, but also significant in the computational resources of the se=
rvers.=20

Besides the possibility of using UDP to reduce latency, I see the ability t=
o use anycasting, quite typical in DNS service providers, to be a viable op=
tion for distributing load. In earlier experiments, I have noticed that any=
casting TCP services does not work well for some clients, most likely due t=
o network misconfiguration. That data point is now a few years old.

I do have a one question when I was reading through your proposal text. It =
sounds like you are considering the DNS query as between the client directl=
y to the CA's DNS service. Why not make use of the distributed nature of th=
e DNS to make the request to a local resolver and possibly get the advantag=
e of local caching? That is a more typical model for DNS (e.g. make a reque=
st to a local resolver; local resolver makes recursive requests to authorit=
ative servers). My only observation about this approach is that using a "dn=
ssec" URI doesn't make sense since local resolvers will do the DNSSEC valid=
ation, not the client.

One potential downside I see is with the security guarantees. It is pretty =
easy to forge UDP responses, and although the OCSP response is signed, one =
could invent cases where "OCSP good" responses were replayed (when the cert=
ificate had been revoked, but was still within the OCSP expiration window) =
or worse: the unsigned "Unknown" response could be blasted much easier than=
 if the service were implemented over TCP.

That all said, I'm on board in concept.

Thanks,

Michael

Steve,

I vote for D; i.e. :

D - the respondent volunteers to work on a new version of 2560bis.

I hope to be able to deliver such a new version within two weeks from now.

I plan to add explanations:
   - for OCSP clients when they build a request,
   - for OCSP clients when they verify a response.

As an example, explanations are missing to explain how to process the=20
responderID field from a ResponseData.

I plan to add requirements related to key rollover :
    1 - CA key rollover (without delegated OCSP responder),
    2 - delegated OCSP responders:
          - OCSP key rollover (without CA key rollover),
          - CA key rollover without a new OCSP key, and
          - CA key rollover with a new OCSP key.

I plan to work from version -05 which is not "good enough", but=20
much better than version -04 with all its annexes.

Denis

Folks,

Recent messages exchanges point to significant disagreement about the=20
future direction
for this doc. At the March meeting Stefan presented a proposal for how=20
to move
ahead, as outlined in his slides. As noted in the minutes, the audience=20
(at the mic)
included one indication of support for this streamlined approach, and=20
one expression
of concern. Not a lot of interest.

Work on this doc has dragged on for 2 years now. In October of 2011=20
Santosh argued that
version -04 of the doc was, in his opinion, a step backwards, adding=20
more confusion to
RFC 2560 vs. clarifying it. Stefan agreed (in a message in March of=20
2012), and
thus he created the current, stripped-down version of the doc (-05)=20
which was published
recently.

Given the mixed response to this version, it's not clear that the WG=20
members who are interested
in OCSP clarifications are in agreement on how to proceed.

So, let's begin a straw poll on the topic.  Here are the options I am=20
offering:

     A - continue to work with the -05 version as the basis for an RFC
     B - revert to the -04 version as the basis for an RFC
     C - don't publish a clarifications document for OCSP
     D - the respondent volunteers to work on a new version of 2560bis

Please send your replies to the list starting now. The straw poll will=20
close
in two weeks, on August 12. While there are many other, legitimate=20
comments one could
offer, I am interested only in replies to this multiple choice straw=20
poll (i.e., no
essay replies :-) )

Thanks,

Steve

<br>
<br><tt><font size=3D2>Folks,<br>
<br>
Recent messages exchanges point to significant disagreement about the <br>
future direction<br>
for this doc. At the March meeting Stefan presented a proposal for how
<br>
to move<br>
ahead, as outlined in his slides. As noted in the minutes, the audience
<br>
(at the mic)<br>
included one indication of support for this streamlined approach, and <br>
one expression<br>
of concern. Not a lot of interest.<br>
<br>
Work on this doc has dragged on for 2 years now. In October of 2011 <br>
Santosh argued that<br>
version -04 of the doc was, in his opinion, a step backwards, adding <br>
more confusion to<br>
RFC 2560 vs. clarifying it. Stefan agreed (in a message in March of <br>
2012), and<br>
thus he created the current, stripped-down version of the doc (-05) <br>
which was published<br>
recently.<br>
<br>
Given the mixed response to this version, it's not clear that the WG <br>
members who are interested<br>
in OCSP clarifications are in agreement on how to proceed.<br>
<br>
So, let's begin a straw poll on the topic. &nbsp;Here are the options I
am <br>
offering:<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; A - continue to work with the -05 version as the basis for
an RFC<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; B - revert to the -04 version as the basis for an RFC<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; C - don't publish a clarifications document for OCSP<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; D - the respondent volunteers to work on a new version of
2560bis<br>
<br>
Please send your replies to the list starting now. The straw poll will
close<br>
in two weeks, on August 12. While there are many other, legitimate <br>
comments one could<br>
offer, I am interested only in replies to this multiple choice straw <br>
poll (i.e., no<br>
essay replies :-) )<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

Martin,

I agree with you that only two cases (besides a local configuration which=20
is OPTIONAL) SHALL be supported.
However, I would rephrase it slightly differently:

The key that is able to verify a SingleResponse (within a=20
BasicOCSPResponse) MUST be :
(1) either the certificate signer key,
(2) or the key from an OCSP responder signed by the certificate signer=20
key,
    and in this case the OCSP responder cert MUST be included in the OCSP=20
response.=20

I haven't fully read through this, but it appears to be quite related
to my complaint about Appendix E of the -04 document to be lacking
requirements on inclusion of which particular certs in the OCSP response
in order to provide a basis for interop.  Without such requirements
about which certs must be present in the OCSP response, interop will
remain a lucky coincidence rather than a result of conscious design
decisions.

And as an implementor, I would limit my OCSP to exactly two cases:
(1) certificate signer key also signed the OCSP response
(2) certificate signer key also signed an OCSP responder cert,
    and this OCSP responder cert MUST be included in the OCSP response.=20

First, the rest of my reply was under the stated premise:

=3D
=3D This sounds like you're asking for =5Fchanging=5F the existing protocol
=3D by publishing a new spec with different or additional requirements.


and secondly, I'm against requiring OCSP clients to support fancy PKI
models.  However the complete lack of details what needs to be included
in an OCSP response in order to provide a basis for interop is a
DEFECT of rfc2560.=20

I would be perfectly OK with augmenting the existing spec with
something like

"In order to provide reliable interoperability on
this protocol options, the following additional requirements are
necessary, that are not part of rfc2560 (but might have been
obvious implications for some implementors anyhow".

If you approach rfc2560 from the viewpoint of formal correctness proofing,
you will immediately notice which protocol options are underspecified
and where you will encounter interop problems with implementers who
do not read a spec and create an implementation with any kind of formal
correctness in mind (i.e. planned and predictable behaviour
in unknown future usage scenarios).

rfcdiff visualizes this as newly added text:

http://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=3Drfc2560.txt&url2=3Ddraft-ietf-pkix-rfc=
2560bis-04.txt


...which is one of the reasons that I'm violently opposed to
completely rearrange the document structure in the fasion of -04


Concerning the same info in section of rfc2560 section 3.2
a clarifying text that the ordering in the enumeration is not normative,
and it might be sensible to perform the public key signature verification
at the end, rather than as 2nd check, because it is likely the most
"expensive" operation and one should avoid making public key crypto
operations with public keys before it has been established that these
keys are trustworthy.

Quoting from rfc5280, section 5.1.1.3

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5.1.1.3

                     The use of separate CA certificates for validation
   of certificate signatures and CRL signatures can offer improved
   security characteristics; however, it imposes a burden on
   applications, and it might limit interoperability.  Many applications
   construct a certification path, and then validate the certification
   path (Section 6).  CRL checking in turn requires a separate
   certification path to be constructed and validated for the CA's CRL
*> signature validation certificate.  Applications that perform CRL
*> checking MUST support certification path validation when certificates
*> and CRLs are digitally signed with the same CA private key.  These
   applications SHOULD support certification path validation when
   certificates and CRLs are digitally signed with different CA private
   keys.


rfc5280 is pretty explicit that support for CRLs that are not signed
by the same CA key that signed the certificate is OPTIONAL, because
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT RPs will likely not support it.

Keep in mind that CRLs, in contrast to OCSP, lack a standardized
carry-on container for CRL signer certificates.


Keep also in mind, that construction(!) of a certificate path is
explicitly outside of the scope of rfc5280.  Which more-or-less
means that all options described in rfc5280 that require certificate
path construction are implicitly outside the scope of rfc5280 as well
(and very likely missing in minimum requirement RPs):

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-73

   The primary goal of path validation is to verify the binding between
   a subject distinguished name or a subject alternative name and
   subject public key, as represented in the target certificate, based
   on the public key of the trust anchor.  In most cases, the target
   certificate will be an end entity certificate, but the target
   certificate may be a CA certificate as long as the subject public key
   is to be used for a purpose other than verifying the signature on a
   public key certificate.  Verifying the binding between the name and
   subject public key requires obtaining a sequence of certificates that
*> support that binding.  The procedure performed to obtain this
*> sequence of certificates is outside the scope of this specification.

That is a misunderstanding.  I'm perfectly aware and OK with this.

What is lacking in RFC2560, and should be added in rfc2560bis is
that when using a different OCSP signer cert, then the OCSP server
MUST include all certs that will be necessary for processing this
OCSP response *within* the OCSP response.

In general, this also means that the examples in
Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 of -04 are incorrect, because
in general a cross-cert between the cert-signing CA cert and the
OCSP-responder signing CA cert will be necessary, unless the
OCSP request contains an unambiguous proof that the OCSP client
is in posession of the rootCA cert from Figures 7, 8, 9

...which is one of the reasons that I'm violently opposed to<br>
completely rearrange the document structure in the fasion of -04<br>
<br>
<br>
Concerning the same info in section of rfc2560 section 3.2<br>
a clarifying text that the ordering in the enumeration is not normative,<br>
and it might be sensible to perform the public key signature verification<b=
r>
at the end, rather than as 2nd check, because it is likely the most<br>
&quot;expensive&quot; operation and one should avoid making public key
crypto<br>
operations with public keys before it has been established that these<br>
keys are trustworthy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; You also misrepresent RFC 5280 in your message. &nbsp;RFC 5280 very
clearly <br>
&gt; allows CAs to sign CRLs with a different key than was used to sign
the <br>
&gt; certificates covered by the CRL, and notes that it may be necessary
for <br>
&gt; a relying party to build a separate certification path for the <br>
&gt; certificate needed to verify the signature on the CRL.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quoting from rfc5280, section 5.1.1.3<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; </font></tt><a href=3D"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5=
.1.1.3"><tt><font size=3D2>http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5.1.1=
.3</font></tt></a><tt><font size=3D2><br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The use of separate CA certificates for validation<br>
 &nbsp; of certificate signatures and CRL signatures can offer improved<br>
 &nbsp; security characteristics; however, it imposes a burden on<br>
 &nbsp; applications, and it might limit interoperability. &nbsp;Many appli=
cations<br>
 &nbsp; construct a certification path, and then validate the certification=
<br>
 &nbsp; path (Section 6). &nbsp;CRL checking in turn requires a separate<br>
 &nbsp; certification path to be constructed and validated for the CA's
CRL<br>
*&gt; signature validation certificate. &nbsp;Applications that perform
CRL<br>
*&gt; checking MUST support certification path validation when certificates=
<br>
*&gt; and CRLs are digitally signed with the same CA private key. &nbsp;The=
se<br>
 &nbsp; applications SHOULD support certification path validation when<br>
 &nbsp; certificates and CRLs are digitally signed with different CA privat=
e<br>
 &nbsp; keys.<br>
<br>
<br>
rfc5280 is pretty explicit that support for CRLs that are not signed<br>
by the same CA key that signed the certificate is OPTIONAL, because<br>
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT RPs will likely not support it.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that CRLs, in contrast to OCSP, lack a standardized<br>
carry-on container for CRL signer certificates.<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep also in mind, that construction(!) of a certificate path is<br>
explicitly outside of the scope of rfc5280. &nbsp;Which more-or-less<br>
means that all options described in rfc5280 that require certificate<br>
path construction are implicitly outside the scope of rfc5280 as well<br>
(and very likely missing in minimum requirement RPs):<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; </font></tt><a href=3D"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-73">=
<tt><font size=3D2>http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-73</font></tt></=
a><tt><font size=3D2><br>
<br>
 &nbsp; The primary goal of path validation is to verify the binding betwee=
n<br>
 &nbsp; a subject distinguished name or a subject alternative name and<br>
 &nbsp; subject public key, as represented in the target certificate, based=
<br>
 &nbsp; on the public key of the trust anchor. &nbsp;In most cases, the
target<br>
 &nbsp; certificate will be an end entity certificate, but the target<br>
 &nbsp; certificate may be a CA certificate as long as the subject public
key<br>
 &nbsp; is to be used for a purpose other than verifying the signature
on a<br>
 &nbsp; public key certificate. &nbsp;Verifying the binding between the
name and<br>
 &nbsp; subject public key requires obtaining a sequence of certificates
that<br>
*&gt; support that binding. &nbsp;The procedure performed to obtain this<br>
*&gt; sequence of certificates is outside the scope of this specification.<=
br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As for OCSP, contrary to your assertion, relying parties are *NOT*<br>
&gt; required to be able to validate responses if the response<br>
&gt; (or the responder's certificate) was signed with a different key<br>
&gt; than the target certificate.<br>
<br>
That is a misunderstanding. &nbsp;I'm perfectly aware and OK with this.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I cannot find a single statement in RFC 2560 that states <br>
&gt; that conforming applications MUST be able to validate such responses,
<br>
&gt; and so there is no such statement in 2560bis either.<br>
<br>
What is lacking in RFC2560, and should be added in rfc2560bis is<br>
that when using a different OCSP signer cert, then the OCSP server<br>
MUST include all certs that will be necessary for processing this<br>
OCSP response *within* the OCSP response.<br>
<br>
In general, this also means that the examples in<br>
Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 of -04 are incorrect, because<br>
in general a cross-cert between the cert-signing CA cert and the<br>
OCSP-responder signing CA cert will be necessary, unless the<br>
OCSP request contains an unambiguous proof that the OCSP client<br>
is in posession of the rootCA cert from Figures 7, 8, 9<br>
<br>

Hi everyone, 

 

Because there are a variety of instances where a DNS record might not
accurately reflect the appropriate issuing CA (such as improper updating, a
delay in display, etc.) and compliance with this RFC is entirely voluntary
by the CA community, the requirements in Section 3 should be changed from
"MUST" to "SHOULD" recommendations.  Changing this section would allow
implementing CAs to accommodate customers who do not have a streamlined DNS
record updating system and make implementation more practical.

 

I also think the section on using DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs needs
further development. The recommendation to use DNSSEC in connection with the
proposal would be strengthened significantly if the proposal required the
DNS record holder to maintain and make available an archive of DNS records
instead of issuing CAs.

 

My biggest concern would be addressing the potential abuse mentioned in
Section 5.5.  Many enterprises have separate roles or departments that
handle DNS records from those ordering digital certificates. In fact, these
roles are often not in the same country.  This creates a 

probable point of failure by the implementers.  This separation between
certificate requesters and DNS record controllers also increases the risk
that the criticality flag can be abused as the controllers may be unaware of
the variety of certificates uses within the enterprises.  A bad-acting CA
could lock the enterprise into a long term and exclusive agreement without
the enterprise fully realizing the practical impact of agreement.  The
document should address the issue further and provide a recommendation on
how to overcome this likely scenario.

 

Jeremy

Dear colleagues,

I strongly disagree with that.  The section is considering how CAA
works for implementers.  If a CA doesn't want to implement it, the
MUST just doesn't have any effect.  If there are problems with the
operation of the DNS zone, it seems to me that the MUST becomes yet
another constraint on that operation.

SHOULD does not mean "oughta do this except when you don't".  It means
"you better have pretty good reasons not to do this".  If the zone
you're querying is wrong, you can't tell whether that's because the
zone has been subverted, the zone is administered by numbskulls, or
what.  Therefore, if you're using CAA, you shouldn't issue (and if
you're not using CAA, the MUST doesn't apply to you anyway).

I don't understand this claim.  What's the additional strength from
this?  What the zone looked like in the past is surely irrelevant to
the current CAA query, no?

This sounds like an argument that, because people don't know how to
operate their zones, we should make the protocol less rigorous.  I
cannot agree with such a proposal (any more than I think the proposals
to use fudge-factor DNSSEC validation or, for that matter,
long-expired A RRs are good ideas).  If you want to put stuff in the
DNS, you need to make sure you do it correctly.  If you think your DNS
department is too incompetent to use CAA correctly in your zone, don't
use CAA at all.  (I acknowledge, however, that "Don't use CAA at all,"
would be much happier advice if the only place the CAA record was
checked was at the owner name itself, rather than using the
tree-climbing crud the WG seems to want.)

Best,

A

Scott,

I tend to think of cert validation as equivalent to authentication of 
asserted
identities, but I am in favor trying to make this as clear as possible. 
Your text drops
the phrase "These certificates" which in intended to address the format 
part of the
topic. So, how about:

*"These certificates, and how a relying party uses them to authenticate 
the asserted
identities (certificate validation), are both outside the scope of RFC 
5280."
*
Steve

No, I'm *trying* to exclude the formatting.  Other RFCs refer to 5280 as
a way to format certificates.  I think it's legitimate to say that this
formatting as defined by 5280 is in scope of 5280.  (From what I read,
the X.509 spec is unusuable on its own -- it needs a profiling
specification like PKIX.) As I see it, the contention over self-signed
non-CA certificates isn't their formatting, it's their
validity/authentication.  I'm trying to make those two issues distinct.

Myself, I don't do formal correctness proofs (I do not have such huge
amounts of time at my disposition) [*].

But once you understand how formal correctness proofing works in principle,
you can use the underlying methods to check some specification
feature/protocol option for "obvious" defects (contradictions or
ambiguities).  Defects in a spec often cause interop problems.
Sometimes defects will require a disambiguation before being
implementable, but not all implementors ask for disambiguation,
(ab)use a misspecified protocol option in the fashion they see fit
and ship their implementation of it.

And sometimes defects can be recognized and overcome by redundant
information in the spec, but not all implementors are equally gifted
in deducting what the spec should have correctly said.


X.509 and PKIX contain so many inconsistencies and ambiguities
that one will probably have to change or drop at least half of X.509 spec
in order to obtain correctness.  Considering the size and complexity
of these specs, it looks like a multi-man-year effort to me.


So what I'm doing about OCSP is looking at the "minimum requirements"
OCSP client & responder, and which parts of the more complex options
will cause interop problems with a high probability.


-Martin

 [*] In 1996 a student from the University of Karlsruhe was doing his
     master thesis at my company, a tool-based formal correctness proof
     of a specific subset of our authorziation scheme.  He was helping
     the developers to create the detailed specification, while he
     was doing the translation into predicate logic and updating the
     specification to accomodate for ambiguities and inconsistencies
     that the tool encountered.  It took him 4 months.
     The tool that he used was "Karlsruhe Interactive Verifier (KIV)"

     Personally, I'm _not_ intimate with all the theory behind it,
     and was disappointed by the ROI, but I really liked the underlying
     principles and adopted them for spec-reviewing and programming and
     used them in 1996-1998 for reviewing the subset of GSS-API v2
     (rfc2743/2744) that we use in our software.

     When I applied this methods in Nov 2009 to during discussion
     of TLS channel bindings on the TLS mailing list, after I had
     understood what Nico&Larry were trying to accomplish, I tried
     describing to them why their desired behaviour was incompatible
     with the existing TLS renegotiation as specified:

       http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03922.html

     On my way home, it dawned on me that certain application designs
     might be blindly relying on a TLS protocol characteristic that
     really did not exist, and would likely be susceptible to MitM:

       http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03928.html

     The TLS renegotiation MitM problem (and the full scope of the
     vulnerability) had been independently discovered 2 months earlier
     and resulted in a closed group secretly working on a fix:

       http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03942.html

     And some 1500 messages later in the discussion, I gave a very
     rough sketch how to apply semi-formal logic to compare two different
     approaches to specify a protocol feature with each other:

This thread is about OCSP, not about X.509 or PKIX (aka 5280) isn't it?

Many folks, me included, believe that the formatting is not consistent 
with 5280,
which is why we are going to the trouble of making this change. The 
formatting
issue is that, in general, the issuer of a cert IS implicitly a CA, and 
thus a self-signed
cert needs to contain a basic constraints extension, with the CA flag 
set TRUE. The certs that
we are working to accommodate are not formatted consistent with this 
interpretation of 5280,
hence the changed text.

Since your motivation for the rewording is at odds with that, I'll 
retract my proposed change.

While this specific thread is about OCSP, OCSP is not an isolated
piece of technology, but based on PKIX/rfc5280.  You can not review
the facier options of OCSP without including rfc5280&X.509 in the review.

The carry-on container in OCSP for the OCSP signer certificate is
a sequence of certificates, not a singular cert.  So for the
fancy options where the CA key/cert that signed the certificate
under examination is neither the signer of the OCSP response,
nor the signer of the OCSP signer cert, more than one cert
may be required for the purpose of checking the OCSP signer
cert for revocation.  How to obtain the certs is *not* specified
in rfc2560.  Chasing AIA of a cert that hasn't been verified yet
would be a serious vulnerability.

At the moment I do not see any reasonable alternative to requiring
the inclusion of all necessary certs in the the OCSP response.
But rfc2560 does not mandate a particular ordering of the certs
in the OCSP response, and how to build a certification path
is explicitly outside of the scope of PKIX/rfc5280.

  "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike" 

Reviewing a specification prior to implementing it means recognizing
protocol options that are well-defined and where interop can reasonably
be expected (when implemented by the peer), and distinguishing them
from protocol options that are ambiguous/underspecified and/or partially
out-of-scope is important, or you might see your expectations (about
interop) differ from reality.

I would appreciate when early adopters, who are pushing for a spec
would do a careful review of the spec before it is finalized/published,
so that the spec can be fixed/clarified before there is a huge installed
base.  Often they're primarily focused on specific usage scenarios
on their minds, and whether the spec contains sufficient "slack" for
their purposes & "creativity".

As with all specifications, MUST means 'you must do this to be in
compliance with this specification'.

Hence CAA specifies MUST since they are normative. CAA is no more
voluntary than any other IETF specification. CAs can choose to
implement it or not but they may well find it more difficult to get
their trust anchors embedded if they don't.

CAs are in any case subject to an audit regime and so if they claim
compliance and don't implement they can fail their audit.

There are pros and cons to using DNS. What we really need to do is to
measure cases where DNS transport works but UDP does not and the cases
where UDP transport works but DNS does not and see whether DNS is
actually useful.

The only potential benefit of using DNS is that it may be easier to
get connectivity through firewalls.

The potential benefit of using UDP is that an OCSP response could
consist of one request packet and a series of response packets. That
is probably enough to satisfy an reasonable OSCP transaction.


The other design question is whether the client should query the
responder of a CA or direct requests to a gateway chosen by the client
(or client provider) that is known to meet an acceptable QoS. The
problem I see with the OCSP over DNS approach is that the complaint
from the browser providers is not merely that OCSP over HTTP is slow,
it is that they are really unhappy with the reliability of some of the
CA services.

Now that might be possible to address if there was a consequence to
having shitty OCSP service. I would like to see the padlock icon not
show if the CA can't provide a decent responder. But they may not go
for that.

 In my experience, DNS is significantly lighter than a TCP-based OCSP and w=

Henry,

Your observation is accurate, but no one objected to the options when I 
posted
them. Also, during the course of the poll, there were several "essay" 
responses,
none of which suggested that course of action.

So, I don't see a need to revisit this topic at this point.

Steve

Scott,

How is this proposal positioned in relation to OCSP stapling.
Would we need either or, or both?

I've seen two questions on what RRTYPE you would use, whether a new need
to be defined and what deployment issues that would bring to the table.
What is your position on that?

/Stefan

Note: This question is not about chaining OCSP. It is about what would be
compliant with the current spec.




I'm having some exchange with members of CAB forum regarding their use of
OCSP.

They want to require OCSP responders belonging to compliant CAs to NOT
return a "good" response unless they have a record of the certificate
being asked about.

It seems to me that it would be perfectly in line with current OCSP spec
to return "unknown" in case the CA has no record of the certificate being
asked about.

Current text from RFC 2560:
  The "unknown" state indicates that the responder doesn't know about
  the certificate being requested.



Does anyone have a different opinion?

/Stefan

For of all, thank you Henry for your posting.

Steve, do you mean that it is possible to object when the chairs are=20
proposing a straw poll ?
I was not thinking it was ever possible, so I did not objected.

Steve, you said:=20

"Also, during the course of the poll, there were several "essay"=20
responses, none of which suggested that course of action".

This is not quite true. On August 6, I wrote to the list:

        "I hope to be able to deliver such a new version within two weeks=20
from now.

        I plan to add explanations:
=20
                - for OCSP clients when they build a request,
                - for OCSP clients when they verify a response.
        (...)

        I plan to work from version -05 which is not "good enough", but=20
        much better than version -04 with all its annexes."

Two weeks from August 6 means August 20.

I have already spent about 20 hours to prepare this document starting from =

version -05.
.i.e. one of the two proposed versions of the strawpol (and the one which=20
won the strawpol).

In fact, I did a lot more than the announced explanations, including=20
additional text in=20
the security considerations section. The changes, mostly additional text,=20
will be indicated=20
at the beginning of the document.

The draft document is currently still being reviewed by a few people=20
within my company.

I still hope to be able to post it close to August 20.

On August 10, the co-chairs privately received an intermediate copy of the =

draft, so they could start=20
to build their own opinion about the improvements made, but I have=20
received no private response from=20
the co-chairs yet at this time.

The question for me, at the time being, is whether I can post the drat as=20
:

      draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis-06

or whether I should post it as :

      draft-ietf-pinkas-rfc2560bis-00

Steve, would you please provide an answer to that question ?

Your observation is accurate, but no one objected to the options when I
<br>
posted<br>
them. Also, during the course of the poll, there were several &quot;essay&q=

<br>
responses,<br>
none of which suggested that course of action.<br>
<br>
So, I don't see a need to revisit this topic at this point.<br>

:)

Yes. This is the perennial debate, since the early days of OCSP.

There are actually two discussions. 1/ should we at all allow the issuance
question to be answered in the protocol 2/ if we do, how should it be
expressed? There are good arguments both ways regarding 1, but I feel we
should, and doing that answer 2 just to put this dead horse to rest once
and for all.

In my mind the three possible responses are "good", "bad" and "don't know,
ask someone else if you really want to know". Granted, the wording of the
"unknown" definition is a bit vague, but it cannot be read as an
affirmative response about the non-existence of a certificate. The real
problem is that "bad" is labeled "revoked" in the document and defined only
as such. The "good" definition on the other hand foresees the issuance
question:

   The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.

My position is that reading "unknown" as an assertion of non-issuance is
contrived. It is more reasonable to read it as "...the responder doesn't
know about [the status of] the certificate requested" (as in I can't map
the CertID to any CA, or I am temporarily offline with regards to that CA).
Looks very much more like an editing error than anything else.

The client can only do three thing as a result of an OCSP response: accept
the certificate, reject it, or try to get better information later or at
some other place. There is little point in having two "reject" responses,
especially if it comes at the expense of the
"try-somewhere-else-or-come-back-later-if-you-have-time" response.

I propose that we resolve this by defining the extension that the "good"
definition talks about, and changing the label of "revoked" to be "bad". I
suggest that if you want the responder to answer the question about
issuance, you use a single request extension to signal that. And if you
want to answer the question, you answer good if it is issued and not
revoked or bad/revoked if it is non-issued with reason code certificate
hold and an invalidity date at the beginning of time; adding a single
response extension in both cases to show that you have considered the
issuance question. The exact syntax of the single request/response
extension can be discussed, but it potentially could include a hash of the
certificate at hand.

This would leave us with three orthogonal response states:
"good"/"bad"/"don't-know" and clear out a lot of confusion.

I agree with you. For a responder this is definitely in line with the spec.

If a label change is permitted (in 2560bis), I'd prefer to see "good" 
changed to "not revoked".

Hi Simon,

Your read more into my question than I asked (or proposed).

I never asked/suggested that the unknown response should be interpreted as =
a
confirmation that the certificate was never issued.
The question was whether it would be conformant to send the "unknown"
response if the cert has never been issued.

Do you see the difference?

In the context of my question, the client would not know that the
certificate was never issued. It would simply know that the responder don't
know about the cert for any given reason you mention.

Yes I agree we would need an extension to signal (if at all) an explicit
confirmation that the certificate was never issued. The question is still
what response that could be returned if that extension states that the
certificate was never issued.

There are only three to choose from good, revoked and unknown. It seems to
me that "unknown" is the only reasonable alternative as both "good" and
"revoked" are clearly wrong.

/Stefan

I'm reluctant to rename these labels of OCSP.

These labels are not UI components, they are simply labels used in the
protocol.
Changing labels in ASN.1 is problematic as ASN.1 often is compiled into
code where the labels form variable names.

Changing label names thus creates unnecessary problems for implementers.

It is better then to clarify the labels if necessary.

RFC2560 says:
    The "unknown" state indicates that the responder doesn't know about
    the certificate being requested.

How could "unknown" possibly be the correct response if the responder 
_does know_ for certain that the "certificate being requested" was never 
issued?

 > as both "good" and "revoked" are clearly wrong.

I agree that "revoked" is clearly wrong, since a certificate must first 
have been issued before it can be revoked.

So IMHO, the "good" state would have to be used because "good...does not 
necessarily mean that the certificate was ever issued".

(But since the CABForum have decided to disallow "good" for non-issued 
certs, I conclude that CABForum-compliant CAs simply cannot use a signed 
OCSP Response at all for non-issued certs.  They'll have to use the 
unsigned "unauthorized" Response instead, as per the (extended) 
definition in RFC5019 Section 2.2.3).

Yes, but what do you want to achieve, as a responder? If you want to make
the client reject the certificate you really have to answer "revoked". If
you answer "unknown", a lot of clients will have the option to fall back to
some other source of revocation information, be it CRLs or another OCSP
responder. And then you have a security problem. Better to answer something
safe from the responder.

Also, I think it wouldn't be compliant to answer "unknown". If you know the
certificate hasn't been issued, you know about the certificate (viz. the
property that it wasn't issued), which clearly contradicts the wording in
the RFC.

I don't agree that using revoked would be clearly wrong. What is wrong is
the current wording of "revoked", which is not aligned with the wording of
"good". If you clarify/correct the wording of the "revoked" definition
according to my suggestion you would not change anything for clients who
don't understand the extension, and you would also preserve the possibility
of redundancy at the protocol level for PKIs that need it (and while it
might be use case of limited application there definitely are those out
there that require it).

The extension would of course only be needed if the client cared about why
he shouldn't accept the certificate.

Also, I think the use of certificate-hold to signal not-issued aligns quite
well. Both are conditions that can change in the future so that the
certificate becomes valid for use. So while it could seem odd that a
certificate that hasn't been issued is already a kind of revoked I think
that is only about labels not about actual semantics.

I think we should write in the RFC what the client is expected to do in
each case:
"good" it MAY accept the certificate
"revoked" it SHOULD reject the certificate
"unknown" it may try some  other revocation source (as defined by whatever
policy you have), or try again later if it has the possibility, failing
that it SHOULD reject the certificate

>From an OCSP responder's perspective this sounds quite logical to me.
If the OCSP responder has been handed a positive list, and the requested
cert is not on that lists, then the OCSP responder simply "does not know"
about that certificate.

In theory, that certificate may have been issued but has not yet made it
to the positive list. Perhaps that certificate has been issued ahead of
it's validity period and will not make it to the positive list until it
does.

An interesting question is what would happen if an "unknown" response was
sent.

Simon,

I thin you have a point here.
I could definitely see the security advantage of declaring the case when th=
e
CA knows the certificate to never have been issued to reply "revoked".

I guess this could be clarified in the text of 2560bis.

Even though I still see some cases where "unknown" could be valid (see
previous mail), I do think you are right in the case when the cert is known
to never have been issued.

My comment was in tended to say that none of the essay responses said that
someone wanted to join you in preparing a different submission, which is my
interpretation of the essence of Henry's question,

I did not reply since:
     - I don't work on Fridays and thus did not see your message until 
Monday.
     - I tallied the straw poll responses and it was clear
       that option A was the winner, by a large margin.

you can post an individual submission.

I agree with Rob with regard to an unsigned  "unauthorized" response.   =
If
certificate status is indeed unknown, then a signed "unknown" seems
appropriate (but illogical where a CA should know whether the =
certificate
was issued -- it should not say "unknown" if it knows the certificate =
was
not issued).  A delegated OCSP responder could respond "unknown".
Otherwise, saying "unknown" would be a lie.  I am very opposed to =
responding
"good" if there is no record of issuance, that is a lie, too.  There are
legal liability issues with misrepresenting the truth -- fraud, =
negligent
misrepresentation, etc.  The fact that it is a technical standard should =
not
be used as an excuse when the response has legal implications - (ala
Lessig's book "Code").   If extensions in this area are needed, then =
they
should be for the "unknown" and "unauthorized" responses.

RFC2560 says:
    The "unknown" state indicates that the responder doesn't know about
    the certificate being requested.

How could "unknown" possibly be the correct response if the responder =
_does
know_ for certain that the "certificate being requested" was never =
issued?

I agree that "revoked" is clearly wrong, since a certificate must first =
have
been issued before it can be revoked.

So IMHO, the "good" state would have to be used because "good...does not
necessarily mean that the certificate was ever issued".

(But since the CABForum have decided to disallow "good" for non-issued
certs, I conclude that CABForum-compliant CAs simply cannot use a signed
OCSP Response at all for non-issued certs.  They'll have to use the =
unsigned
"unauthorized" Response instead, as per the (extended) definition in =
RFC5019
Section 2.2.3).

In RFC2560, "good" is just a label, and the definition of the label 
clearly says...

    The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.
    At a minimum, this positive response indicates that the certificate
    is not revoked, but does not necessarily mean that the certificate
    was ever issued...

Maybe it was a bad choice of label name.  Maybe it was a bad design 
decision to omit proof of (non-)issuance from the core protocol.

But I fail to see how RFC2560's definition of the "good" label 
misrepresents the truth.

I agree -- I don't think we should redefine OCSP semantics now.  I
believe we should only do editorial fixes to resolve ambiguities and
bugs.  Stefan's initial proposed text does, I believe, redefine
semantics, so I would be against it.  Members of CAB forum can address
their concern by publishing a OCSP profile that they promise to follow.

Rob,

The citation you provided has been  truncated. What is important is the=20
end of the text.
Hereafter is the full text:

   The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.
   At a minimum, this positive response indicates that the certificate
   is not revoked, but does not necessarily mean that the certificate
   was ever issued or that the time at which the response was produced
   is within the certificate's validity interval. Response extensions
   may be used to convey additional information on assertions made by
   the responder regarding the status of the certificate such as
   positive statement about issuance, validity, etc.

If the certificate was never issued and if the OCSP responder is using=20
only CRLs, it will return good.

If the certificate was never issued and if  the OCSP responder knows that=20
the certificate was never issued,=20
it will also return "good", but MAY use a single response extension to=20
convey additional information such as=20
a positive statement about issuance.

So, the status should be "good" (and not revoked, nor unknown).

The question is whether we should take the opportunity of the revision of=20
RFC 2560 to define=20
such a single extension, or leave the definition of such an extension to=20
the CAB forum ?
.
Denis

In RFC2560, "good" is just a label, and the definition of the label=20
clearly says...

    The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.
    At a minimum, this positive response indicates that the certificate
    is not revoked, but does not necessarily mean that the certificate
    was ever issued...

Maybe it was a bad choice of label name.  Maybe it was a bad design=20
decision to omit proof of (non-)issuance from the core protocol.

But I fail to see how RFC2560's definition of the "good" label=20
misrepresents the truth.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts director=
ies.
 This draft is a work item of the Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) Working=
 Group of the IETF.

	Title           : Updates to the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure =
Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile
	Author(s)       : Peter E. Yee
	Filename        : draft-ietf-pkix-rfc5280-clarifications-07.txt
	Pages           : 8
	Date            : 2012-08-15

Abstract:
   This document updates RFC 5280, the Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   Profile.  This document changes the set of acceptable encoding
   methods for the explicitText field of the user notice policy
   qualifier and clarifies the rules for converting internationalized
   domain name labels to ASCII.  This document also provides some
   clarifications on the use of self-signed certificates, trust anchors,
   and some updated security considerations.

As a separate issue I wish we would include some of T. Miller's =

I'm oversimplifying, but basically there are only ever two responses =
that a responder can give:  if it has a CRL it can say "revoked" or =
"unknown" (IMO it would be bad practice to say "good", though the =
current spec implies you should say "good" instead of "unknown").  If it =
has a white-list, it can say "good" or "unknown".  (While the spec might =
allow it, I think it would be silly to respond "good" for a cert not on =
the white list. ;-) =20

The only way I see to justify three responses is if the responder has =
both a black and a white list.  The only way I see for an OCSP responder =
to provide useful actionable information is if we change something so a =
client can consistently interpret and act on the responses, regardless =
of what kind of information the OCSP responder is using.

If we don't want to change the base definition of "good" so it actually =
means on-the-white-list, OK.  We can define a "really good" extension, =
like Denis says.  In that case I don't see any useful distinction =
between "good" (but not "really good") and "unknown".

In RFC2560, "good" is just a label, and the definition of the label=20
clearly says...

   The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.
   At a minimum, this positive response indicates that the certificate
   is not revoked, but does not necessarily mean that the certificate
   was ever issued...

Maybe it was a bad choice of label name.  Maybe it was a bad design=20
decision to omit proof of (non-)issuance from the core protocol.

But I fail to see how RFC2560's definition of the "good" label=20
misrepresents the truth.

> I'm oversimplifying, but basically there are only ever two responses that a responder can give:  if it has a CRL it can say "revoked" or "unknown" (IMO it would be bad practice to say "good", though the current spec implies you should say "good" instead of "unknown").  If it has a white-list, it can say "good" or "unknown".  (While the spec might allow it, I think it would be silly to respond "good" for a cert not on the white list. ;-)

By this logic, the only response a responder can give is "unknown," 
unless the request includes a (yet to be defined) extension that 
includes a copy of the certificate or a hash of the certificate. Since 
the request only includes hashes of the issuer's name and public key and 
the serial number of the certificate, even if the responder has a white 
list, the responder cannot know whether the requester is referring to 
the certificate on the white list or to a different certificate that 
just happens to have the same issuer name and serial number, and that 
has been signed by the same key (or that at least appears to have been 
signed by the same key).  So, I guess that until a new request extension 
has been defined it would be "silly" for a responder to ever give a 
response other than "unknown."

> The only way I see to justify three responses is if the responder has both a black and a white list.

It is very easy to justify three responses as long as you accept that 
OCSP is a certificate status responder and not a validation server.  A 
response from an OCSP responder, by itself, it useless. The OCSP 
response only serves to help perform Step (a)(3) in Section 6.1.3 of the 
path validation algorithm in RFC 5280 (i.e., verify that the certificate 
is not revoked).

Since the labels that are assigned to the three possible responses from 
the OCSP responder seem to object to the use of one particular response 
in the case of a certificate that has not been revoked, but for which 
the responder does not have sufficient information to ensure was issued, 
let's refer to the responses as (A), (B), and (C).

1.  A response of (A) indicates that the responder knows that the 
specified certificate has not been revoked (whether it was ever issued 
or not).  This means that the certificate satisfies the condition 
specified in Step (a)(3) in Section 6.1.3 of the path validation 
algorithm (i.e., it is not revoked).

2. A response of (B) indicates that the responder knows that the 
specified certificate has been revoked.  This means that the certificate 
does not satisfy the condition specified in Step (a)(3) in Section 6.1.3 
of the path validation algorithm, which triggers the following:

    If any of steps (a), (b), (c), or (f) fails, the procedure
    terminates, returning a failure indication and an appropriate reason.

3. A response of (C) indicates that the responder does not know the 
status of the certificate.  In this case the client may try another way 
to verify that the certificate has not been revoked (e.g., ask a 
different responder or obtain a CRL).  [If the client is unable to 
verify the certificate's revocation status by another means, then it 
will either have to reject the certificate or make a risk-based decision 
to accept the certificate despite being unable to verify that it is not 
revoked.]

I would guess that a response of (C) is most likely to occur in the case 
of a locally trusted OCSP responder.  My client may be configured to ask 
the locally configured OCSP responder first, and then if the response is 
(C) attempt to determine the certificate's status by using an OCSP 
responder referenced in the AIA extension in the certificate or by using 
a CRL obtained via the CDP extension in the certificate.

> The only way I see for an OCSP responder to provide useful actionable information is if we change something so a client can consistently interpret and act on the responses, regardless of what kind of information the OCSP responder is using.

As noted above, the current protocol already allows an OCSP responder to 
provide "useful actionable information."   Of course, clients won't be 
able to consistently interpret and act on responses if responders apply 
their own (personal) interpretations to the three possible status 
responses.  If some developers decide that it is "silly" for a responder 
to provide a response of (A) unless working from a white list and so 
have their responders provide a response of (C) for any certificate 
isn't known to be revoked, then clients will no longer have "useful 
actionable information."  This may not matter for some clients if they 
are configured to ask the OCSP responder about the certificate, but then 
continue on with validation unless a response of (B) is received (i.e., 
if all other aspects of path validation are successful, then accept the 
certificate even if no response is received from the OCSP responder or 
if a response of (A), (C), or even a error response is received).  
However, it will make a big difference to any client configured to fail 
safe by failing path validation unless it can actually verify that the 
certificate is not revoked.

What would it take to get clients to hash the certificate, send the hash as
part of the OCSP request, and get responders to respond accordingly?

Whether you call the responses Good, Revoked and Unknown, OR; A, B and =
C,
OR; Alice, Bob and Charlie, the RFC is logically flawed in that Good, by
containing, "...but does not necessarily mean that the certificate was =
ever
issued..." overlaps status Unknown.  As long as that is the case
implementations will be flawed and confused.

And since the response is in fact called 'Good' and not 'A', and not
'Alice', a response of 'Good' for an unissued certificate may not, as =
Rob
has pointed out, misrepresent the truth as per the definition provided =
in
the RFC, but it most certainly does misrepresent the truth in terms of =
what
most people understand the word and concept of 'Good' to mean.

RFC2560 defined only 3 response types:  "good", "revoked", "unknown",
where what is currently described covers only a fraction of what is
actually possible.

One of the purposes of OCSP, as defined by rfc2560, is a protocol to
outsource CRL checking.  The elaborate explanation for "good" is only
proof of how lousy CRLs are in the first place, because you really
don't know much at all.

It seems to have never occured to the architects of X.509 that fraudulent
cert issuance could happen, and consumer might appreciate when revocation
checking did at least offer some amount of risk management for certain
aspects of fraudulently issued certs that subvert the design of
CRL-based revocation checking (such as multiple certs from the same CA with
the same serial number or certs for which records of issuance were destroyed,
so that the CA is not (no longer) aware these certs have been issued).


For the way forward, the original description is much less important
than the behaviour of the installed base to each of the three responses,
and the intention of the CA, which RP behaviour does it want to induce.


If a CA runs an OCSP server with access to the cert issue records or the
certs database, then this CA might want to send OCSP responses
"revoked (on hold)" for all requests about certs that it can not positively
identify to have issued.

This is not possible for running an OCSP server with a newly invented,
periodically issued whitelist of existing certs, unless you're OK with
declaring all newly issued certs "revoked (on hold)" as well, until the
whitelist update covering the newly issued cert is complete.


The "unknown" status looks pretty useless to me for the purpose of
conveying "does not exist" status, because it will probably
cause RPs in the installed base to perform CRL checking (which is also pure
blacklisting), so that extra overhead is likely not going to lead to a better
result, but will typically cause additional network round trips and
repeat of processing that the OCSP server already did
(but could not convey with the 3-state response "good", "revoked", "unknown").

Rich,

There is indeed a solution which uses the current text of RFC 2560,=20
without the need to tweak any current meaning=20
of "good", "revoked" or "unknown".

The solution allows all current OCSP clients (if they comply with RFC=20
2560) to reject the target certificate.

The solution allows "new" OCSP clients, compliant of the solution, to know =

that a white list of certificates=20
has been used by the OCSP server and that the target serial number is=20
unknown in that list.

In order to provide everybody with the opportunity to find the solution by =

himself, I will post additional  information=20
a little bit later in another post, as a reply to Henry B. Hotz.

:-)

Whether you call the responses Good, Revoked and Unknown, OR; A, B and C,
OR; Alice, Bob and Charlie, the RFC is logically flawed in that Good, by
containing, "...but does not necessarily mean that the certificate was=20
ever
issued..." overlaps status Unknown.  As long as that is the case
implementations will be flawed and confused.

And since the response is in fact called 'Good' and not 'A', and not
'Alice', a response of 'Good' for an unissued certificate may not, as Rob
has pointed out, misrepresent the truth as per the definition provided in
the RFC, but it most certainly does misrepresent the truth in terms of=20
what
most people understand the word and concept of 'Good' to mean.

&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I'm oversimplifying, but basically there are only ever two respon=
ses<br>
&gt; &gt; that a responder can give: &nbsp;if it has a CRL it can say &quot=
;revoked&quot;
or<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;unknown&quot; (IMO it would be bad practice to say &quot;go=
od&quot;,
though the<br>
&gt; &gt; current spec implies you should say &quot;good&quot; instead
of &quot;unknown&quot;). &nbsp;If<br>
&gt; &gt; it has a white-list, it can say &quot;good&quot; or &quot;unknown=
&quot;.
&nbsp;(While the spec<br>
&gt; &gt; might allow it, I think it would be silly to respond &quot;good&q=
uot;
for a<br>
&gt; cert<br>
&gt; &gt; not on the white list. ;-)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; By this logic, the only response a responder can give is &quot;unknown=
,&quot;<br>
&gt; unless the request includes a (yet to be defined) extension that<br>
&gt; includes a copy of the certificate or a hash of the certificate. Since=
<br>
&gt; the request only includes hashes of the issuer's name and public key<b=
r>
&gt; and the serial number of the certificate, even if the responder has
a<br>
&gt; white list, the responder cannot know whether the requester is<br>
&gt; referring to the certificate on the white list or to a different<br>
&gt; certificate that just happens to have the same issuer name and serial<=
br>
&gt; number, and that has been signed by the same key (or that at least<br>
&gt; appears to have been signed by the same key). &nbsp;So, I guess that
until a<br>
&gt; new request extension has been defined it would be &quot;silly&quot;
for a<br>
&gt; responder to ever give a response other than &quot;unknown.&quot;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The only way I see to justify three responses is if the responder
has<br>
&gt; both a black and a white list.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It is very easy to justify three responses as long as you accept that<=
br>
&gt; OCSP is a certificate status responder and not a validation server.
&nbsp;A<br>
&gt; response from an OCSP responder, by itself, it useless. The OCSP<br>
&gt; response only serves to help perform Step (a)(3) in Section 6.1.3
of<br>
&gt; the path validation algorithm in RFC 5280 (i.e., verify that the<br>
&gt; certificate is not revoked).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Since the labels that are assigned to the three possible responses
from<br>
&gt; the OCSP responder seem to object to the use of one particular respons=
e<br>
&gt; in the case of a certificate that has not been revoked, but for which<=
br>
&gt; the responder does not have sufficient information to ensure was<br>
&gt; issued, let's refer to the responses as (A), (B), and (C).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. &nbsp;A response of (A) indicates that the responder knows that
the<br>
&gt; specified certificate has not been revoked (whether it was ever issued=
<br>
&gt; or not). &nbsp;This means that the certificate satisfies the condition=
<br>
&gt; specified in Step (a)(3) in Section 6.1.3 of the path validation<br>
&gt; algorithm (i.e., it is not revoked).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. A response of (B) indicates that the responder knows that the<br>
&gt; specified certificate has been revoked. &nbsp;This means that the<br>
&gt; certificate does not satisfy the condition specified in Step (a)(3)
in<br>
&gt; Section 6.1.3 of the path validation algorithm, which triggers the<br>
&gt; following:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any of steps (a), (b), (c), or (f) fails, the procedu=
re<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; terminates, returning a failure indication and an approp=
riate<br>
&gt; reason.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 3. A response of (C) indicates that the responder does not know the<br>
&gt; status of the certificate. &nbsp;In this case the client may try anoth=
er
way<br>
&gt; to verify that the certificate has not been revoked (e.g., ask a<br>
&gt; different responder or obtain a CRL). &nbsp;[If the client is unable
to<br>
&gt; verify the certificate's revocation status by another means, then
it<br>
&gt; will either have to reject the certificate or make a risk-based<br>
&gt; decision to accept the certificate despite being unable to verify
that<br>
&gt; it is not revoked.]<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I would guess that a response of (C) is most likely to occur in the<br>
&gt; case of a locally trusted OCSP responder. &nbsp;My client may be confi=
gured<br>
&gt; to ask the locally configured OCSP responder first, and then if the<br>
&gt; response is<br>
&gt; (C) attempt to determine the certificate's status by using an OCSP<br>
&gt; responder referenced in the AIA extension in the certificate or by<br>
&gt; using a CRL obtained via the CDP extension in the certificate.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The only way I see for an OCSP responder to provide useful action=
able<br>
&gt; information is if we change something so a client can consistently<br>
&gt; interpret and act on the responses, regardless of what kind of<br>
&gt; information the OCSP responder is using.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As noted above, the current protocol already allows an OCSP responder<=
br>
&gt; to<br>
&gt; provide &quot;useful actionable information.&quot; &nbsp; Of course,
clients won't be<br>
&gt; able to consistently interpret and act on responses if responders
apply<br>
&gt; their own (personal) interpretations to the three possible status<br>
&gt; responses. &nbsp;If some developers decide that it is &quot;silly&quot;
for a<br>
&gt; responder to provide a response of (A) unless working from a white
list<br>
&gt; and so have their responders provide a response of (C) for any<br>
&gt; certificate isn't known to be revoked, then clients will no longer
have<br>
&gt; &quot;useful actionable information.&quot; &nbsp;This may not matter
for some clients<br>

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts director=
ies.
 This draft is a work item of the Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) Working=
 Group of the IETF.

	Title           : Updates to the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure =
Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile
	Author(s)       : Peter E. Yee
	Filename        : draft-ietf-pkix-rfc5280-clarifications-08.txt

Abstract:
   This document updates RFC 5280, the Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   Profile.  This document changes the set of acceptable encoding
   methods for the explicitText field of the user notice policy
   qualifier and clarifies the rules for converting internationalized
   domain name labels to ASCII.  This document also provides some
   clarifications on the use of self-signed certificates, trust anchors,
   and some updated security considerations.

Follow up of the previous mail on the same topic.

There is a solution which does not use any extension in the request.

This solution uses a new singleResponse extension, which indicates that=20
the serial number of the certificate is not present=20
in the list of the certificates issued by the CA to which the OCSP=20
responder has access.

When this extension contains that indication, the critical flag SHALL be=20
set.

OCSP clients unable to process this singleResponse extension SHALL=20
consider that the content of the single response=20
cannot be interpreted (this is the usual way to process an extension that=20
is marked critical) and this leads to an error=20
case (e.g. single response content invalid).

Clients able to process this singleResponse extension will know that the=20
serial number of the certificate is not present=20
in the list of the certificates issued by the CA to which the OCSP=20
responder has access.

Perhaps you're trying to tweak me, but I think I agree with you.  ;-)

Uh-oh!

If the OCSP requestor does not indicate that it supports new response
semantics, then the OCSP responder can not distinguish rfc2560 clients
from updated clients!

The prerequisite for any negotiation of new features is that
the requst contains an indication about the clients additional
capabilities.  Without it, the server should not be _extremely_
conservative about changes in the response.

Now that looks quite dangerous to me.  A client that did not indicate
to understand the extension is indistinguishable from an simple
rfc2560 client.  And the simple rfc2560 should drop the OCSP response
with an unrecognized critical extension.  Which will either result
in the client to skip OCSP checking (bad) or to try other responders
or CRLs (also bad).


What the (CAs) OCSP responder should answer depends on what the OCSP
responder wants the client/RP to do.  If the OCSP responder wants
the client/RP to *NOT* trust that cert, then "revoked (on hold)" is
the only sensible response.

If the OCSP responder wants to include this information only for those
(new/updated) clients/RP that care about this info, then "good" with
a non-critical extension would be OK.

"unknown" implies that the client/RP should ask someone else,
and a non-marginal number of client/RPs might skip the revocation
check when receiving an unknown response (treating it similar
to a network connection failure to the OCSP responder).

This leads to the client/RP either skipping revocation or
falling back to CRL checking--where the "not issued" state can
not be conveyed at all.  I consider this behaviour non-sensical
with respect to the installed base.

Client/RPs do not want to know that.  They instead want to know
"can I trust this cert"?  An OCSP server that says "This cert may have
not been issued" rather than "Do NOT trust this cert" is chickening out.


In order to make a whitelist check reasonably foolproof, the client/RP
should send either the whole cert or at least the certificate(!) hash
and the validity of the certificate in the OCSP request.

The whitelist lookup should be performed with the certificate hash,
and the validity enables an OCSP responder to determine whether the
whitelist records it has access to are sufficiently "fresh" to
determine whether the cert in question has been issued.

I agree with this completely, including hash lookups.

Trying to map blacklist and whitelist information is not what the client is
interested in.  It's very rare that a responder should say "I can't
assertively speak for this certificate, go elsewhere." The responder should
be giving "trust this" or "don't trust this".

A new non-working group mailing list has been created and subscription 
information can be found at:

https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/wpkops

The purpose of the mailing list is to discussion the following topics:

- How the Web PKI currently works
- Shortcomings and failure modes of the current Web PKI
- Future evolution of Web PKI
- Advice to those developing Web PKI clients

If you were at the SAAG session at IETF 84 [1], you might remember that 
we talked about having a BoF at IETF 85 to consider formation of a 
Working Group on one or more of these topics.  For that reason, 
discussion in the immediate future should probably focus on the scope 
and objectives of such a Working Group.

Uh-oh!

If the OCSP requestor does not indicate that it supports new response
semantics, then the OCSP responder can not distinguish rfc2560 clients
from updated clients!

The prerequisite for any negotiation of new features is that
the request contains an indication about the clients additional
capabilities.  Without it, the server should not be _extremely_
conservative about changes in the response.

[Denis: No. The solution does not need any change in the request]

Now that looks quite dangerous to me.  A client that did not indicate
to understand the extension is indistinguishable from an simple
rfc2560 client.  And the simple rfc2560 should drop the OCSP response
with an unrecognized critical extension.  Which will either result
in the client to skip OCSP checking (bad) or to try other responders
or CRLs (also bad).

[Denis: An OCSP client which does not recognize a critical extension 
within singleExtensions SHALL drop the individual response where that 
critical extension is present but may accept other responses within 
the field responses"]

What the (CAs) OCSP responder should answer depends on what the OCSP
responder wants the client/RP to do.  If the OCSP responder wants
the client/RP to *NOT* trust that cert, then "revoked (on hold)" is
the only sensible response.

[Denis: Again, if a critical extension is present within singleExtensions 
in an individual response then the client SHALL drop the individual 
response 
whatever the value of CertStatus may be. So it is irrelevant to argue 
about the value of the CertStatus] 

If the OCSP responder wants to include this information only for those
(new/updated) clients/RP that care about this info, then "good" with
a non-critical extension would be OK.

[Denis: No. See above]

"unknown" implies that the client/RP should ask someone else,
and a non-marginal number of client/RPs might skip the revocation
check when receiving an unknown response (treating it similar
to a network connection failure to the OCSP responder).

[Denis: No. See above]

This leads to the client/RP either skipping revocation or
falling back to CRL checking--where the "not issued" state can
not be conveyed at all.  I consider this behaviour non-sensical
with respect to the installed base.

[Denis: Compliant clients shall not skip revocation as you say. 
However, your second argument is a valid consideration. I am preparing 
a draft for the definition of a new extension within singleExtensions 
and I have added the following note:

   NOTE: OCSP clients should not use a fallback mechanism based on CRLs 
         when they encounter within singleExtensions an extension which 
         is not understood and which is marked critical.]
 
> Clients able to process this singleResponse extension will know that the

Client/RPs do not want to know that.  They instead want to know
"can I trust this cert"?  An OCSP server that says "This cert may have
not been issued" rather than "Do NOT trust this cert" is chickening out.

In order to make a whitelist check reasonably foolproof, the client/RP
should send either the whole cert or at least the certificate(!) hash
and the validity of the certificate in the OCSP request.

[Denis: In the draft I am preparing, the server may return the hash. 
So you get the same property, but without the need to change the syntax 
of the request. Note: the client may not know in advance whether the 
server 
is using or not white lists]

The whitelist lookup should be performed with the certificate hash,
and the validity enables an OCSP responder to determine whether the
whitelist records it has access to are sufficiently "fresh" to
determine whether the cert in question has been issued.

[Denis: returning the hash provides the same benefit. The comparison 
will be done by the client rather than by the server].

<br>
<hr noshade>
<br><tt><font size=2><br>
&gt; Follow up of the previous mail on the same topic.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There is a solution which does not use any extension in the request.<br>
<br>
Uh-oh!<br>
<br>
If the OCSP requestor does not indicate that it supports new response<br>
semantics, then the OCSP responder can not distinguish rfc2560 clients<br>
from updated clients!<br>
<br>
The prerequisite for any negotiation of new features is that<br>
the request contains an indication about the clients additional<br>
capabilities. &nbsp;Without it, the server should not be _extremely_<br>
conservative about changes in the response.<br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2><b>[Denis: No. The solution does not need any change
in the request]</b><br>
<br>
&gt; This solution uses a new singleResponse extension, which indicates
that <br>
&gt; the serial number of the certificate is not present <br>
&gt; in the list of the certificates issued by the CA to which the OCSP
<br>
&gt; responder has access.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When this extension contains that indication, the critical flag SHALL
be <br>
&gt; set.<br>
<br>
Now that looks quite dangerous to me. &nbsp;A client that did not indicate<br>
to understand the extension is indistinguishable from an simple<br>
rfc2560 client. &nbsp;And the simple rfc2560 should drop the OCSP response<br>
with an unrecognized critical extension. &nbsp;Which will either result<br>
in the client to skip OCSP checking (bad) or to try other responders<br>
or CRLs (also bad).<br>
</font></tt>
<br><font size=2 face="Courier New"><b>[Denis: An OCSP client which does

Of course some organizations have already started using extensions like 
some things discussed here.

I'm pretty sure some of you are familiar with the german Common PKI. 
They have an OCSP extension (non critical):

-----
Common PKI Profile: This Common PKI-specification defines the private 
single response extension CertHash that may deliver a positive statement 
about the availability
of a certificate.

(oid 1.3.36.8.3.13)

SingleResponse extension: the responder may include this --
extension in a response to send the hash of the requested
certificate to the requestor. This hash serves as evidence that
the certificate is known to the responder (i.e. it is available in
the queried directory) and will be used as means to provide a
positive statement of availability.
-----

While I am usually fiercly against extending standard protocols, this 
seems like one of the simplest ways to inform the client with extra 
information about what exactly is included in the "good" response.

CAB Forum could use this possible information in a number of ways, 
including requiring that EV CAs include this or the cert will be rejected.

The client is the end point enforcing a specific policy, and it seems to 
me that most OCSP consuming systems do not have a lot of random clients 
that interpret the responders responses in very different ways.
For the browser world CAB Forum should be able to profile OCSP as to not 
require large changes to the spec.

Cheers,
Tomas

Tomas,

Thank you for the information,

However, this extension does not help if the OCSP client does not=20
understand it,=20
since it is a non critical extension.

I am preparing a draft for an extension which provides benefits in both=20
situations,=20
i.e. whether the OCSP client understands it or whether it does not.=20
Of course, the benefits are exactly not the same.

Denis

Of course some organizations have already started using extensions like
<br>
some things discussed here.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure some of you are familiar with the german Common PKI. <br>
They have an OCSP extension (non critical):<br>
<br>
-----<br>
Common PKI Profile: This Common PKI-specification defines the private <br>
single response extension CertHash that may deliver a positive statement
<br>
about the availability<br>
of a certificate.<br>
<br>
(oid 1.3.36.8.3.13)<br>
<br>
SingleResponse extension: the responder may include this --<br>
extension in a response to send the hash of the requested<br>
certificate to the requestor. This hash serves as evidence that<br>
the certificate is known to the responder (i.e. it is available in<br>
the queried directory) and will be used as means to provide a<br>
positive statement of availability.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
While I am usually fiercly against extending standard protocols, this <br>
seems like one of the simplest ways to inform the client with extra <br>
information about what exactly is included in the &quot;good&quot; response=
.<br>
<br>
CAB Forum could use this possible information in a number of ways, <br>
including requiring that EV CAs include this or the cert will be rejected.<=
br>
<br>
The client is the end point enforcing a specific policy, and it seems to
<br>
me that most OCSP consuming systems do not have a lot of random clients
<br>
that interpret the responders responses in very different ways.<br>
For the browser world CAB Forum should be able to profile OCSP as to not
<br>
require large changes to the spec.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; Follow up of the previous mail on the same topic.<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; There is a solution which does not use any extension in
the request.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Uh-oh!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If the OCSP requestor does not indicate that it supports new response<=
br>
&gt; semantics, then the OCSP responder can not distinguish rfc2560 clients=
<br>
&gt; from updated clients!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The prerequisite for any negotiation of new features is that<br>
&gt; the request contains an indication about the clients additional<br>
&gt; capabilities. &nbsp;Without it, the server should not be =5Fextremely=
=5F<br>
&gt; conservative about changes in the response.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; *[Denis: No. The solution does not need any change in the request]*<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; This solution uses a new singleResponse extension, which
indicates that<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; the serial number of the certificate is not present<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; in the list of the certificates issued by the CA to which
the OCSP<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; responder has access.<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; When this extension contains that indication, the critical
flag SHALL be<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; set.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Now that looks quite dangerous to me. &nbsp;A client that did not
indicate<br>
&gt; to understand the extension is indistinguishable from an simple<br>
&gt; rfc2560 client. &nbsp;And the simple rfc2560 should drop the OCSP
response<br>
&gt; with an unrecognized critical extension. &nbsp;Which will either resul=
t<br>
&gt; in the client to skip OCSP checking (bad) or to try other responders<b=

&gt; or CRLs (also bad).<br>

&gt;<br>

Oh yes, you do.  That requirement is described in rfc2560 section 4.4.3.

  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560#section-4.4.3

An OCSP server is not allowed to return something other than a
basic ocsp response unless the client has included a requestExtension
that indicates that the client recognizes other than id-pkix-ocsp-basic.

I would not be surprised if a client that obtains a response for
an request about a singular cert would drop the entire response if
it contained an unexpected (=non-negotiated) critical responseExtension
in the first single response.

I would consider it strange if an OCSP response about a singular
cert contains multiple single repsonses about the exact same cert
with different properties (one with a critical extension, and one
without a critical extension).  Since there is no specific ordering
defined for processing multiple single responses for one singular cert
in rfc2560, a response with multiple responses for a singular cert
would be a clear violation of the protocol defined rfc2560.

You can not change behaviour of the installed base by adding a note
to a protocol update.  The only thing you can reliably affect is
the behaviour of *NEW* implementations, and a hard-to-predict
subset of the installed base when it is patched.

As someone regular doing customer support, I strongly dislike the reverse
approach.

This is an issue where it would be quite sensible to require the client
to send the certificate hash, so that the CA can detect when there is
a problem, and CA helpdesk has access to that information when the
cert hash mismatch leads to clients/RPs failing authentication--rather
than having to jump hoops in order to trace arbitrary third-party software
for reasons why it keeps failing cert revocation checks.

The client can use the best/strongest hash available, whereas the
server would have to use the weakest (when the client did not convey
anything through extensions about its capabilities.

I don't think what we actually do here matters at all provided that
(1) we all interpret the same signals to mean the same thing and (2)
we can actually distinguish between the status situations that require
it.

The fact that OCSP does not distinguish 'good' from 'utterly bad' has
turned out to be a very bad thing in practice.


One problem here is that OCSP was saddled with being both an
authoritative status protocol and a non-authoritative one without the
use cases for either being adequately considered let alone separated.

What is in the specification does not really worry me a whole lot at
this point. What I personally care about is what the code that is out
there in the wild does.


It seems to me to be completely sensible for an authoritative  OCSP
responder to report status as follows:

Good: I know that this is good
Revoked: This was once good but now is bad
Unknown: This is so bad I ain't ever heard of it.

Likewise it seems completely sensible for a non-authoritative OCSP
responder to report status as

Good: I have CRLs for that issuer and it is not on it
Revoked: It is on the CRL for that issuer I have
Unknown: I do not have a CRL for that issuer.


These seem to be completely separate semantics that have been
unfortunately merged into one spec in a bad fashion.

How does the client know that the responder is authoritative or not?
Well how did it decide to send the query there in the first place? If
the responder was found by following a URL in the cert then it is
authoritative. Otherwise the responder must have been configured out
of band and that configuration should have the necessary information.
An authoritative response should hopefully have some common connection
to the trust anchor for the cert,


The question is how we get from where we are now to where we want to
be given the deployed infrastructure. If the criticality flag hack
proposed by Denis turns out to be more backwards compatible then we
should probably do that, if it turns out that real deployed clients
treat an OCSP token with a criticality flag as 'accept the cert' then
we should not.

In any case I think we really do need to have a set of extensions to
OCSP that allow a CA to state with clarity:

1) This OCSP response purports to be from the authoritative provider
of status for that cert
2) Which specific certificate the response refers to
3) Whether the certificate was issued and if issued what its status is

The fact that we appear to be having difficulty with all three points
here does not lead me to conclude 'do what the spec says regardless of
whether it makes sense'.

The originial protocol failed to recognized (from the discussion of
"good" in rfc2560 section 2.2) that there is a need for bad status
codes besides revoked.  But by lacking to define other states from the
start, the only reasonable way forward is to use "revoked" to convey
all variations of known "bad", and to sort out the details through extensions.

It seems silly to have an OCSP responder label a known "bad" certificate
"good" or likewise to chicken out with an "unknown" reply, which will cause
RPs to ignore the result or fallback to CRL checking (and the latter
will result in a "good" classification of "bad" states that a CRL can
not represent).

A "fallback to other OCSP server" would be even more silly, because
if the other OCSP server would return "good" or "bad", then the first
OCSP server should have provided this answer in the first place.
And if the other OCSP server also provides "unknown", then it is
an obvious waste of resources, ultimately ending in the RP attempting
CRL-checking (with a result of "good"), or skipping revocation checking
entirely.


Adding situations where OCSP-based revocation will fail to provide an
answer (i.e. "unknown" rather than "good" or "bad/revoked") will make
hard fail clients/RP further unlikely.

Authoritative is exclusively indicated by rfc2560 section 4.2.2.2
items (2) and (3).


  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560#section-4.2.2.2

   2. Is the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate in
   question; or

   3. Includes a value of id-ad-ocspSigning in an ExtendedKeyUsage
   extension and is issued by the CA that issued the certificate in
   question."


>

Ouch.  The "common trust anchor" is a security vulerability in the
definition of authorized CRL signers!  rfc2560 originally does not
have this vulnerability, and I strongly opposed to drilling the CRL
security hole into the OCSP spec.

Strong disagree.  It is *completely* irrelevant how the OCSP response was
actually obtained (from cache, stapled in a TLS extension, out-of-band,
proxied by a local OCSP responder, etc.).

But looking only at the behaviour of the well-known browser vendors
would be short-sighted.  The question is: which of the well-defined
behaviour (per rfc2560) works in a predictable fashion in the installed
base. 

The behaviour resulting from an "unknown" response of the OCSP responder
is de-facto undefined.

That latter unkown state does not exist in rfc2560.

The end of rfc2560, section 2.2 Response says exactly this:

   The "unknown" state indicates that the responder doesn't know about
   the certificate being requested.

Which means that the "unknown" response clearly means that the OCSP
server does either not know about the status or does not want to
answer, with the effective meaning of "Don't ask ME, ask someone else."

It certainly does NOT say "worse than revoked".

Where does rfc2560 _limit_ the information source for the answers of
non-authoritative OCSP responders to CRLs?  The description for the
"good" state is very explicit that OCSP responders may work on other
information resources besides CRLs.  (there would not be much of an
extensibility, if it didn't).

It is completely out-of-scope for PKIX/rfc5280 how to handle
a locally trusted OCSP responder cert that is a self-signed non-CA cert
with respect to validating that cert, revoking such a cert and
(re-)distributing an update to such a cert.

I believe that creating an example, which is out-of-scope for PKIX
in so many ways, to be a bad idea in general.

Personally, I believe that a local OCSP responder is an idea that is
not well thought out, because it does not appear to fit with PKIX
(in-scope) protocol features at all.

How to identify whether a signer is a "trusted local OCSP signer",
and how to configure for which CAs it is trusted to provide
revocation info looks quite complicated to me.  Is it documented
somewhere how you would configure this for e.g. Microsoft Windows?

This just seems to be a long-winded way of saying that you don't have a 
good example of a locally trusted OCSP responder because you don't like 
the idea.

Well, whether you like it or not, locally trusted OCSP responders are 
explicitly permitted by RFC 2560.  I also totally disagree with your 
implication that it is unacceptable to include an example of a locally 
trusted OCSP responder in which the responder's key is distributed in 
the form of a self-signed certificate.  The 5280 update document states 
that self-signed certificates that are issued by other than CAs are 
outside the scope of RFC 5280 (not PKIX).  It does not say that such 
certificates cannot be used as an example in a PKIX document.

Furthermore, the example that you disagree with does not specify "how to 
handle" the self-signed certificate, it simply indicates in the figure 
that the responder's public key appears in a self-signed certificate.  
Neither does the example provide any details about how to configure a 
client to work with a locally trusted OCSP responder.

I'm not aware of any reasonable local OCSP responder scenario, any
I have serious doubts that it exists at all.  Prove me wrong.

I agree that they're mentioned.  But they're so extremely underspecified,
that I violently disagree that rfc2560 supports "local OCSP responders"
in any remotely meaningful fashion (read: in a fashion that allows
independent interoperable implementations).

rfc2560 contains a paragraph that is extremely explicit that it might
be dangerous to have an OCSP signer cert for ONE SINGLE CA that is
non-revocable:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560#section-4.2.2.2.1

   - A CA may specify that an OCSP client can trust a responder for the
   lifetime of the responder's certificate. The CA does so by including
   the extension id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck. This SHOULD be a non-critical
   extension. The value of the extension should be NULL. CAs issuing
   such a certificate should realized that a compromise of the
   responder's key, is as serious as the compromise of a CA key used to
   sign CRLs, at least for the validity period of this certificate. CA's
   may choose to issue this type of certificate with a very short
   lifetime and renew it frequently.

a self-signed local OCSP signer cert is a non-revocable, lifetime-unlimited,
OCSP signer cert valid for *ALL* CAs.  On my scorecards, this makes it the
most irresponsible fashion to configure rfc2560, because it is the
most extreme opposite of what is suggested in the paragraph quoted above.


Therefore I'm stronly opposed to add to the spec an example of a local OCSP
responder using a self-signed non-CA cert.

I'm unfamiliar to the definition of the term "PKIX" that you're using.

Self-signed certificates from non-CA entities are outside of scope
for both, ITU-T X.509 and the "PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile"

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-3

   Following is a simplified view of the architectural model assumed by
   the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) specifications.

I'm sorry, but I find it somewhat strange that an example description
for how to use an OCSP protocol feature for PKIX is completely out
of scope for PKIX.  Either there is a way to create a reasonable,
comparatively simple and fully in-scope example usage for a local
OCSP responder, or that feature should be pruned from the protocol.

That is what is _supposed_ to happen when a document progresses on
the maturity level of IETF standards.

an application delegates all validation to a
dedicated validation authority which is managed
by a security staff. a local ocsp responder implements
company wide or personal trust policies and allows to
manage them independently from applications.

+1.

Doesn't corporate IT staff retain (at least in principle) the authority to =
accept OS and application updates from manufacturers, vet them for compatib=
ility with the local environment, and only then push them to the desktop?  =
In some cases it may just be a rubber stamp (who has the time to keep up wi=

The PKI is responsible for supporting authentication; the local enterprise =
is responsible for authorization.  In cases where the authorization infrast=
ructure is immature or nonexistent, local managers may wish to revoke the a=
uthentication credentials of someone as their desk is being cleaned out and=
 they are escorted out the door, and the PKI may not be able to respond in =
the desired timeframe.  That may be an extreme example, but there are scena=

I know that this theory exists.

But using a self-signed local OCSP signer cert means that there
is no such thing as revocation checking for an omnipotent irrevocable
local OCSP signer.  Rolling/updating that local OCSP signer key is
completely out-of-scope for OCSP/rfc2560 and PKIX/rfc5280.

The bottom line of such a (lack of) security archtecture is that
revocation is merely a second thought, not something with a
solid design.

I would have at least expected the creation of an "local OCSP signer CA"
that issues "local OCSP signer certs", so that the CA cert could be
protected by a procedure that requires manual interaction and the
rolling of the local OCSP signer cert would be based on regular
PKIX mechanisms, rather than being completely out-of-scope.

If you create a local CA for the purpose of issuing local OCSP signer 
certificates, how are you going to distribute that CA's public key?  As 
a self-signed certificate?  How are you going to revoke that CA's key if 
it becomes compromised?  PKIs need trust anchors, and those trust 
anchors' keys have to be managed through out-of-band means, whether the 
key is used as a trust anchor for certification path validation or to 
verify OCSP responses.

Are you trying to say that PKIX = RFC 5280?  If that's the case, then 
why does http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pkix/ list so many other 
documents?  Any suggestion that the use of a self-signed certificate 
that outside the scope of RFC 5280 cannot be within the scope of another 
document created by the PKIX WG is simply your personal opinion.  And, 
as you would say, I violently disagree with that.

I have already removed the language relating to public delegation
points from the draft so that in the new scheme the CA MUST check for
CAA records from the leaf node right up to the TLD.

ie if there is no CAA record in example.com, then a CAA record in .com
will apply.

This change makes CAA consistent with the DNS architecture but makes
the 'abusive CAA record' problem more severe, particularly if VeriSign
was still a CA in addition to being the registry of .com. I propose to
address this issue by changing the language of section 3 as follows:

Current:

        Before issuing a certificate, a compliant CA MUST check for publication
        of a relevant CAA Resource Record(s).  If such record(s) are published,
        the  requested certificate MUST consistent with them if it is
to be issued.
        If the certificate requested is not consistent with the
relevant CAA RRs,
        the CA MUST NOT issue the certificate.

New:

        Before issuing a certificate, a compliant CA MUST check for publication
        of an applicable CAA Resource Record set. If such a record set
exists, a CA
        MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA determines that either
        (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable
CAA Resource
        Record set or (2) that an exception specified in the
applicable Certificate
        Policy or Certification Practices Statement Applies.

Note that adoption of CAA is an option for the CA. So if they decide
to implement, they can decide to implement with exceptions and that is
OK, provided that the exceptions are documented and in the case of a
public CA, that they are published.

The practical effect of these changes is that they cancel each other
out. The CA implementing CAA now has to climb the whole DNS tree each
and every time regardless of what their policy says. They can however
publish a policy that states 'we ignore CAA records in TLDs' or 'we
ignore CAA records in domains listed in the CABForum Well Known
issuing points list' or whatever.

A CA could even point to a list on Wikipedia if they felt like, though
I would think they would find it rather difficult to get Microsoft,
Google, Mozilla and co to accept their CPS when they are trying to get
their anchor embedded.

In effect the policy loophole required because the world is
complicated moves from the technical specification back into the
policy world where it belongs.

[Denis: No. The proposal is fully compliant with id-pkix-ocsp-basic. 
It uses a field defined in id-pkix-ocsp-basic]

[Denis: No. You misread RFC 2560. A client which does not understand 
responseExtensions 
within ResponseData shall drop the whole response, but a client which does 
not understand 
singleExtensions with SingleResponse shall only drop the single response. 
I am proposing to use singleExtensions with SingleResponse].

[Denis: Thus, this would be a client that is not compliant. However, I 
recognize that RFC 2560 
does not explain how to process singleExtensions with SingleResponse. In 
the draft I have 
prepared (and posted yesterday to the rfc editor), I am providing full 
details about:

     - the building of a request by an OCSP client,
     - the processing of a received request by an OCSP server, 
     - the building of a response by an OCSP server, and 
     - the processing of a response by an OCSP client].

[Denis: RFC 5280 states:

   A certificate-using system MUST reject the certificate if it encounters
   a critical extension it does not recognize or a critical extension
   that contains information that it cannot process.  A non-critical
   extension MAY be ignored if it is not recognized, but MUST be processed 

   if it is recognized.

The extension I have drafted is compliant with this text (which was 
dedicated 
to PKCs). Depending upon its content, the extension will be marked 
critical or 
non critical by the server. A single OID is thus needed to define that 
extension. 
What is important is the way the client shall process it. I will re-use 
the text 
from RFC 5280 in the right order: 

   1) an extension that is recognized MUST be processed.
   2) a critical extension that is not recognized must invalidate 
      the SEQUENCE structure where it is present.
   3) a non-critical extension that is not recognized may be ignored].

[Denis: A fallback mechanism cannot provide the same level of security as 
on line service. Anyway, The following question should be answered:
 - How many OCSP implementations are currently using a singleExtension 
which is marked critical ?
 - How many OCSP clients are currently using these OCSP implementations 
and are unable to 
   understand these singleExtensions which is marked critical ?
 - How many of these OCSP clients are currently using a CRL fallback 
mechanism when they encounter 
   a singleExtension which is marked critical ?

I believe that the answer to the last question is none. 
So the point you raised is not an issue]

[Denis: Doing this, is opening the door to false detections. Let me 
explain: 
as a client I will send purposely wrong hashes. Using your wording "the CA 
can detect 
when there is a problem, and CA helpdesk has access to that information 
...". 
I can keep busy the CA helpdesk nights and days, since most OCSP clients 
do not 
authenticate to the OCSP server].

[Denis: the server shall use a hash algorithm that is as good (or as bad) 
as the one 
used by the client in its OCSP request. At least, the server is sure that 
the client 
will be able to use the same hash function, so interoperability is 
guaranteed].

<br><tt><font size=2>&nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; If the OCSP requestor does not indicate that it supports new
response<br>
&gt; &gt; semantics, then the OCSP responder can not distinguish rfc2560
clients<br>
&gt; &gt; from updated clients!<br>
 <br>
&gt; &gt; The prerequisite for any negotiation of new features is that<br>
&gt; &gt; the request contains an indication about the clients additional<br>
&gt; &gt; capabilities. &nbsp;Without it, the server should not be _extremely_<br>
&gt; &gt; conservative about changes in the response.<br>
 <br>
&gt; &gt; [Denis: No. The solution does not need any change in the request]<br>
 <br>
&gt; Oh yes, you do. &nbsp;That requirement is described in rfc2560 section
4.4.3.<br>

 <br>
&gt; An OCSP server is not allowed to return something other than a<br>
&gt; basic ocsp response unless the client has included a requestExtension<br>
&gt; that indicates that the client recognizes other than id-pkix-ocsp-basic.<br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2 color=#0000e0><b>[Denis: No. The proposal is fully

<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This solution uses a new singleResponse extension, which
indicates that <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the serial number of the certificate is not present <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the list of the certificates issued by the CA to which
the OCSP <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responder has access.<br>
 <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When this extension contains that indication, the critical
flag SHALL be <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; set.<br>
 <br>
&gt; &gt; Now that looks quite dangerous to me. &nbsp;A client that did
not indicate<br>
&gt; &gt; to understand the extension is indistinguishable from an simple<br>
&gt; &gt; rfc2560 client. &nbsp;And the simple rfc2560 should drop the
OCSP response<br>
&gt; &gt; with an unrecognized critical extension. &nbsp;Which will either
result<br>

It doesn't look like you define "applicable"; I propose that you =

and appropriate for cases such as a CA whose CP or CPS says "we'll issue =
certs even if we find a CAA record in the TLD".

Where "whatever" includes, "We ignore CAA records at any owner name
except the owner name actually included in the request," or, "We
ignore CAA records at any owner name except the owner name included in
the request, or the direct parent," right?  It would appear to do.

Yes. Such is the nature of CPs and CPSs, the policy underpinnings of our PKI.

You're correct.  I'm sorry, I misinterpreted the

That is actually not what rfc2560:

   Support for any specific extension is OPTIONAL. The critical flag
   SHOULD NOT be set for any of them.  Section 4.4 suggests several
   useful extensions.  Additional extensions MAY be defined in
   additional RFCs. Unrecognized extensions MUST be ignored (unless they
   have the critical flag set and are not understood).

according to rfc2560, OCSP extensions that are critical may be ignored.
The logical negation of MUST is "everything but MUST", which amounts to MAY,
this is in particular encouraged by the "The critical flag SHOUD NOT be
set for any of them.".

The problem goes *much* deeper.  rfc2560 does not define that there could
be multiple singleResponses with different content contained in a reply,
and the strategy how to evaluate them if there are.

So is PERFECTLY compliant for an rfc2560 client to search the singleResponse
for a match to the cert in question, look at the first match that is
encountered, and not look at any other singleResponses AT ALL.

Whether the rfc2560 processes the singleResponse sequence from top to
bottom or from bottom to top, or in any other order, is UNDEFINED in
rfc2560, which means, that there MUST only be one singleResponse for
any particular cert, so that the result from processing the rfc2560
will be independent from the ordering in which the rfc2560 client/RP
processes the singleResponse entries.

This text of rfc5280 applies exclusively to a certificate that contains
critical certificate extensions.  There is seperate text in rfc5280 that
applies exclusively to critical CRL extensions any yet another seperate
text in rfc5280 that applies exclusively to critical CRLEntryExtensions.

None of the text in rfc5280 applies to rfc2560/OCSP extensions.

But you must realize that this is a change of the OCSP protocol, and
a requirement that does not apply to the installed base of rfc2560.

What this would still be lacking is the definition of either
a well-defined order of processing of singleResponses, or a well-defined
behaviour for the presence of multiple (potentially conflicting)
singleResponses for a single certificate.  Sorting this out will
also be something that does not apply to the installed base of rfc2560.

At which point we're pretty much defining OCSP 2.0, even if it does not
show on the version number of the wire protocol.


An unsolicited, backwards-incompatible critical singleResponse extension
in combination with two conflicting singleResponses for the exact same
cert in a single OCSP response is a complete NO GO.  It would have
pretty much nothing in common with the original rfc2560 protocol.

It is impossible to come up with any meaningful figures about the
installed base of a 12-year old protocol.  Doing backwards-incompatible
in a NON-negotiating fashion (i.e. interoperability impairing) is
incompatible with the spirit of the IETF and IETF protocols.

Which part of "the CA helpdesk has access to that information" don't
you understand?  There will always be numerous ways to tick off "alarms"
in IDSses/Monitoring and to keep Helpdesks busy, so there is no
additional risk involved by being able to provide CA helpdesks with
additional information to resolve customer support calls.

I actually prefer protocols that have a facility to negotiate to actively
use that facility.  the CertID in the request can only accomodate a
single AlgorithmIdentifier, in which case the client would typically
make a conservative assumption (SHA1), whereas the the additional
singleRequestExtension could use SHA256 in addition, which means that
the client will get some level of algorithm agility for free, without
having to submit two independent requests.

I'm sure there are plenty of resources available that describe the
advantage of _not_ distributing CA certs of online CAs as trust anchors,
but instead create a seperate offline rootCA instance where it is less
of a problem that its cert is not subject to regular revocation checking.

By using a local OCSP signer CA to issue local OCSP signer certs
(possibly short-lived, so that revocation checking for that cert
 can be entirely obviated), all involved certs (local OCSP signer CA
and local OCSP signer cert) can be fully PKIX-compliant certs and
PKIX compliant path validation can be performed, rather than doing
out-of-scope certs with out-of-scope key management.


While rfc5280 does not define trust anchor management itself,
it can not exist without trust anchors.  The idea here is to make
new scenarios work exactly like existing scenarios, so that existing
protocols and procedures can be re-used.


Adding certificate revocation checking to a PKI by creating 
an omnipotent irrevocable self-signed OCSP signer entity,
looks extremely odd to me, I'm sorry.

If unknown with a marked critical extension has the desired effect, I
would be ok with it. But I agree it is not a nice solution.

I don't see what is bad about defining the ASN1 'revoked' status to
mean 'not valid' and adding in an extension to allow the server to
report additional status info

Agreed, we have to stop the OCSP chasing chain there. The object is to
have the responder give a report that as a minimum causes the cert to
be rejected and preferably causes a loud complaint somewhere.

What is proposed is not an 'unknown' response so much as redefining
the semantics of unknown for the case of an authoritative server.

What happened in practice is pretty ugly. See all the questions about

Good point, I had forgotten about stapling.

[Denis: this is not fully correct. RFC 2560 does define that there may be 
multiple singleResponses in a reply. However it is true that there is no 
algorithm for their individual evaluation].

[Denis: ...RFC 2560 states: "Unrecognized extensions MUST be ignored 
           (unless they have the critical flag set and are not 
understood).
           The single change would be to remove the sentence : 
           "The critical flag SHOULD NOT be set for any of them".

[Denis: I am only thinking of a single extension. So there is not yet any 
conflict possible.
If the PKIX WG defines critical extensions that may conflict, then the 
rule will be indicated 
at that time].

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: An OCSP client which does not recognize a critical
extension <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within singleExtensions SHALL drop the individual response
where that <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critical extension is present but may accept other
responses within <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the field responses&quot;]<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would not be surprised if a client that obtains a response
for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; an request about a singular cert would drop the entire response
if<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it contained an unexpected (=non-negotiated) critical responseExtension<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the first single response.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; [Denis: Thus, this would be a client that is not compliant. However,
I <br>
&gt; &gt; recognize that RFC 2560 does not explain how to process singleExtensions<br>
&gt; &gt; with SingleResponse. In the draft I have prepared (and posted
yesterday<br>
&gt; &gt; to the rfc editor), I am providing full details about:<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the building of a request by an OCSP client,<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the processing of a received request by
an OCSP server, <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the building of a response by an OCSP server,
and <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the processing of a response by an OCSP
client].<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The problem goes *much* deeper. &nbsp;rfc2560 does not define that
there could<br>
&gt; be multiple singleResponses with different content contained in a
reply,<br>
&gt; and the strategy how to evaluate them if there are.<br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2 color=#0000e0><b>[Denis: this is not fully correct.
RFC 2560 does define that there may be <br>
multiple singleResponses in a reply. However it is true that there is no
<br>
algorithm for their individual evaluation]. </b></font></tt>
<br>
<br><tt><font size=2>&nbsp;<br>
&gt; So is PERFECTLY compliant for an rfc2560 client to search the singleResponse<br>
&gt; for a match to the cert in question, look at the first match that
is<br>
&gt; encountered, and not look at any other singleResponses AT ALL.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Whether the rfc2560 processes the singleResponse sequence from top
to<br>
&gt; bottom or from bottom to top, or in any other order, is UNDEFINED
in<br>
&gt; rfc2560, which means, that there MUST only be one singleResponse for<br>
&gt; any particular cert, so that the result from processing the rfc2560<br>
&gt; will be independent from the ordering in which the rfc2560 client/RP<br>
&gt; processes the singleResponse entries.<br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2 color=#0000e0><b>[Denis: this is not an issue since
a singleExtension only applies to a <br>
single response]</b></font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2>&nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would consider it strange if an OCSP response about a
singular<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cert contains multiple single repsonses about the exact
same cert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with different properties (one with a critical extension,
and one<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; without a critical extension). &nbsp;Since there is no specific
ordering<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; defined for processing multiple single responses for one
singular cert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in rfc2560, a response with multiple responses for a singular
cert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a clear violation of the protocol defined rfc2560.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; [Denis: RFC 5280 states:<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;A certificate-using system MUST reject the certificate
if it encounters<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;a critical extension it does not recognize or a
critical extension<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;that contains information that it cannot process.
&nbsp;A non-critical<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;extension MAY be ignored if it is not recognized,
but MUST be processed <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This text of rfc5280 applies exclusively to a certificate that contains<br>
&gt; critical certificate extensions. &nbsp;There is seperate text in rfc5280
that<br>
&gt; applies exclusively to critical CRL extensions any yet another seperate<br>
&gt; text in rfc5280 that applies exclusively to critical CRLEntryExtensions.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; None of the text in rfc5280 applies to rfc2560/OCSP extensions.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) an extension that is recognized MUST be processed.<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) a critical extension that is not recognized must
invalidate <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the SEQUENCE structure where it is present.<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) a non-critical extension that is not recognized
may be ignored].<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But you must realize that this is a change of the OCSP protocol, and<br>
&gt; a requirement that does not apply to the installed base of rfc2560.<br>

<br>
<br><tt><font size=2>&gt; An unsolicited, backwards-incompatible critical
singleResponse extension<br>
&gt; in combination with two conflicting singleResponses for the exact
same<br>
&gt; cert in a single OCSP response is a complete NO GO. &nbsp;It would
have<br>
&gt; pretty much nothing in common with the original rfc2560 protocol.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You can not change behaviour of the installed base by adding
a note<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to a protocol update. &nbsp;The only thing you can reliably
affect is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the behaviour of *NEW* implementations, and a hard-to-predict<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; subset of the installed base when it is patched.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; [Denis: A fallback mechanism cannot provide the same level of
security as <br>
&gt; &gt; on line service. Anyway, The following question should be answered:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp;- How many OCSP implementations are currently using a singleExtension
<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;which is marked critical ?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It is impossible to come up with any meaningful figures about the<br>
&gt; installed base of a 12-year old protocol. &nbsp;Doing backwards-incompatible<br>
&gt; in a NON-negotiating fashion (i.e. interoperability impairing) is<br>
&gt; incompatible with the spirit of the IETF and IETF protocols.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: returning the hash provides the same benefit.
The comparison <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be done by the client rather than by the server].<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As someone regular doing customer support, I strongly dislike
the <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reverse approach.<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an issue where it would be quite sensible to require
the client<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to send the certificate hash, so that the CA can detect
when there is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a problem, and CA helpdesk has access to that information
when the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cert hash mismatch leads to clients/RPs failing authentication--rather<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than having to jump hoops in order to trace arbitrary third-party
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; software for reasons why it keeps failing cert revocation
check<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; [Denis: Doing this, is opening the door to false detections.
Let me <br>
&gt; &gt; explain: <br>
&gt; &gt; as a client I will send purposely wrong hashes. Using your wording<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;the CA can detect when there is a problem, and CA helpdesk
has access<br>
&gt; &gt; to that information ...&quot;. <br>
&gt; &gt; I can keep busy the CA helpdesk nights and days,<br>
&gt; &gt; since most OCSP clients do not authenticate to the OCSP server].<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Which part of &quot;the CA helpdesk has access to that information&quot;
don't<br>
&gt; you understand? &nbsp;There will always be numerous ways to tick off
&quot;alarms&quot;<br>
&gt; in IDSses/Monitoring and to keep Helpdesks busy, so there is no<br>
&gt; additional risk involved by being able to provide CA helpdesks with<br>
&gt; additional information to resolve customer support calls.<br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2 color=#0000e0><b>[Denis: You missed the point. The
helpdesk will be triggered by the CA <br>
(rather than customer support calls) for problems which do not exist.</b></font></tt>
<br>
<br><tt><font size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The client can use the best/strongest
hash available, whereas the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; server would have to use the weakest (when the client did
not convey<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything through extensions about its capabilities.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; [Denis: the server shall use a hash algorithm that is as good
(or as bad) <br>
&gt; &gt; as the one used by the client in its OCSP request. At least,
the server<br>
&gt; &gt; is sure that the client will be able to use the same hash function,<br>
&gt; &gt; so interoperability is guaranteed]. <br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2>&gt; I actually prefer protocols that have a facility
to negotiate to actively<br>
&gt; use that facility. &nbsp;the CertID in the request can only accomodate
a<br>
&gt; single AlgorithmIdentifier, in which case the client would typically<br>
&gt; make a conservative assumption (SHA1), whereas the the additional<br>
&gt; singleRequestExtension could use SHA256 in addition, which means that<br>
&gt; the client will get some level of algorithm agility for free, without<br>
&gt; having to submit two independent requests.<br>
</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2 color=#0000e0><b>[Denis: It looks like applying the

solution which avoids <br>

Martin,

I answered too quickly to your last email.

The text you mentioned ("The critical flag SHOULD NOT be set for any of 
them") 
is in section 4.1.2, i.e. Notes on the Request Syntax.

So it only applies to the request, not to the response.

There is no text in RFC 2560 which forbids (or even does not recommend) to 
use critical single extensions 
within a response.

<br><font size=2 face="Arial">========================================================================</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><tt><font size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now that looks quite dangerous
to me. &nbsp;A client that did not indicate<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to understand the extension is indistinguishable
from an simple<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rfc2560 client. &nbsp;And the simple rfc2560 should
drop the OCSP response<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with an unrecognized critical extension. &nbsp;Which
will either result<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the client to skip OCSP checking (bad) or to
try other responders<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or CRLs (also bad).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: No. You misread RFC 2560. A client which does not
understand <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responseExtensions within ResponseData shall drop the whole
response,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but a client which does not understand singleExtensions
with<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SingleResponse shall only drop the single response. <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am proposing to use singleExtensions with SingleResponse].
<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; That is actually not what rfc2560:<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;Support for any specific extension is OPTIONAL.
The critical flag<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;SHOULD NOT be set for any of them. &nbsp;Section
4.4 suggests several<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;useful extensions. &nbsp;Additional extensions MAY
be defined in<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;additional RFCs. Unrecognized extensions MUST be
ignored (unless they<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;have the critical flag set and are not understood).<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; according to rfc2560, OCSP extensions that are critical may be
ignored.<br>
&gt; &gt; The logical negation of MUST is &quot;everything but MUST&quot;,
which amounts to MAY,<br>
&gt; &gt; this is in particular encouraged by the &quot;The critical flag
SHOUD NOT be<br>
&gt; &gt; set for any of them.&quot;.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: ... but the text states &quot;Unrecognized extensions MUST
be ignored <br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (unless they have the critical
flag set and are not understood). <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: An OCSP client which does not recognize
a critical extension <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within singleExtensions SHALL drop the individual
response where that <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critical extension is present but may accept other
responses within <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the field responses&quot;]<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would not be surprised if a client that obtains a
response for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an request about a singular cert would drop the entire
response if<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it contained an unexpected (=non-negotiated) critical
responseExtension<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the first single response.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: Thus, this would be a client that is not compliant.
However, I <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognize that RFC 2560 does not explain how to process
singleExtensions<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with SingleResponse. In the draft I have prepared (and posted
yesterday<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the rfc editor), I am providing full details about:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the building of a request by an OCSP
client,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the processing of a received request
by an OCSP server, <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the building of a response by an OCSP
server, and <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the processing of a response by an
OCSP client].<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The problem goes *much* deeper. &nbsp;rfc2560 does not define
that there could<br>
&gt; &gt; be multiple singleResponses with different content contained
in a reply,<br>
&gt; &gt; and the strategy how to evaluate them if there are.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: this is not fully correct. RFC 2560 does define that there
may be <br>
&gt; multiple singleResponses in a reply. However it is true that there
is no <br>
&gt; algorithm for their individual evaluation]. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; So is PERFECTLY compliant for an rfc2560 client to search the
singleResponse<br>
&gt; &gt; for a match to the cert in question, look at the first match
that is<br>
&gt; &gt; encountered, and not look at any other singleResponses AT ALL.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Whether the rfc2560 processes the singleResponse sequence from
top to<br>
&gt; &gt; bottom or from bottom to top, or in any other order, is UNDEFINED
in<br>
&gt; &gt; rfc2560, which means, that there MUST only be one singleResponse
for<br>
&gt; &gt; any particular cert, so that the result from processing the rfc2560<br>
&gt; &gt; will be independent from the ordering in which the rfc2560 client/RP<br>
&gt; &gt; processes the singleResponse entries.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: this is not an issue since a singleExtension only applies
to a <br>
&gt; single response] <br>
&gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would consider it strange if an OCSP response about
a singular<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cert contains multiple single repsonses about the exact
same cert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with different properties (one with a critical extension,
and one<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without a critical extension). &nbsp;Since there is
no specific ordering<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defined for processing multiple single responses for
one singular cert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in rfc2560, a response with multiple responses for
a singular cert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be a clear violation of the protocol defined
rfc2560.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: RFC 5280 states:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;A certificate-using system MUST reject the
certificate if it encounters<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;a critical extension it does not recognize
or a critical extension<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;that contains information that it cannot process.
&nbsp;A non-critical<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;extension MAY be ignored if it is not recognized,
but MUST beprocessed <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; This text of rfc5280 applies exclusively to a certificate that
contains<br>
&gt; &gt; critical certificate extensions. &nbsp;There is seperate text
in rfc5280 that<br>
&gt; &gt; applies exclusively to critical CRL extensions any yet another
seperate<br>
&gt; &gt; text in rfc5280 that applies exclusively to critical CRLEntryExtensions.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; None of the text in rfc5280 applies to rfc2560/OCSP extensions.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) an extension that is recognized MUST be
processed.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) a critical extension that is not recognized
must invalidate <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the SEQUENCE structure where it is
present.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) a non-critical extension that is not recognized
may be ignored].<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; But you must realize that this is a change of the OCSP protocol,
and<br>
&gt; &gt; a requirement that does not apply to the installed base of rfc2560.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: ...RFC 2560 states: &quot;Unrecognized extensions MUST be
ignored <br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (unless they have the critical
flag set and are not understood). <br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The single change would be
to remove the sentence : <br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The critical flag SHOULD
NOT be set for any of them&quot;. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; What this would still be lacking is the definition of either<br>
&gt; &gt; a well-defined order of processing of singleResponses, or a well-defined<br>
&gt; &gt; behaviour for the presence of multiple (potentially conflicting)<br>
&gt; &gt; singleResponses for a single certificate. &nbsp;Sorting this
out will<br>
&gt; &gt; also be something that does not apply to the installed base of
rfc2560.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: I am only thinking of a single extension. So there is not
<br>
&gt; yet any conflict possible. <br>
&gt; If the PKIX WG defines critical extensions that may conflict, then
<br>
&gt; the rule will be indicated <br>
&gt; at that time]. <br>
&gt; &nbsp; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; At which point we're pretty much defining OCSP 2.0, even if it
does not<br>
&gt; &gt; show on the version number of the wire protocol.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: &nbsp;No. I don't think so] <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; An unsolicited, backwards-incompatible critical singleResponse
extension<br>
&gt; &gt; in combination with two conflicting singleResponses for the exact
same<br>
&gt; &gt; cert in a single OCSP response is a complete NO GO. &nbsp;It
would have<br>
&gt; &gt; pretty much nothing in common with the original rfc2560 protocol.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can not change behaviour of the installed base
by adding a note<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a protocol update. &nbsp;The only thing you can
reliably affect is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the behaviour of *NEW* implementations, and a hard-to-predict<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subset of the installed base when it is patched.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: A fallback mechanism cannot provide the same level
of security as <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on line service. Anyway, The following question should be
answered:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;- How many OCSP implementations are currently using
a singleExtension <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;which is marked critical ?<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; It is impossible to come up with any meaningful figures about
the<br>
&gt; &gt; installed base of a 12-year old protocol. &nbsp;Doing backwards-incompatible<br>
&gt; &gt; in a NON-negotiating fashion (i.e. interoperability impairing)
is<br>
&gt; &gt; incompatible with the spirit of the IETF and IETF protocols.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: returning the hash provides the same benefit.
The comparison <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be done by the client rather than by the
server].<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As someone regular doing customer support, I strongly
dislike the <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reverse approach.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is an issue where it would be quite sensible to
require the client<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to send the certificate hash, so that the CA can detect
when there is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a problem, and CA helpdesk has access to that information
when the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cert hash mismatch leads to clients/RPs failing authentication--rather<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than having to jump hoops in order to trace arbitrary
third-party <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; software for reasons why it keeps failing cert revocation
check<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: Doing this, is opening the door to false detections.
Let me <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain: <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a client I will send purposely wrong hashes. Using your
wording<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;the CA can detect when there is a problem, and CA
helpdesk has access<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to that information ...&quot;. <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can keep busy the CA helpdesk nights and days,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; since most OCSP clients do not authenticate to the OCSP
server].<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Which part of &quot;the CA helpdesk has access to that information&quot;
don't<br>
&gt; &gt; you understand? &nbsp;There will always be numerous ways to tick
off &quot;alarms&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; in IDSses/Monitoring and to keep Helpdesks busy, so there is
no<br>
&gt; &gt; additional risk involved by being able to provide CA helpdesks
with<br>
&gt; &gt; additional information to resolve customer support calls.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: You missed the point. The helpdesk will be triggered by the
CA <br>
&gt; (rather than customer support calls) for problems which do not exist.
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The client can use the best/strongest hash available,
whereas the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; server would have to use the weakest (when the client
did not convey<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything through extensions about its capabilities.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Denis: the server shall use a hash algorithm that is as
good (or as bad) <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the one used by the client in its OCSP request. At least,
the server<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is sure that the client will be able to use the same hash
function,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so interoperability is guaranteed]. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I actually prefer protocols that have a facility to negotiate
to actively<br>
&gt; &gt; use that facility. &nbsp;the CertID in the request can only accomodate
a<br>
&gt; &gt; single AlgorithmIdentifier, in which case the client would typically<br>
&gt; &gt; make a conservative assumption (SHA1), whereas the the additional<br>
&gt; &gt; singleRequestExtension could use SHA256 in addition, which means
that<br>
&gt; &gt; the client will get some level of algorithm agility for free,
without<br>
&gt; &gt; having to submit two independent requests.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; [Denis: It looks like applying the following sentence: <br>
&gt; Why make it simple when we can make it complex ? :-) <br>
&gt; I believe it is better to have a solution which avoids <br>
&gt; the use any kind of singleRequestExtension] <br>

It could be that I still do not understand what you're really
trying to accomplish and how.

I do not have a problem with critical extensions (in both request and
response) in principle,  I just wanted to point out that the presence
of (and dealing with) a an extension that is marked critical is
not specified in rfc2560, which means that ANY behaviour is conforming,
although there is some likelyhood that the presence of an unrecognized
extension that is marked critical will result in the complete response
to be dropped/ignored.

Therefore sending a critical extension in an OCSP request would probably
be a bad idea, because a server that does not recognize it may return
an error (and it would require a second request or out-of-band meta-knowledge
to know whether a server supports the extension).


The OCSP server returning an OCSP resonse with a critical singleResponse
extension, which has *NOT* been offered in the OCSP request through
a non-critical singleRequest extensions is a BAD idea.  Nothing
in rfc2560 descibed the exact semantics of critical singleResponseExtensions,
so for rfc2560 they're simply prohibited--that is an implicit consistency
requirement.


That an unrecognized critical singleResponse extension applies should
not cause the rejection of the whole response is not backed by any
existing specifications.  rfc2560 certainly does not specify it.
So the behaviour is undefined.


For those who believe that rfc5280 should provide fallback guidance,
look at what semantics rfc5280 specifies for critical crlEntryExtensions:

  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5.3

                                                         If a CRL
   contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application cannot
   process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL to determine the
   status of any certificates.  However, applications may ignore
   unrecognized non-critical CRL entry extensions.


rfc5280 specifies that a single unrecognized critical crlEntryExtension
anywhere in the CRL should cause the RP to completely ignore/drop the
entire signed object (the complete CRL).


The semantics that you are asking--the criticality of a
singleResponseExtensions applies only to that particular singleResponse
and should be ignored with respect to all other information in the 
signed object (the OCSP response) is not specified in rfc2560,
and is the exact opposite of the sematics specified in a vaguely
similar situation in section 5.3 of PKIX/rfc5280 for the criticality of
CRLEntryExtensions.


I'm OK with extending OCSP to support such semantics, provided that
these semantics are properly negotiated(!) between OCSP requestor and OCSP
responder, which means that the OCSP request MUST contain a request
extension indicating support for these semantics.


However, since there are scenarios where OCSP responses are forwarded
_without_ an original OCSP request from the client that is supposed
to process them (e.g. in the TLS extensions for OCSP response stapling),
use of critical OCSP response extensions ought to be limited to
very exceptional situations that will not occur in regular usage
scenarios where e.g. OCSP response stapling is desirable.

The IESG has received a request from the Public-Key Infrastructure
(X.509) WG (pkix) to consider the following document:
- 'Updates to the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile'
  <draft-ietf-pkix-rfc5280-clarifications-08.txt> as Proposed Standard

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action. Please send substantive comments to the
ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by 2012-09-05. Exceptionally, comments may be
sent to iesg@ietf.org instead. In either case, please retain the
beginning of the Subject line to allow automated sorting.

Abstract


   This document updates RFC 5280, the Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   Profile.  This document changes the set of acceptable encoding
   methods for the explicitText field of the user notice policy
   qualifier and clarifies the rules for converting internationalized
   domain name labels to ASCII.  This document also provides some
   clarifications on the use of self-signed certificates, trust anchors,
   and some updated security considerations.

This is one of the many topics on which RFC 2560 is obscure; hence why we

This is an interesting point which deserves a separate thread.
I believe this is an error and that we should discuss it as an errata to 
RFC 5280.

I now understand your point, but I do not think that the reject of a whole 
response is logical 
if there is a critical unrecognized extension within a single response.

RFC 5280 states on page 69, section 5.3 : CRL Entry Extensions

"If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application 
cannot
process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL to determine the 
status 
of any certificates". 

This should be changed into:

"If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application

Sorry for the long delay answering you here Stefan, I was traveling...

In my mind, we want to enable both these since they are aimed at two 
different stakeholder groups - one option is a decision for site owners 
(stapling) and the other is a decision for CAs (OCSP-over-DNS), even 
though they may both be considered to be aimed at performance 
improvement for certificate validation checking.

In terms of RRTYPE, that is still under discussion and specifically 
deployment is the main consideration here. There are certainly pros and 
cons to defining a new type or not, and it may be a question we settle 
by taking it to the list. For now, perhaps I can encourage Max or Olafur 
to regurgitate a summary of our internal discussions to replay for the 
list some of our thinking to date.

Regards,
_Scott

This proposed change seems horribly wrong. The change would mean that =
there is no reason to mark a CRL entry extension as critical or not: the =

I agree with Paul's conclusion, while I would rationalize it more logically=
.

Specifically, per Section 5.3.3, the certificate issuer not only impacts th=
e entry in which it appears, but subsequent entries.  Thus, adopting Denis'=
s proposal can cause undesirable security issues.

I'll note that your suggested replacement would create a security problem.

First of all, this semantic has been present in the spec since rfc2459.
Your suggested change would be backwards-incompatible and affect EVERY
PKI implementation that implements CRL processing.  You simply
can not perform such a change to an installed base at this point in time.

So I'm opposing your change.

Curiously, ITU-T X.509 differs from PKIX (rfc2459->rfc5280) on the
semantics when encountering an unrecognized critical CrlEntryExtension:
(relevant parts prefixed with *>)

As you may notice, X.509 does *NOT* specify, that the CRLEntry should
be ignored when accompanied by a critical CRLEntryExtension.  It would
cause a security problem if it did.

Quoting from ITU-T Tec. X.509 (08/2005), Section 7.3, top of page 18:

*>  NOTE 4 -- When an implementation processing a certificate revocation
*>  list does not recognize a critical extension in the crlEntryExtensions
*>  field, it shall assume that, at a minimum, the identified certificate
*>  has been revoked and is no longer valid and perform additional actions
    concerning that revoked certificate as dictated by local policy.
    When an implementation does not recognize a critical extension in the
    crlExtensions field, it shall assume that identified certificates
    have been revoked and are no longer valid. However in the latter case,
    since the list may not be complete, certificates that have not been
    identified as being revoked cannot be assumed to be valid. In this case
    local policy shall dictate the action to be taken. In any case local
    policy may dictate actions in addition to and/or stronger than those
    stated in this Specification.

    NOTE 5 -- If an extension affects the treatment of the list
    (e.g., multiple CRLs need to be scanned to examine the entire list of
    revoked certificates, or an entry may represent a range of certificates),
    then that extension shall be indicated as critical in the crlExtensions
    field regardless of where the extension is placed in the CRL.
*>  An extension indicated in the crlEntryExtensions field of an entry shall
*>  be placed in that entry and shall affect only the certificate(s)
*>  specified in that entry.


Although I find the original X.509 semantics for processing
CRLEntryExtensions much more reasonable than what rfc2459->rfc5280 says,
I firmly believe that as IETF we can not retroactively change the
semantics for processing critical CRLEntryExtensions for
rfc2459->rfc5280 & implementations based on these (proposed) standards
(in a backwards-incompatible fashion).

Denis, you're (mostly) correct on "returning the hash".

The presence of the certificate hash in the OCSP response in a
non-critical(!) singleResponseExtension is vital for all scenarios
where OCSP responses are processed without a prior OCSP request,
i.e. all caching and all stapling and proxy scenarios.

But I still believe that adding the hash into the request provides
additional benefits, so I'd like to see both possibilities.
Probably something like

CertificateImprint ::= SEQUENCE   {
    hashAlgorithm              AlgorithmIdentifier,
    certificateHash            OCTET STRING }

plus an ASN.1 OID for wrapping it into an Extension...

Martin,

Your email is quite interesting and I was not thinking that the discussion 
on OCSP would lead 
to look at CRLs as defined in  X.509.

Let me first say that RFC  2459 <--> RFC 5280 are supposed to be a 
*profile* of X.509, 
which means dropping some of its complexity, but not changing its 
semantics.

RFC  2459 <--> RFC 5280 are clearly changing the semantics of the 
processing of crlEntryExtensions.

Remainder: do not confuse crlEntryExtensions with crlExtensions.

Let me put together the two paragraphs extracted from X.509 by Martin:

NOTE 5 -- (...)
          An extension indicated in the crlEntryExtensions field of an 
entry shall
          be placed in that entry and shall affect only the certificate(s)
          specified in that entry.

NOTE 4 -- When an implementation processing a certificate revocation
          list does not recognize a critical extension in the 
crlEntryExtensions
          field, it shall assume that, at a minimum, the identified 
certificate
          has been revoked and is no longer valid and perform additional 
actions
          concerning that revoked certificate as dictated by local policy.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application 
   cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
   determine the status of this certificate". :

The key question is : which text "makes sense" ?

Using an example, let us see the implications using a CRL with 5000 
entries.

Using the text from X.509, when you look for the revocation status of a 
certificate in a CRL you look 
for the serial number of that certificate. If an entry contains that 
serial number,  then you look also 
at that crlEntryExtensions (you process it) and you are done with a 
result.

Using the text from RFC 5280, when you look for the revocation status of a 
certificate in a CRL, you need 
to look at each of the 5000 entries to see if there is a single 
crlEntryExtension that 
you don't understand and which is marked critical. If one exists, you 
can't determine the revocation status 
of that certificate, even if there is no single critical crlEntryExtension 
 present in the entry which contains 
the serial number of that certificate.

The text from X.509 makes sense, while the text from RFC 5280 does not.

 If we keep the current text from RFC 5280, then RFC 5280 is not 
compatible with X.509.

This is a serious issue.

Many calls for tenders request "X.509 compatibility" and also request RFC 
5280 compatibility for convenience.
How would it be possible to refer to two documents that are incompatible ?

If the certificate appears in the CRL it should be treated as revoked,
whether or not the client can process any entry extensions.  That is what is
stated by x.509 as quoted by Martin and I fail to see an instance in which
doing otherwise would make any sense.

Subject: Re: [pkix] Errata in section 5.3 from RFC 5280

 

Martin, 

Your email is quite interesting and I was not thinking that the discussion
on OCSP would lead 
to look at CRLs as defined in  X.509. 

Let me first say that RFC  2459 <--> RFC 5280 are supposed to be a *profile*
of X.509, 
which means dropping some of its complexity, but not changing its semantics.


RFC  2459 <--> RFC 5280 are clearly changing the semantics of the processing
of crlEntryExtensions. 

Remainder: do not confuse crlEntryExtensions with crlExtensions. 

Let me put together the two paragraphs extracted from X.509 by Martin: 

NOTE 5 -- (...)
         An extension indicated in the crlEntryExtensions field of an entry
shall
         be placed in that entry and shall affect only the certificate(s)
         specified in that entry. 

NOTE 4 -- When an implementation processing a certificate revocation
         list does not recognize a critical extension in the
crlEntryExtensions
         field, it shall assume that, at a minimum, the identified
certificate
         has been revoked and is no longer valid and perform additional
actions
         concerning that revoked certificate as dictated by local policy. 

This validates my text proposal which still is: 

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application 
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". : 

The key question is : which text "makes sense" ? 

Using an example, let us see the implications using a CRL with 5000 entries.


Using the text from X.509, when you look for the revocation status of a
certificate in a CRL you look 
for the serial number of that certificate. If an entry contains that serial
number,  then you look also 
at that crlEntryExtensions (you process it) and you are done with a result. 

Using the text from RFC 5280, when you look for the revocation status of a
certificate in a CRL, you need 
to look at each of the 5000 entries to see if there is a single
crlEntryExtension that 
you don't understand and which is marked critical. If one exists, you can't
determine the revocation status 
of that certificate, even if there is no single critical crlEntryExtension
present in the entry which contains 
the serial number of that certificate. 

The text from X.509 makes sense, while the text from RFC 5280 does not. 

 If we keep the current text from RFC 5280, then RFC 5280 is not compatible
with X.509. 

This is a serious issue. 

Many calls for tenders request "X.509 compatibility" and also request RFC
5280 compatibility for convenience. 
How would it be possible to refer to two documents that are incompatible ?

Russ,

The problem with Denis's proposal is that he wants to replace the text of n=
ot using the CRL.

I have cited a specific example in 5280 itself where an entry extension sco=
pe goes beyond that of the entry.  It potentially impacts subsequent entrie=
s.

Thus, Denis's proposal is unacceptable.  If he just wanted to add the sente=
nce as opposed to replace, it would be fine.

In general, unless 5280 and X.509 stated that an entry extension cannot imp=
act semantics of anything in the CRL other than the entry itself, what you =
say is unacceptable and potentially insecure.

I agree with the proposal that Denis makes.  I support his proposed text.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". :

Santosh:


RFC 5280 describes three CRL Entry Extensions, and all of them come from =
X.509:

	5.3.1.  Reason Code
	5.3.2.  Invalidity Date
	5.3.3.  Certificate Issuer

The first two do not have the concern that you describe, and the third =
one should only be present if the CRL includes the =
IssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension, and that extension includes the =
indirectCRL set to TRUE.  The IssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension =
must be critical.  RFC 5280 says:

   The issuing distribution point is a critical CRL extension that
   identifies the CRL distribution point and scope for a particular CRL,
   and it indicates whether the CRL covers revocation for end entity
   certificates only, CA certificates only, attribute certificates only,
   or a limited set of reason codes.  Although the extension is
   critical, conforming implementations are not required to support this
   extension.  However, implementations that do not support this
   extension MUST either treat the status of any certificate not listed
   on this CRL as unknown or locate another CRL that does not contain
   any unrecognized critical extensions.

To my mind, the support for the critical IssuingDistributionPoint CRL =
extension includes the proper support for the Certificate Issuer CRL =
entry extension.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts director=
ies.
 This draft is a work item of the Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) Working=
 Group of the IETF.

	Title           : DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource=
 Record
	Author(s)       : Phillip Hallam-Baker
                          Rob Stradling

Abstract:
   The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
   allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification
   Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain.
   CAA resource records allow a public Certification Authority to
   implement additional controls to reduce the risk of unintended
   certificate mis-issue.  This document defines the syntax of the CAA
   record and rules for processing CAA records by certificate issuers.

http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-pkix-caa-12.txt

I have made what I hope is most of the edits required in response to
the IESG, APPs and DNS reviews.

The main substantive change here is that the old discovery algorithm
is completely gone and it is replaced with a functional specification
which I hope is more precise and easier to read.

In the process of doing that I removed the language referring to the
issuer authorization set and replaced it with 'relevant CAA record
set' which I hope is easier to follow.


One issue that might be argued over is which order a CA should follow
aliases and search up the chain. As the draft stands is says, follow
the alias first and if that is empty then look in the domain above. I
suspect that it makes no difference which is done provided everyone
does the same thing.

Can you say why? As you said in your later message, only =
CertificateIssuer can be marked critical. The text for that extension =
says:
   CRL issuers MUST mark this extension as critical since an
   implementation that ignored this extension could not correctly
   attribute CRL entries to certificates.  This specification RECOMMENDS
   that implementations recognize this extension.
Your support of Denis' text means that you think that reasoning is =
wrong, and that if an implementation ignored the RECOMMENDS in that last =
sentence, the implementation then doesn't need to pay attention to the =
CertificateIssuer at all.

And, yes, I changed the Subject line. This is not an errata: it is a =
proposed technical change.

It seems to me that a critical extension in a response ought to cause =
the response to be rejected.  If that constitutes an incompatible =
upgrade to the protocol, so be it, but it sounds more like a =

Within the context of OCSP the "object" to be dropped would be an entire =
response, because it's only requested for a single cert?  I have a hard =
time interpreting the meaning of any finer granularity than that.  Or at =
least a hard time finding a good use case for it.

Note 5 seems out of context.

Therefore, a critical extension in the crlEntryExtensions field
of an entry shall affect only the certificate specified in that entry, unle=
ss there is a related critical extension in the
crlExtensions field that advertises a special treatment for it. The only ex=
ample of this situation defined in this
Directory Specification is the certificateIssuer CRL entry extension and th=
e related issuingDistributionPoint CRL
extension when the indirectCRL Boolean from that extension is set to TRUE.

Note 4 specifies minimum action but does not impose any constraints on maxi=
mum.

Based on above  text from X.509 existing text in 5280 seems incorrect (impo=
sing restrictions unconditionally).

However your proposed text would lead to incorrect behavior if a CRL extens=
ion dictates that a CRL entry extension affects more than just the entry in=
 which it is present, a valid scenario according to X.509

Subject: Re: [pkix] Errata in section 5.3 from RFC 5280

Martin,

Your email is quite interesting and I was not thinking that the discussion =
on OCSP would lead
to look at CRLs as defined in  X.509.

Let me first say that RFC  2459 <--> RFC 5280 are supposed to be a *profile=
* of X.509,
which means dropping some of its complexity, but not changing its semantics=
.

RFC  2459 <--> RFC 5280 are clearly changing the semantics of the processin=
g of crlEntryExtensions.

Remainder: do not confuse crlEntryExtensions with crlExtensions.

Let me put together the two paragraphs extracted from X.509 by Martin:

NOTE 5 -- (...)
         An extension indicated in the crlEntryExtensions field of an entry=
 shall
         be placed in that entry and shall affect only the certificate(s)
         specified in that entry.

NOTE 4 -- When an implementation processing a certificate revocation
         list does not recognize a critical extension in the crlEntryExtens=
ions
         field, it shall assume that, at a minimum, the identified certific=
ate
         has been revoked and is no longer valid and perform additional act=
ions
         concerning that revoked certificate as dictated by local policy.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". :

The key question is : which text "makes sense" ?

Using an example, let us see the implications using a CRL with 5000 entries=
.

Using the text from X.509, when you look for the revocation status of a cer=
tificate in a CRL you look
for the serial number of that certificate. If an entry contains that serial=
 number,  then you look also
at that crlEntryExtensions (you process it) and you are done with a result.

Using the text from RFC 5280, when you look for the revocation status of a =
certificate in a CRL, you need
to look at each of the 5000 entries to see if there is a single crlEntryExt=
ension that
you don't understand and which is marked critical. If one exists, you can't=
 determine the revocation status
of that certificate, even if there is no single critical crlEntryExtension =
 present in the entry which contains
the serial number of that certificate.

The text from X.509 makes sense, while the text from RFC 5280 does not.

 If we keep the current text from RFC 5280, then RFC 5280 is not compatible=
 with X.509.

This is a serious issue.

Many calls for tenders request "X.509 compatibility" and also request RFC 5=
280 compatibility for convenience.
How would it be possible to refer to two documents that are incompatible ?

<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">Your email is quite interesting and I was not thinking that the =
discussion on OCSP would lead
</span><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">to look at CRLs as defined in &nbsp;X.509.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">Let me first say that RFC &nbsp;2459 &lt;--&gt; RFC 5280 are sup=
posed to be a *profile* of X.509,
<br>
which means dropping some of its complexity, but not changing its semantics=
.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">RFC &nbsp;2459 &lt;--&gt; RFC 5280 are clearly changing the sema=
ntics of the processing of
</span><tt><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt">crlEntryExtensions.</span></tt>=
 <br>
<br>
<tt><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt">Remainder: do not confuse crlEntryExte=
nsions with crlExtensions.</span></tt>
<br>
<br>
<tt><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt">Let me put together the two paragraphs=
 extracted from X.509 by Martin:</span></tt>
<br>
<br>
<tt><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt">NOTE 5 -- (...)</span></tt><span style=

yExtensions field of an entry shall</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;be placed in that entry and shall aff=
ect only the certificate(s)</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specified in that entry.</tt></span> =

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;has been revoked and is no longer val=
id and perform additional actions</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;concerning that revoked certificate a=
s dictated by local policy.</tt></span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">This validates my text proposal which still is:</span>
<br>
<br>
<tt><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;If a CRL contains a criti=
cal CRL entry extension that the application

<tt>&nbsp; determine the status of this certificate&quot;. </tt></span><spa=

<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=

>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">Using an example, let us see the implications using a CRL with 5=
000 entries.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">Using the text from X.509, when you look for the revocation stat=
us of a certificate in a CRL you look
</span><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=

that serial number, &nbsp;then you look also

lt.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">Using the text from RFC 5280, when you look for the revocation s=
tatus of a certificate in a CRL, you need
</span><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=

the serial number of that certificate.</span> <br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">The text from X.509 makes sense, while the text from RFC 5280 do=
es not.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=
rif&quot;">&nbsp;If we keep the current text from RFC 5280, then RFC 5280 i=
s not compatible with X.509.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=

<br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-se=

<tt>&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &quot;If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension=

br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; I'll note that your suggested replacement would create a security =
problem.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; First of all, this semantic has been present in the spec since rfc=
2459.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; Your suggested change would be backwards-incompatible and affect E=
VERY</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; PKI implementation that implements CRL processing. &nbsp;You simpl=
y</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; can not perform such a change to an installed base at this point i=
n time.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; So I'm opposing your change.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; Curiously, ITU-T X.509 differs from PKIX (rfc2459-&gt;rfc5280) on =
the</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; semantics when encountering an unrecognized critical CrlEntryExten=
sion:</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; (relevant parts prefixed with *&gt;)</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; As you may notice, X.509 does *NOT* specify, that the CRLEntry sho=
uld</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; be ignored when accompanied by a critical CRLEntryExtension. &nbsp=
;It would</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; cause a security problem if it did.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; Quoting from ITU-T Tec. X.509 (08/2005), Section 7.3, top of page =
18:</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;NOTE 4 -- When an implementation processing a certific=
ate revocation</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;list does not recognize a critical extension in the cr=
lEntryExtensions</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;field, it shall assume that, at a minimum, the identif=
ied certificate</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;has been revoked and is no longer valid and perform ad=
ditional actions</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; concerning that revoked certificate as dictated by l=
ocal policy.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; When an implementation does not recognize a critical=
 extension in the</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; crlExtensions field, it shall assume that identified=
 certificates</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; have been revoked and are no longer valid. However i=
n the latter case,</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; since the list may not be complete, certificates tha=
t have not been</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; identified as being revoked cannot be assumed to be =
valid. In this case</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; local policy shall dictate the action to be taken. I=
n any case local</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; policy may dictate actions in addition to and/or str=
onger than those</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; stated in this Specification.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE 5 -- If an extension affects the treatment of t=
he list</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e.g., multiple CRLs need to be scanned to examine t=
he entire list of</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; revoked certificates, or an entry may represent a ra=
nge of certificates),</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; then that extension shall be indicated as critical i=
n the crlExtensions</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; field regardless of where the extension is placed in=
 the CRL.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;An extension indicated in the crlEntryExtensions field=
 of an entry shall</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;be placed in that entry and shall affect only the cert=
ificate(s)</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; *&gt; &nbsp;specified in that entry.</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; </tt><br>
<tt>&gt; Although I find the original X.509 semantics for processing</tt><b=
r>
<tt>&gt; CRLEntryExtensions much more reasonable than what rfc2459-&gt;rfc5=
280 says,</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; I firmly believe that as IETF we can not retroactively change the<=
/tt><br>
<tt>&gt; semantics for processing critical CRLEntryExtensions for</tt><br>
<tt>&gt; rfc2459-&gt;rfc5280 &amp; implementations based on these (proposed=

+1.

And X.509 makes it clear that a CRL extension can be used to indicate if CR=
L entry extension affects more than just the entry in which it is present.
So Denis's proposal is applicable only in cases where such CRL extensions (=
e.g idp with indirectCRl set to true) are not present.

Russ,

The problem with Denis's proposal is that he wants to replace the text of n=
ot using the CRL.

I have cited a specific example in 5280 itself where an entry extension sco=
pe goes beyond that of the entry.  It potentially impacts subsequent entrie=
s.

Thus, Denis's proposal is unacceptable.  If he just wanted to add the sente=
nce as opposed to replace, it would be fine.

In general, unless 5280 and X.509 stated that an entry extension cannot imp=
act semantics of anything in the CRL other than the entry itself, what you =
say is unacceptable and potentially insecure.

I agree with the proposal that Denis makes.  I support his proposed text.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". :

Russ,

If we buy your argument for a minute, whether we change the text or not doe=
s not matter based on your assertion below.  To paraphrase what you say bel=
ow, those who process IDP will process certificate issuer and those who do =
not process IDP will reject the CRL because of critical CRL extension.  Sin=
ce it does not matter, status quo is the best course.

As Piyush Jain has pointed out in this thread, if 5280 wants to use X.509 t=
ext, we may be able come to some agreement..

My concern is not the extensions listed in 5280.  X.509 V3 is extensible be=
cause you can define additional extensions.  The criticality processing/enf=

Santosh:


RFC 5280 describes three CRL Entry Extensions, and all of them come from X.=
509:

            5.3.1.  Reason Code
            5.3.2.  Invalidity Date
            5.3.3.  Certificate Issuer

The first two do not have the concern that you describe, and the third one =
should only be present if the CRL includes the IssuingDistributionPoint CRL=
 extension, and that extension includes the indirectCRL set to TRUE.  The I=
ssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension must be critical.  RFC 5280 says:

   The issuing distribution point is a critical CRL extension that
   identifies the CRL distribution point and scope for a particular CRL,
   and it indicates whether the CRL covers revocation for end entity
   certificates only, CA certificates only, attribute certificates only,
   or a limited set of reason codes.  Although the extension is
   critical, conforming implementations are not required to support this
   extension.  However, implementations that do not support this
   extension MUST either treat the status of any certificate not listed
   on this CRL as unknown or locate another CRL that does not contain
   any unrecognized critical extensions.

To my mind, the support for the critical IssuingDistributionPoint CRL exten=
sion includes the proper support for the Certificate Issuer CRL entry exten=
sion.

Russ,

The problem with Denis's proposal is that he wants to replace the text of n=
ot using the CRL.

I have cited a specific example in 5280 itself where an entry extension sco=
pe goes beyond that of the entry.  It potentially impacts subsequent entrie=
s.

Thus, Denis's proposal is unacceptable.  If he just wanted to add the sente=
nce as opposed to replace, it would be fine.

In general, unless 5280 and X.509 stated that an entry extension cannot imp=
act semantics of anything in the CRL other than the entry itself, what you =
say is unacceptable and potentially insecure.

I agree with the proposal that Denis makes.  I support his proposed text.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". :

Denis,

I believe that the semantics of OCSP responses with unrecognized critical
extensions are effectively undefined in rfc2560 so that their use ought
to be avoided.

I believe that for the purpose of conveying information about cert
existence/non-existence in an OCSP response, non-critical
(entry)extensions will be perfectly sufficient.

It may be easier to discuss the issues by drilling down into
the details.

What needs to be accounted for is (a) what answer is best suited
for the OCSP requestor, and (b) can the OCSP response confuse
other RPs who obtain that response from caching, stapling, proxying,
or from a malicious attacker?


Traditional OCSP:
                                           rfc2560 response:
   issuer+serial refer to 
     (1)  real cert that is valid                 good
     (2)  real cert that is revoked             revoked
     (3)  non-existent cert                       good


Having the OCSP responder add the certificate hash of
the REAL cert into a non-critical singleResponse extension
for (1) and (2) should be safe according to rfc2560, _independent_
of which RP is going to process the repsonse.

The whitelisting check that were discussing (comparing the
hash of the cert that an RP is checking for revocation against
the records of issued certs applies in theory to all three
scenarios above.  However, we ought to leave the ocsp responses
semantics of (1) and (2) alone, and only modify the response (3).

It would be dangerous to have an OCSP responder create a
response with an rfc2560 CertID refering to a valid,
unrevoked issued cert, accompanied by an incorrect cert
hash in a singleResponse extensions and a revoked status,
because the installed base does not understand the semantics
of such a beast and it has a potential to be misunderstood.


For (1) and (2), I (finally) agree with you Denis, for
rfc2560 CertIDs refering to real issued certs, the OCSP response
ought to convey the true status (good/revoked) and a whitelist-enabled
OCSP responser should include the true hash of the issued cert in
a non-critical OCSP singleResponseExtension, and the RP must be
burdened with comparing the hash of the real cert with the hash
of the cert the RP is verifying. 


What about situation (3).  I do not see a problem with an OCSP
responder who has access to a white list or issue records to
return "revoked (on hold)" to discourage the RP from trusting
this cert.  But the validity of such a "denial-of-existance"
OCSP response should be extremely short (to minimize interference
with real certs that get issued shortly after such an OCSP response
is created) similar how negative DNS responses ought to be short-lived.
And such a "negative" OCSP response ought NOT to contain any cert hash
in a singleResponse extension--the presence of a cert hash in the
response should be limited to correct hashes of isssued certs.


It's true that there is no need for the OCSP resquest to convey
a cert hash to make the above happen.  The purpose of a cert hash
in the requst is really more about allowing an OCSP responder
to detect when there are potentially fraudulently issued certs
being used that the CA does not know about.  I agree that it will be
easy to create the impression of fraudulent cert usage by submitting
OCSP requests for real certs accompanied by random hash values,
so OCSP operators need to be careful about interpreting the
collected data.  But I do not see this as a problem.

The real problem is this:

A critical crlEntryExtension is IMHO semantical non-sense, saying:

"A certificate is revoked, but only under the following constraints --
 and if you don't understand this, consider the certificate valid".

The guidance in X.509 is, that the criticality is to be ignored and
the cert to which the CrlEntry refers must be considered revoked.
And X.509 says that the creators of the non-sense ought to include
a critical CRLExtension instead.  this is what the beginning of
Note 5 from X.509 08/2005 section 7.3, page 18 is about:

    NOTE 5 -- If an extension affects the treatment of the list
    (e.g., multiple CRLs need to be scanned to examine the entire list of
    revoked certificates, or an entry may represent a range of certificates),
    then that extension shall be indicated as critical in the crlExtensions
    field regardless of where the extension is placed in the CRL.


rfc5280 "enforces" the latter guidance in its own fashion: a critical
crlEntryExtension would have to accompanied by a critical crlExtension
per X.509, and if it is unrecognized, then the whole CRL must be rejected
as if this has been an unrecognized critical crlExtension (which per
X.509 should have been there in the first place).


For an implementation, however the rfc5280 description is much harder
to implement.  It is not unusal that the ASN.1 parser and the
code that processes the objects (e.g. CRL checking) are seperate
and independently maintaind.  Potentially, the ASN.1 parser could
even be compiler-generated, so that it could happen that a
crlEntryExtension is not "unrecognized" for the ASN.1 Parser,
but unrecognized for the code that performs CRL acutal checking.

The rfc5280 definition implies, that in such a case the CRL checking
code must scan the entire CRL (all entries) in order to ensure that
there are no critical unrecognized crlEntryExtensions.

Not sure if I understand the basis for this interpretation.  Did you type "=
valid" instead of "unknown" accidentally?

Only in some situations.

Indirect CRLs are defined in X.509. So I doubt that the authors of X.509 co=
nsidered it nonsense. In hindsight, based on adoption of indirect CRLs, you=
 can probably say that indirectCRLs are not useful but "nonsense" is little=
 strong.

Agreed. I think that carrying over X.509 text to 5280 is the right approach=
 to address this.

I haven't read the draft yet (I will), but in this matter, if that's
what the draft says it is certainly the only correct thing to say.

As a straightforward DNS matter, the alias _will_ be chased first.  So
it wouldn't be possible to climb the tree first, because when you run
into a CNAME (or a DNAME at the parent), you start substitution.

Best,

situations which happened after thisUpdate time was not covered in OCSP =
response status.

Online systems are based on probability where when something was true =
recently it is expected that it is true also now when the online service =
is used and for that reason thisUpdate of OCSP response is ignored. For =
that reason OCSP response containing hash of certificate must be =
processed together with the value included in thisUpdate to prevent it =
from situations which you have described.

For the long term validation thisUpdate time value of OCSP response (or =
CRL) must be always before the time in the past to which the validation =
is realized e.g. signature validation or other investigation of X.509 =
PKI usage in the past.

Subject: Re: [pkix] Use of the OSCP unknown response

Denis,

I believe that the semantics of OCSP responses with unrecognized =
critical
extensions are effectively undefined in rfc2560 so that their use ought
to be avoided.

I believe that for the purpose of conveying information about cert
existence/non-existence in an OCSP response, non-critical
(entry)extensions will be perfectly sufficient.

It may be easier to discuss the issues by drilling down into
the details.

What needs to be accounted for is (a) what answer is best suited
for the OCSP requestor, and (b) can the OCSP response confuse
other RPs who obtain that response from caching, stapling, proxying,
or from a malicious attacker?


Traditional OCSP:
                                           rfc2560 response:
   issuer+serial refer to=20
     (1)  real cert that is valid                 good
     (2)  real cert that is revoked             revoked
     (3)  non-existent cert                       good


Having the OCSP responder add the certificate hash of
the REAL cert into a non-critical singleResponse extension
for (1) and (2) should be safe according to rfc2560, _independent_
of which RP is going to process the repsonse.

The whitelisting check that were discussing (comparing the
hash of the cert that an RP is checking for revocation against
the records of issued certs applies in theory to all three
scenarios above.  However, we ought to leave the ocsp responses
semantics of (1) and (2) alone, and only modify the response (3).

It would be dangerous to have an OCSP responder create a
response with an rfc2560 CertID refering to a valid,
unrevoked issued cert, accompanied by an incorrect cert
hash in a singleResponse extensions and a revoked status,
because the installed base does not understand the semantics
of such a beast and it has a potential to be misunderstood.


For (1) and (2), I (finally) agree with you Denis, for
rfc2560 CertIDs refering to real issued certs, the OCSP response
ought to convey the true status (good/revoked) and a whitelist-enabled
OCSP responser should include the true hash of the issued cert in
a non-critical OCSP singleResponseExtension, and the RP must be
burdened with comparing the hash of the real cert with the hash
of the cert the RP is verifying.=20


What about situation (3).  I do not see a problem with an OCSP
responder who has access to a white list or issue records to
return "revoked (on hold)" to discourage the RP from trusting
this cert.  But the validity of such a "denial-of-existance"
OCSP response should be extremely short (to minimize interference
with real certs that get issued shortly after such an OCSP response
is created) similar how negative DNS responses ought to be short-lived.
And such a "negative" OCSP response ought NOT to contain any cert hash
in a singleResponse extension--the presence of a cert hash in the
response should be limited to correct hashes of isssued certs.


It's true that there is no need for the OCSP resquest to convey
a cert hash to make the above happen.  The purpose of a cert hash
in the requst is really more about allowing an OCSP responder
to detect when there are potentially fraudulently issued certs
being used that the CA does not know about.  I agree that it will be
easy to create the impression of fraudulent cert usage by submitting
OCSP requests for real certs accompanied by random hash values,
so OCSP operators need to be careful about interpreting the
collected data.  But I do not see this as a problem.

The semantics has already been changed regarding trust anchor and validatio=
n.

CRL Processing (6.3.3) step (f) is incompatible with =C2=A78.1.5 of X.509
on self-issued certificates, for example.

Trust anchor renewal as processed by RFC5280 is a problem on current
CSCA deployments.

Message en plusieurs parties au format MIME

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

The discussion about the crlEntryExtensions lead me to read again sections 
4.1.2.9 
and 4.2 from RFC 5280.

Section 4.2 has originally been written only in the context of certificate 
extensions, whereas 
extensions are now used by many other RFCs (in particular RFC 2560, which 
import the Extensions 
syntax and hence its description).

The current text needs to be "clarified". 

I have  reshuffled the text to separate the definition of "extensions", 
used by RFCs 
(including RFC 5280 and RFC 2560) from the definition of  "certificate 
extensions".

Basically, the text which was specific to "certificate extensions" has 
been moved into section 4.2.1.

Section 4.2 which is called "Certificates Extensions" has been renamed 
"Extensions".
It is specific to extensions which are used by any  RFC which wants to use 
the syntax and its meaning.
All the relationships with "certificate extensions" have been removed in 
the new section 4.2.

You will find here after the (1) new proposed text, (2) the current text, 
and (3) an extract from X.509.

NEW PROPOSED TEXT:

4.1.2.9.  Extensions

   This field MUST only appear if the version is 3 (Section 4.1.2.1).
   If present, this field is a SEQUENCE of one or more extensions. 
   The format and content of the extensions field are defined in 
   section 4.2.

4.2.  Extensions

   The extensions field allows addition of new fields to a structure 
   without modification to the ASN.1 definition.  An extension field 
   consists of an extension identifier, a criticality flag, and an 
   encoding of a data value of an ASN.1 type associated with the 
   identified extension. 

   Each extension includes an OID and an ASN.1 structure.  When an
   extension appears in a structure , the OID appears as the field
   extnID and the corresponding ASN.1 DER encoded structure is the 
   value of the octet string extnValue.  A SEQUENCE MUST NOT include 
   more than one instance of a particular extension. 

   For those extensions where ordering of individual extensions within 
   the SEQUENCE is significant, the specification of those individual 
   extensions shall include the rules for the significance of the order 
   therein. 

   An extension includes the boolean critical, with a default value of 
   FALSE.  The text for each extension specifies the acceptable values 
   for the critical field for implementations conforming to this 
   profile.

   A processing system MUST reject the content of the SEQUENCE where 
   the extension appears if it encounters a critical extension it does 
   not recognize or a critical extension that contains information that 
   it cannot process. 

   A non-critical extension MUST be processed if it is recognized and 
   MAY be ignored if it is not recognized.

   Note that any extension that is flagged non-critical will cause 
   inconsistent behaviour between processing systems that will process 
   the extension and processing systems that do not recognize the 
   extension and will ignore it. 

 
4.2.1.  Standard Extensions

   The following sections present recommended extensions used within 
   Internet certificates and standard locations for information. 

   Communities may elect to use additional extensions; however, 
   caution ought to be exercised in adopting any critical extensions 
   in certificates that might prevent use in a general context.

   The extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates provide methods for
   associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for
   managing relationships between CAs.  The X.509 v3 certificate format
   also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
   information unique to those communities. 

   Conforming CAs MUST support key identifiers (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), key usage (Section
   4.2.1.3), and certificate policies (Section 4.2.1.4) extensions.  If
   the CA issues certificates with an empty sequence for the subject 
   field, the CA MUST support the subject alternative name extension
   (Section 4.2.1.6).  Support for the remaining extensions is OPTIONAL.
   Conforming CAs MAY support extensions that are not identified within
   this specification; certificate issuers are cautioned that marking
   such extensions as critical may inhibit interoperability.

   At a minimum, applications conforming to this profile MUST recognize
   the following extensions: key usage (Section 4.2.1.3), certificate
   policies (Section 4.2.1.4), subject alternative name (Section
   4.2.1.6), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), name constraints
   (Section 4.2.1.10), policy constraints (Section 4.2.1.11), extended
   key usage (Section 4.2.1.12), and inhibit anyPolicy (Section
   4.2.1.14).

   In addition, applications conforming to this profile SHOULD recognize
   the authority and subject key identifier (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2) and policy mappings (Section 4.2.1.5) extensions.

   This section identifies standard certificate extensions defined in
   [X.509] for use in the Internet PKI. 

 CURRENT  TEXT:

4.1.2.9.  Extensions
   This field MUST only appear if the version is 3 (Section 4.1.2.1).
   If present, this field is a SEQUENCE of one or more certificate
   extensions.  The format and content of certificate extensions in the
   Internet PKI are defined in Section 4.2.

4.2.  Certificate Extensions

   The extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates provide methods for
   associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for
   managing relationships between CAs.  The X.509 v3 certificate format
   also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
   information unique to those communities.  Each extension in a
   certificate is designated as either critical or non-critical.  A
   certificate-using system MUST reject the certificate if it encounters
   a critical extension it does not recognize or a critical extension
   that contains information that it cannot process.  A non-critical
   extension MAY be ignored if it is not recognized, but MUST be
   processed if it is recognized.  The following sections present
   recommended extensions used within Internet certificates and standard
   locations for information.  Communities may elect to use additional
   extensions; however, caution ought to be exercised in adopting any
   critical extensions in certificates that might prevent use in a
   general context.

   Each extension includes an OID and an ASN.1 structure.  When an
   extension appears in a certificate, the OID appears as the field
   extnID and the corresponding ASN.1 DER encoded structure is the value
   of the octet string extnValue.  A certificate MUST NOT include more
   than one instance of a particular extension.  For example, a
   certificate may contain only one authority key identifier extension
   (Section 4.2.1.1).  An extension includes the boolean critical, with
   a default value of FALSE.  The text for each extension specifies the
   acceptable values for the critical field for CAs conforming to this
   profile.

   Conforming CAs MUST support key identifiers (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), key usage (Section
   4.2.1.3), and certificate policies (Section 4.2.1.4) extensions.  If
   the CA issues certificates with an empty sequence for the subject
   field, the CA MUST support the subject alternative name extension
   (Section 4.2.1.6).  Support for the remaining extensions is OPTIONAL.
   Conforming CAs MAY support extensions that are not identified within
   this specification; certificate issuers are cautioned that marking
   such extensions as critical may inhibit interoperability.

   At a minimum, applications conforming to this profile MUST recognize
   the following extensions: key usage (Section 4.2.1.3), certificate
   policies (Section 4.2.1.4), subject alternative name (Section
   4.2.1.6), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), name constraints
   (Section 4.2.1.10), policy constraints (Section 4.2.1.11), extended
   key usage (Section 4.2.1.12), and inhibit anyPolicy (Section
   4.2.1.14).

   In addition, applications conforming to this profile SHOULD recognize
   the authority and subject key identifier (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2) and policy mappings (Section 4.2.1.5) extensions.

4.2.1.  Standard Extensions

   This section identifies standard certificate extensions defined in
   [X.509] for use in the Internet PKI. 


EXTRACT FROM X.509 page 14:

The extensions field allows addition of new fields to the structure 
without modification to the ASN.1 definition. 
An extension field consists of an extension identifier, a criticality 
flag, and an encoding of a data value of 
an ASN.1 type associated with the identified extension. 

For those extensions where ordering of individual extensions within the 
SEQUENCE is significant, 
the specification of those individual extensions shall include the rules 
for the significance of the order therein. 

When an implementation processing a certificate does not recognize an 
extension, if the criticality flag is FALSE, 
it may ignore that extension. If the criticality flag is TRUE, 
unrecognized extensions shall cause the structure 
to be considered invalid, i.e., in a certificate, an unrecognized critical 
extension would cause validation of 
a signature using that certificate to fail. 

When a certificate-using implementation recognizes and is able to process 
an extension, then the 
certificate-using implementation shall process the extension regardless of 
the value of the criticality flag. 

Note that any extension that is flagged non-critical will cause 
inconsistent behaviour between certificate-using 
systems that will process the extension and certificate-using systems that 
do not recognize the extension and will ignore it. 

If unknown elements appear within the extension, and the extension is not 
marked critical, those unknown elements 
shall be ignored according to the rules of extensibility documented in 
12.2.2 in ITU-T Rec. X.519 | ISO/IEC 9594-5.

Russ, I realize the RFC 5280 references the 2005 edition of X.509. However =
the 2009 edition (freely available at http://www.x500standard.com/index.php=
?n=3DIg.LatestAvail ) revises this text again slightly and I think makes th=
e intent even clearer. It states (as part of the main text and no longer a =
note):

If an extension affects the treatment of the list (e.g., multiple CRLs need=
 to be scanned to examine the entire list of revoked certificates, or an en=
try may represent a range of certificates), then either that extension or a=
 related extension shall be indicated as critical in the crlExtensions fiel=
d. Therefore, a critical extension in the crlEntryExtensions field of an en=
try shall affect only the certificate specified in that entry, unless there=
 is a related critical extension in the crlExtensions field that advertises=
 a special treatment for it. The only example of this situation defined in =
this Specification is the certificateIssuer CRL entry extension and the rel=
ated issuingDistributionPoint CRL extension when the indirectCRL Boolean fr=
om that extension is set to TRUE.


This is clearly the case for certificateIssuer as you indicate below and as=
 you note below the only other 2 standard crl entry extensions are irreleva=
nt as they can only ever be non-critical and affect only the single identif=
ied revoked certificate. Any private extension that might be defined as a c=
rlEntry extension would also have to follow that same rule to be compliant =
with the base standard. I do believe the 2005 text was clear but offer this=
 2009 as additional confirmation of the intent (I personally find this text=
 even clearer).

Cheers,
Sharon

Santosh:


RFC 5280 describes three CRL Entry Extensions, and all of them come from X.=
509:

            5.3.1.  Reason Code
            5.3.2.  Invalidity Date
            5.3.3.  Certificate Issuer

The first two do not have the concern that you describe, and the third one =
should only be present if the CRL includes the IssuingDistributionPoint CRL=
 extension, and that extension includes the indirectCRL set to TRUE.  The I=
ssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension must be critical.  RFC 5280 says:

   The issuing distribution point is a critical CRL extension that
   identifies the CRL distribution point and scope for a particular CRL,
   and it indicates whether the CRL covers revocation for end entity
   certificates only, CA certificates only, attribute certificates only,
   or a limited set of reason codes.  Although the extension is
   critical, conforming implementations are not required to support this
   extension.  However, implementations that do not support this
   extension MUST either treat the status of any certificate not listed
   on this CRL as unknown or locate another CRL that does not contain
   any unrecognized critical extensions.

To my mind, the support for the critical IssuingDistributionPoint CRL exten=
sion includes the proper support for the Certificate Issuer CRL entry exten=
sion.

Russ,

The problem with Denis's proposal is that he wants to replace the text of n=
ot using the CRL.

I have cited a specific example in 5280 itself where an entry extension sco=
pe goes beyond that of the entry.  It potentially impacts subsequent entrie=
s.

Thus, Denis's proposal is unacceptable.  If he just wanted to add the sente=
nce as opposed to replace, it would be fine.

In general, unless 5280 and X.509 stated that an entry extension cannot imp=
act semantics of anything in the CRL other than the entry itself, what you =
say is unacceptable and potentially insecure.

I agree with the proposal that Denis makes.  I support his proposed text.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". :

How do you believe the clarifications document should change to express =
this point?

Denis,

I think your proposal is based on the assumption that existing text in sect=
ion 4.1.2.9 applies to "type" Extensions as opposed to "instance" of Extens=
ions within structure TBSCertificates.

This assumption may not be correct because in later sections 5280 re- defin=
es what Extensions mean in context of a CRL and in context of CRL entry.
Your proposal would certainly require changes in 5.1.2.7 and 5.2.

Also, your proposed text for Extension imposes restrictions on how other sp=
ecifications can use this structure.  Please see inline for additional comm=
ents
From: pkix-bounces@ietf.org [mailto:pkix-bounces@ietf.org] On Behalf Of den=

Subject: [pkix] Clarifications in section 4.2 from RFC 5280

The discussion about the crlEntryExtensions lead me to read again sections =
4.1.2.9
and 4.2 from RFC 5280.

Section 4.2 has originally been written only in the context of certificate =
extensions, whereas
extensions are now used by many other RFCs (in particular RFC 2560, which i=
mport the Extensions
syntax and hence its description).

[piyush] The description in 4.2 applies specifically to extensions in conte=
xt of tbsCertificates.

The current text needs to be "clarified".

I have  reshuffled the text to separate the definition of "extensions", use=
d by RFCs
(including RFC 5280 and RFC 2560) from the definition of  "certificate exte=
nsions".

Basically, the text which was specific to "certificate extensions" has been=
 moved into section 4.2.1.

Section 4.2 which is called "Certificates Extensions" has been renamed  "Ex=
tensions".
It is specific to extensions which are used by any  RFC which wants to use =
the syntax and its meaning.
All the relationships with "certificate extensions" have been removed in th=
e new section 4.2.
[piyush] exisiting 4.2 applies  to certificate extension. It does not apply=
 to any other extensions (CRL, Crl Entry or extensions used in 2560, 5055 o=
r any other ARFC). Even within 5280 there are separate sections to define w=
hat "Extensions" means in context of CRLs and CRL entries.


You will find here after the (1) new proposed text, (2) the current text, a=
nd (3) an extract from X.509.

NEW PROPOSED TEXT:

4.1.2.9.  Extensions

   This field MUST only appear if the version is 3 (Section 4.1.2.1).
   If present, this field is a SEQUENCE of one or more extensions.
   The format and content of the extensions field are defined in
   section 4.2.

4.2.  Extensions

   The extensions field allows addition of new fields to a structure
   without modification to the ASN.1 definition.  An extension field
   consists of an extension identifier, a criticality flag, and an
   encoding of a data value of an ASN.1 type associated with the
   identified extension.

   Each extension includes an OID and an ASN.1 structure.  When an
   extension appears in a structure , the OID appears as the field
   extnID and the corresponding ASN.1 DER encoded structure is the
   value of the octet string extnValue.  A SEQUENCE MUST NOT include
   more than one instance of a particular extension.

[piyush] There could be scenarios outside 5280 where more than one instance=
 of same extensions in a sequence are useful.

   For those extensions where ordering of individual extensions within
   the SEQUENCE is significant, the specification of those individual
   extensions shall include the rules for the significance of the order
   therein.

   An extension includes the boolean critical, with a default value of
   FALSE.  The text for each extension specifies the acceptable values
   for the critical field for implementations conforming to this
   profile.

   A processing system MUST reject the content of the SEQUENCE where
   the extension appears if it encounters a critical extension it does
   not recognize or a critical extension that contains information that
   it cannot process.
[piyush] which SEQUENCE ? immediate parent or the top level SEQUENCE? I thi=
nk it depends on the extension that is being defined.


   A non-critical extension MUST be processed if it is recognized and
   MAY be ignored if it is not recognized.

[piyush] It is relevant in context of 5280 but other specifications should =
be free to define their own processing rules.

   Note that any extension that is flagged non-critical will cause
   inconsistent behaviour between processing systems that will process
   the extension and processing systems that do not recognize the
   extension and will ignore it.


4.2.1.  Standard Extensions

   The following sections present recommended extensions used within
   Internet certificates and standard locations for information.

   Communities may elect to use additional extensions; however,
   caution ought to be exercised in adopting any critical extensions
   in certificates that might prevent use in a general context.

   The extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates provide methods for
   associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for
   managing relationships between CAs.  The X.509 v3 certificate format
   also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
   information unique to those communities.

   Conforming CAs MUST support key identifiers (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), key usage (Section
   4.2.1.3), and certificate policies (Section 4.2.1.4) extensions.  If
   the CA issues certificates with an empty sequence for the subject
   field, the CA MUST support the subject alternative name extension
   (Section 4.2.1.6).  Support for the remaining extensions is OPTIONAL.
   Conforming CAs MAY support extensions that are not identified within
   this specification; certificate issuers are cautioned that marking
   such extensions as critical may inhibit interoperability.

   At a minimum, applications conforming to this profile MUST recognize
   the following extensions: key usage (Section 4.2.1.3), certificate
   policies (Section 4.2.1.4), subject alternative name (Section
   4.2.1.6), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), name constraints
   (Section 4.2.1.10), policy constraints (Section 4.2.1.11), extended
   key usage (Section 4.2.1.12), and inhibit anyPolicy (Section
   4.2.1.14).

   In addition, applications conforming to this profile SHOULD recognize
   the authority and subject key identifier (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2) and policy mappings (Section 4.2.1.5) extensions.

   This section identifies standard certificate extensions defined in
   [X.509] for use in the Internet PKI.

 CURRENT  TEXT:

4.1.2.9.  Extensions
   This field MUST only appear if the version is 3 (Section 4.1.2.1).
   If present, this field is a SEQUENCE of one or more certificate
   extensions.  The format and content of certificate extensions in the
   Internet PKI are defined in Section 4.2.

4.2.  Certificate Extensions

   The extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates provide methods for
   associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for
   managing relationships between CAs.  The X.509 v3 certificate format
   also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
   information unique to those communities.  Each extension in a
   certificate is designated as either critical or non-critical.  A
   certificate-using system MUST reject the certificate if it encounters
   a critical extension it does not recognize or a critical extension
   that contains information that it cannot process.  A non-critical
   extension MAY be ignored if it is not recognized, but MUST be
   processed if it is recognized.  The following sections present
   recommended extensions used within Internet certificates and standard
   locations for information.  Communities may elect to use additional
   extensions; however, caution ought to be exercised in adopting any
   critical extensions in certificates that might prevent use in a
   general context.

   Each extension includes an OID and an ASN.1 structure.  When an
   extension appears in a certificate, the OID appears as the field
   extnID and the corresponding ASN.1 DER encoded structure is the value
   of the octet string extnValue.  A certificate MUST NOT include more
   than one instance of a particular extension.  For example, a
   certificate may contain only one authority key identifier extension
   (Section 4.2.1.1).  An extension includes the boolean critical, with
   a default value of FALSE.  The text for each extension specifies the
   acceptable values for the critical field for CAs conforming to this
   profile.

   Conforming CAs MUST support key identifiers (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), key usage (Section
   4.2.1.3), and certificate policies (Section 4.2.1.4) extensions.  If
   the CA issues certificates with an empty sequence for the subject
   field, the CA MUST support the subject alternative name extension
   (Section 4.2.1.6).  Support for the remaining extensions is OPTIONAL.
   Conforming CAs MAY support extensions that are not identified within
   this specification; certificate issuers are cautioned that marking
   such extensions as critical may inhibit interoperability.

   At a minimum, applications conforming to this profile MUST recognize
   the following extensions: key usage (Section 4.2.1.3), certificate
   policies (Section 4.2.1.4), subject alternative name (Section
   4.2.1.6), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), name constraints
   (Section 4.2.1.10), policy constraints (Section 4.2.1.11), extended
   key usage (Section 4.2.1.12), and inhibit anyPolicy (Section
   4.2.1.14).

   In addition, applications conforming to this profile SHOULD recognize
   the authority and subject key identifier (Sections 4.2.1.1 and
   4.2.1.2) and policy mappings (Section 4.2.1.5) extensions.

4.2.1.  Standard Extensions

   This section identifies standard certificate extensions defined in
   [X.509] for use in the Internet PKI.


EXTRACT FROM X.509 page 14:

The extensions field allows addition of new fields to the structure without=
 modification to the ASN.1 definition.
An extension field consists of an extension identifier, a criticality flag,=
 and an encoding of a data value of
an ASN.1 type associated with the identified extension.

For those extensions where ordering of individual extensions within the SEQ=
UENCE is significant,
the specification of those individual extensions shall include the rules fo=
r the significance of the order therein.

When an implementation processing a certificate does not recognize an exten=
sion, if the criticality flag is FALSE,
it may ignore that extension. If the criticality flag is TRUE, unrecognized=
 extensions shall cause the structure
to be considered invalid, i.e., in a certificate, an unrecognized critical =
extension would cause validation of
a signature using that certificate to fail.

When a certificate-using implementation recognizes and is able to process a=
n extension, then the
certificate-using implementation shall process the extension regardless of =
the value of the criticality flag.

Note that any extension that is flagged non-critical will cause inconsisten=
t behaviour between certificate-using
systems that will process the extension and certificate-using systems that =
do not recognize the extension and will ignore it.

If unknown elements appear within the extension, and the extension is not m=
arked critical, those unknown elements
shall be ignored according to the rules of extensibility documented in 12.2=
.2 in ITU-T Rec. X.519 | ISO/IEC 9594-5.

I think the easiest way to clarify it would be:


a)      In the penultimate sentence of the first paragraph of 5.3 replace "=
status of any certificate" with "status of this certificate"

b)      Add a new second paragraph in 5.3 that states "If an extension affe=
cts the treatment of the list (e.g., multiple CRLs need to be scanned to ex=
amine the entire list of revoked certificates, or an entry may represent a =
range of certificates), then either that extension or a related extension s=
hall be indicated as critical in the crlExtensionsfield. Therefore, a criti=
cal extension in the crlEntryExtensions field of an entry shall affect only=
 the certificate specified in that entry, unless there is a related critica=
l extension in the crlExtensions field that advertises a special treatment =
for it."

Russ, I realize the RFC 5280 references the 2005 edition of X.509. However =
the 2009 edition (freely available athttp://www.x500standard.com/index.php?=

 intent even clearer. It states (as part of the main text and no longer a n=
ote):

If an extension affects the treatment of the list (e.g., multiple CRLs need=
 to be scanned to examine the entire list of revoked certificates, or an en=
try may represent a range of certificates), then either that extension or a=

a special treatment for it. The only example of this situation defined in t=
his Specification is the certificateIssuer CRL entry extension and the rela=
ted issuingDistributionPoint CRL extension when theindirectCRL Boolean from=
 that extension is set to TRUE.


This is clearly the case for certificateIssuer as you indicate below and as=
 you note below the only other 2 standard crl entry extensions are irreleva=
nt as they can only ever be non-critical and affect only the single identif=
ied revoked certificate. Any private extension that might be defined as a c=
rlEntry extension would also have to follow that same rule to be compliant =
with the base standard. I do believe the 2005 text was clear but offer this=
 2009 as additional confirmation of the intent (I personally find this text=
 even clearer).

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [pkix] Errata in section 5.3 from RFC 5280

Santosh:


RFC 5280 describes three CRL Entry Extensions, and all of them come from X.=
509:

            5.3.1.  Reason Code
            5.3.2.  Invalidity Date
            5.3.3.  Certificate Issuer

The first two do not have the concern that you describe, and the third one =
should only be present if the CRL includes the IssuingDistributionPoint CRL=
 extension, and that extension includes the indirectCRL set to TRUE.  The I=
ssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension must be critical.  RFC 5280 says:

   The issuing distribution point is a critical CRL extension that
   identifies the CRL distribution point and scope for a particular CRL,
   and it indicates whether the CRL covers revocation for end entity
   certificates only, CA certificates only, attribute certificates only,
   or a limited set of reason codes.  Although the extension is
   critical, conforming implementations are not required to support this
   extension.  However, implementations that do not support this
   extension MUST either treat the status of any certificate not listed
   on this CRL as unknown or locate another CRL that does not contain
   any unrecognized critical extensions.

To my mind, the support for the critical IssuingDistributionPoint CRL exten=
sion includes the proper support for the Certificate Issuer CRL entry exten=
sion.

Russ,

The problem with Denis's proposal is that he wants to replace the text of n=
ot using the CRL.

I have cited a specific example in 5280 itself where an entry extension sco=
pe goes beyond that of the entry.  It potentially impacts subsequent entrie=
s.

Thus, Denis's proposal is unacceptable.  If he just wanted to add the sente=
nce as opposed to replace, it would be fine.

In general, unless 5280 and X.509 stated that an entry extension cannot imp=
act semantics of anything in the CRL other than the entry itself, what you =
say is unacceptable and potentially insecure.

I agree with the proposal that Denis makes.  I support his proposed text.

This validates my text proposal which still is:

   If a CRL contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application
  cannot process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to
  determine the status of this certificate". :

Denis,

PKIX supports the 1st part (partitioned & delta CRLs) of the eg but not 
the 2nd part (CRL scope extension) so we could we just remove the ", or 
an entry may represent a range of certificates" from the parenthetical?

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts director=
ies.
 This draft is a work item of the Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) Working=
 Group of the IETF.

	Title           : DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource=
 Record
	Author(s)       : Phillip Hallam-Baker
                          Rob Stradling
	Filename        : draft-ietf-pkix-caa-13.txt

	Date            : 2012-08-28

Abstract:
   The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
   allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification
   Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain.
   CAA resource records allow a public Certification Authority to
   implement additional controls to reduce the risk of unintended
   certificate mis-issue.  This document defines the syntax of the CAA
   record and rules for processing CAA records by certificate issuers.

A new Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.

    Title         : X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure Online 
Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP
    Author(s)     : D. Pinkas
    Filename      : draft-pinkas-rfc2560bis
    Pages         : 41 
    Date          : Aug. 27, 2012 
 
   This document specifies a protocol useful in determining the current
   status of a digital certificate without requiring CRLs.  Additional
   mechanisms addressing PKIX operational requirements are specified in
   separate documents. This document obsoletes RFC 2560 and RFC 6277.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pinkas-rfc2560bis-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP at:
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation 
to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft.

<ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pinkas-rfc2560bis> 

A few explanations about the content of draft-ietf-pinkas-rfc2560bis-00.

25 changes are indicated at the beginning of the document.
I will only mention a few of them:

A - Explanations were missing to describe:

     - the building of a request by an OCSP client,
     - the processing of a request by an OCSP server, 
     - the building of a response  by an OCSP server, and 
     - the processing of a response by an OCSP client.

These explanations have been added.

B - Explanations were missing to  address CA key rollover and OCSP key 
rollover.
     These explanations have been added.

C - Backwards compatibility has been addressed in the following way:

      1) An OCSP response by be signed either by a CA or by an OCSP 
Responder.

      2) Besides local configuration settings which are optional, only two 
cases 
        SHALL be supported by OCSP clients (and thus OCSP servers) as 
explained below.

       The key to be used to verify a SingleResponse (within a 
BasicOCSPResponse) MUST:

          (1) either be the same key that the one used to sign the target 
certificate,

          (2) or be the public key from an OCSP responder that is 
contained in an OCSP certificate 
               that has been signed by the same key that the one used to 
sign the target certificate.
    . 
The text allows to use the same general processing for a few other cases, 
since "escape" 
sentences are provided to allow for these other cases, but only using 
"local configuration settings".

This means in particular that the Identrust model may be supported and 
that the "several many cases" 
that were detailed in the annexes from draft -04 from David Cooper and 
Stefan Santesson 
(but which were not interoperable with most current implementations) can 
take benefit of the description 
of the general processing.

<br><font size=2 face="Arial">A few explanations about the content of draft-ietf-pinkas-rfc2560bis-00.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">25 changes are indicated at the beginning
of the document.</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I will only mention a few of them:</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">A - Explanations were missing to describe:</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the building of
a request by an OCSP client,</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the processing
of a request by an OCSP server, </font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the building of
a response &nbsp;by an OCSP server, and </font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the processing
of a response by an OCSP client.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">These explanations have been added.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">B - Explanations were missing to &nbsp;address
CA key rollover and OCSP key rollover.</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These explanations
have been added.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">C - Backwards compatibility has been
addressed in the following way:</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) An OCSP response
by be signed either by a CA or by an OCSP Responder.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) </font><font size=2 face="Arial">Besides
local configuration settings which are optional, </font><font size=2 face="sans-serif">o</font><font size=2 face="Arial">nly
two cases <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SHALL be supported by OCSP clients (and thus
OCSP servers) as explained below.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The key to be
used to verify a SingleResponse (within a BasicOCSPResponse) MUST:</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) either
be the same key that the one used to sign the target certificate,<br>
</font>
<br><font size=2 face="Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) or
be the public key from an OCSP responder that is contained in an OCSP certificate
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that has been signed
by the same key that the one used to sign the target certificate.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;. </font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">The text allows to use the same general
processing for a few other cases, since &quot;escape&quot; <br>
sentences are provided to allow for these other cases, but only using &quot;local
configuration settings&quot;.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">This means in particular that the Identrust
model may be supported and that the &quot;several many cases&quot; <br>
that were detailed in the annexes from draft -04 from David Cooper and
Stefan Santesson <br>
(but which were not interoperable with most current implementations) can
take benefit of the description <br>
of the general processing.</font>

        Piyush:

        I can't speak for Denis, but here's what I see.  First, the=20
Extension type is typically used in a SEQUENCE OF or SET OF.  Second, the=20
critical flag in the Extension always affects the parent of that SEQUENCE=20
OF or SET OF, but may not radiate beyond that.  It often goes higher than=20
that, but whether it goes to the top of the ASN.1 structure in use depends =

on the particular structure.  For example, invalidating TBSCertificate=20
always invalidates Certificate.  At the opposite extreme, a recipient who=20
doesn't recognize a critical extension within one of the certificates in=20
CMS originatorInfo (see RFC 3852 section 6.1) may still build a chain that =

doesn't include that certificate.
        RFC 5280 section 5.3 says that if "a CRL contains a critical CRL=20
entry extension that the application cannot process, then the application=20
MUST NOT use that CRL to determine the status of any certificates".  This=20
obviously means that an unrecognized critical entry extension invalidates=20
tbsCertList and CertificateList, not just the individual entry in=20
revokedCertificates.
        Denis' proposal, although I don't believe that it's required as an =

interpretation of the existing standards, boils down to having an=20
unrecognized singleExtension invalidate SingleResponse but not=20
ResponseData.  The CRL Entry precedent goes against it, since a natural=20
rule similar to that precedent would be that "for signed structures=20
containing extensions, an unrecognized critical extension renders the=20
innermost signature covering the extension invalid".  However, that rule=20
is just a generalization of a few cases which we have, rather than a rule=20
that has been explicitly adopted by anyone.  I think Denis' proposal is=20
better for singleExtension anyway.

Denis,
=20
I think your proposal is based on the assumption that existing text in=20
section 4.1.2.9 applies to ?type? Extensions as opposed to ?instance? of=20
Extensions within structure TBSCertificates.
=20
This assumption may not be correct because in later sections 5280 re-=20
defines what Extensions mean in context of a CRL and in context of CRL=20
entry.=20
Your proposal would certainly require changes in 5.1.2.7 and 5.2.
=20
Also, your proposed text for Extension imposes restrictions on how other=20
specifications can use this structure.  Please see inline for additional=20

Subject: [pkix] Clarifications in section 4.2 from RFC 5280
=20
The discussion about the crlEntryExtensions lead me to read again sections =

4.1.2.9=20
and 4.2 from RFC 5280.=20

Section 4.2 has originally been written only in the context of certificate =

extensions, whereas=20
extensions are now used by many other RFCs (in particular RFC 2560, which=20
import the Extensions=20
syntax and hence its description).=20

[piyush] The description in 4.2 applies specifically to extensions in=20
context of tbsCertificates.

The current text needs to be "clarified".=20

I have  reshuffled the text to separate the definition of "extensions",=20
used by RFCs=20
(including RFC 5280 and RFC 2560) from the definition of  "certificate=20
extensions".=20

Basically, the text which was specific to "certificate extensions" has=20
been moved into section 4.2.1.=20

Section 4.2 which is called "Certificates Extensions" has been renamed=20
"Extensions".=20
It is specific to extensions which are used by any  RFC which wants to use =

the syntax and its meaning.=20
All the relationships with "certificate extensions" have been removed in=20
the new section 4.2.=20
[piyush] exisiting 4.2 applies  to certificate extension. It does not=20
apply to any other extensions (CRL, Crl Entry or extensions used in 2560,=20
5055 or any other ARFC). Even within 5280 there are separate sections to=20
define what ?Extensions? means in context of CRLs and CRL entries.


You will find here after the (1) new proposed text, (2) the current text,=20
and (3) an extract from X.509.=20

NEW PROPOSED TEXT:=20

4.1.2.9.  Extensions

   This field MUST only appear if the version is 3 (Section 4.1.2.1).=20
   If present, this field is a SEQUENCE of one or more extensions.  =20
   The format and content of the extensions field are defined in=20
   section 4.2.=20

4.2.  Extensions=20

   The extensions field allows addition of new fields to a structure=20
   without modification to the ASN.1 definition.  An extension field=20
   consists of an extension identifier, a criticality flag, and an=20
   encoding of a data value of an ASN.1 type associated with the=20
   identified extension.=20

   Each extension includes an OID and an ASN.1 structure.  When an=20
   extension appears in a structure , the OID appears as the field=20
   extnID and the corresponding ASN.1 DER encoded structure is the=20
   value of the octet string extnValue.  A SEQUENCE MUST NOT include=20
   more than one instance of a particular extension.=20

[piyush] There could be scenarios outside 5280 where more than one=20
instance of same extensions in a sequence are useful.

   For those extensions where ordering of individual extensions within=20
   the SEQUENCE is significant, the specification of those individual=20
   extensions shall include the rules for the significance of the order=20
   therein.=20

   An extension includes the boolean critical, with a default value of=20
   FALSE.  The text for each extension specifies the acceptable values=20
   for the critical field for implementations conforming to this=20
   profile.=20

   A processing system MUST reject the content of the SEQUENCE where=20
   the extension appears if it encounters a critical extension it does=20
   not recognize or a critical extension that contains information that=20
   it cannot process.=20
[piyush] which SEQUENCE ? immediate parent or the top level SEQUENCE? I=20
think it depends on the extension that is being defined.=20


   A non-critical extension MUST be processed if it is recognized and=20
   MAY be ignored if it is not recognized.=20

[piyush] It is relevant in context of 5280 but other specifications should =

be free to define their own processing rules.

   Note that any extension that is flagged non-critical will cause=20
   inconsistent behaviour between processing systems that will process=20
   the extension and processing systems that do not recognize the=20
   extension and will ignore it.=20

   =20
4.2.1.  Standard Extensions=20

   The following sections present recommended extensions used within=20
   Internet certificates and standard locations for information.  =20

   Communities may elect to use additional extensions; however,=20
   caution ought to be exercised in adopting any critical extensions=20
   in certificates that might prevent use in a general context.=20

   The extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates provide methods for=20
   associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for=20
   managing relationships between CAs.  The X.509 v3 certificate format=20
   also allows communities to define private extensions to carry=20
   information unique to those communities.  =20

   Conforming CAs MUST support key identifiers (Sections 4.2.1.1 and=20
   4.2.1.2), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), key usage (Section=20
   4.2.1.3), and certificate policies (Section 4.2.1.4) extensions.  If=20
   the CA issues certificates with an empty sequence for the subject=20
   field, the CA MUST support the subject alternative name extension=20
   (Section 4.2.1.6).  Support for the remaining extensions is OPTIONAL.=20
   Conforming CAs MAY support extensions that are not identified within=20
   this specification; certificate issuers are cautioned that marking=20
   such extensions as critical may inhibit interoperability.=20

   At a minimum, applications conforming to this profile MUST recognize=20
   the following extensions: key usage (Section 4.2.1.3), certificate=20
   policies (Section 4.2.1.4), subject alternative name (Section=20

Piyush,
=20
I read your arguments. However, when an ASN.1 parameter is defined in an RFC
and when it is imported by another RFC, both the ASN.1 syntax *and its sema=
ntics*=20
are imported.
=20
RC 5280 omitted to define the semantics of Extensions independently of the =
context of=20
certificates and CRLs, hence why such a definition is needed, since Extensi=
ons is=20
imported and used in other RFCs, including OCSP.
=20
So you are correct: changes are also required in sections 5.1.2.7 and 5.2, =
so that=20
they can refer to the new proposed section &#8220;4.2. Extensions&#8221;.
=20
I believe that the following argument you raised is valid:
=20
   A SEQUENCE MUST NOT include more than one instance of a=20
   particular extension.=20
There could be scenarios outside 5280 where more than one instance of same =

extensions in a sequence are useful.
=20
So this sentence should be removed from the proposed new section 4.2 and mo=
ved=20
to section 4.2.1.
=20
Section 4.2 has been redrafted to include the case indicated by Sharon whic=
h is:
=20
Therefore, a critical extension in the crlEntryExtensions field of an entry=
 shall affect=20
only the certificate specified in that entry, unless there is a related cri=
tical extension=20
in the crlExtensions field that advertises a special treatment for it.&#822=
1;

However, this text has been generalized since it is applicable in general a=
nd not only to crlEntryExtensions.
=20
Here is a new proposed text for sections 4.2 and 4.2.1:
=20
   The extensions field allows addition of new fields to a structure=20
   without modification to the ASN.1 definition.  An extension field=20
   consists of an extension identifier, a criticality flag, and an=20
   encoding of a data value of an ASN.1 type associated with the=20
   identified extension.=20

   Each extension includes an OID and an ASN.1 structure.  When an=20
   extension appears in a structure, the OID appears as the field e
   extnID and the corresponding ASN.1 DER encoded structure is the=20
   value of the octet string extnValue. =20
=20
   For those extensions where ordering of individual extensions within=20
   the SEQUENCE is significant, the specification of those individual=20
   extensions shall include the rules for the significance of the order=20
   therein.=20

   An extension includes the boolean critical, with a default value of=20
   FALSE.  The text for each extension specifies the acceptable values=20
   for the critical field for implementations conforming to this=20
   profile.=20

   An extension marked critical in a field from a SEQUENCE or=20
   from a SET OF shall only affect that SEQUENCE or that SET OF,=20
   unless there is another critical extension in an upper SEQUENCE or=20
   an upper SET OF which advertises a special treatment for it.  In=20
   such a case, the relying party must be able to process both critical=20
  extensions.
=20
   A processing system MUST reject the content of the SEQUENCE or =20
   of the SET OF where the extension appears if it encounters a critical=20
   extension it does not recognize or a critical extension that contains=20
   information that it cannot process.=20
=20
   A non-critical extension MUST be processed if it is recognized and=20
  MAY be ignored if it is not recognized.=20
   Note that any extension that is flagged non-critical will cause=20
   inconsistent behaviour between processing systems that will process=20
   the extension and processing systems that do not recognize the=20
   extension and will ignore it.=20
=20
4.2.1.  Standard Extensions=20

 The following sections present recommended extensions used within=20
  Internet certificates and standard locations for information.  =20

 Communities may elect to use additional extensions; however,=20
  caution ought to be exercised in adopting any critical extensions=20
  in certificates that might prevent use in a general context.=20

 The extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates provide methods for=20
 associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for=20
 managing relationships between CAs.  The X.509 v3 certificate format=20
 also allows communities to define private extensions to carry=20
  information unique to those communities.
=20
   A certificate NOT include more than one instance of a particular=20
   extension.   =20

  Conforming CAs MUST support key identifiers (Sections 4.2.1.1 and=20
  4.2.1.2), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), key usage (Section=20
  4.2.1.3), and certificate policies (Section 4.2.1.4) extensions.  If=20
  the CA issues certificates with an empty sequence for the subject  =20
    field, the CA MUST support the subject alternative name extension=20
  (Section 4.2.1.6).  Support for the remaining extensions is OPTIONAL.=20
  Conforming CAs MAY support extensions that are not identified within=20
  this specification; certificate issuers are cautioned that marking=20
  such extensions as critical may inhibit interoperability.=20

   At a minimum, applications conforming to this profile MUST recognize=20
   the following extensions: key usage (Section 4.2.1.3), certificate=20
   policies (Section 4.2.1.4), subject alternative name (Section=20
   4.2.1.6), basic constraints (Section 4.2.1.9), name constraints=20
   (Section 4.2.1.10), policy constraints (Section 4.2.1.11), extended=20
   key usage (Section 4.2.1.12), and inhibit anyPolicy (Section=20
   4.2.1.14).


Here is a new proposed text for sections 5.1.2.7 and 5.2:
=20

5.1.2.7.  Extensions=20
   This field may only appear if the version is 2 (Section 5.1.2.1).  If
   present, this field is a sequence of one or more CRL extensions.  CRL
   extensions are discussed in Section 5.2.
5.2.  CRL Extensions
   The extensions field defined in section 4.2 provide a method for associa=
ting
   additional attributes with CRLs.  The v2 CRL format also allows
   communities to define private extensions to carry information unique
   to those communities.  Each extension in a CRL may be designated as=20
   critical or non-critical. If a CRL contains a critical CRL extension=20
   that the application cannot process, then the application MUST NOT=20
   use that CRL to determine the status of any certificate identified=20
   in that entry.  However, applications may ignore unrecognized non-
   critical CRL extensions.
Here is a new proposed text for sections 5.3:
5.3.  CRL Entry Extensions
   The extensions field defined in section 4.2 provide a method for associa=
ting
   additional attributes with CRL entries.  The v2 CRL format also=20
   allows communities to define private CRL entry extensions to carry
   information unique to those communities.  Each extension in a CRL
   entry may be designated as critical or non-critical.  If a CRL
   contains a critical CRL entry extension that the application cannot
   process, then the application MUST NOT use that CRL entry to=20
   determine the status of the certificate identified in that entry.
  =20
   The following subsections present recommended extensions used within
   Internet CRL entries and standard locations for information.
   Communities may elect to use additional CRL entry extensions;
   however, caution should be exercised in adopting any critical CRL
   entry extensions in CRLs that might be used in a general context.
   Support for the CRL entry extensions defined in this specification is
   optional for conforming CRL issuers and applications.  However, CRL
   issuers SHOULD include reason codes (Section 5.3.1) and invalidity
   dates (Section 5.3.2) whenever this information is available.

Russ, I realize the RFC 5280 references the 2005 edition of X.509. However =
the 2009 edition (freely available athttp://www.x500standard.com/index.php?=
n=3DIg.LatestAvail ) revises this text again slightly and I think makes the=
 intent even clearer. It states (as part of the main text and no longer a n=

If an extension affects the treatment of the list (e.g., multiple CRLs need=
 to be scanned to examine the entire list of revoked certificates, or an en=
try may represent a range of certificates), then either that extension or a=
 related extension shall be indicated as critical in the crlExtensionsfield=
. Therefore, a critical extension in the crlEntryExtensions field of an ent=
ry shall affect only the certificate specified in that entry, unless there =
is a related critical extension in the crlExtensions field that advertises =

his Specification is the certificateIssuer CRL entry extension and the rela=
ted issuingDistributionPoint CRL extension when theindirectCRL Boolean from=
 that extension is set to TRUE.=20
 =20
 =20
This is clearly the case for certificateIssuer as you indicate below and as=
 you note below the only other 2 standard crl entry extensions are irreleva=

rlEntry extension would also have to follow that same rule to be compliant =
with the base standard. I do believe the 2005 text was clear but offer this=

RFC 5280 describes three CRL Entry Extensions, and all of them come from X.=
509:=20
 =20
            5.3.1.  Reason Code=20
            5.3.2.  Invalidity Date=20
            5.3.3.  Certificate Issuer=20
 =20
The first two do not have the concern that you describe, and the third one =
should only be present if the CRL includes the IssuingDistributionPoint CRL=
 extension, and that extension includes the indirectCRL set to TRUE.  The I=
ssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension must be critical.  RFC 5280 says:=20
 =20
   The issuing distribution point is a critical CRL extension that=20
   identifies the CRL distribution point and scope for a particular CRL,=20
   and it indicates whether the CRL covers revocation for end entity=20
   certificates only, CA certificates only, attribute certificates only,=20
   or a limited set of reason codes.  Although the extension is=20
   critical, conforming implementations are not required to support this=20
   extension.  However, implementations that do not support this=20
   extension MUST either treat the status of any certificate not listed=20
   on this CRL as unknown or locate another CRL that does not contain=20
   any unrecognized critical extensions.=20

the CRL includes the IssuingDistributionPoint CRL extension, and that ext=

 that <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;identifies the CRL distribution point and scope fo=

Filename: draft-pinkas-2560bis-certinfo
Revision: 00
Title: CertInfo single response extension Update to OCSP < draft-pinkas-256=
0bis-certinfo-00.txt >
Creation date: 2012-08-31
WG ID: Individual Submission
Number of pages: 7
URL:             http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pinkas-2560bis-c=
ertinfo-00.txt
Status:          http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pinkas-2560bis-certi=
nfo
Htmlized:        http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pinkas-2560bis-certinfo-00

Abstract:
   OCSP [RFC2560] has been designed to allow an OCSP server to use
   any kind of trustable information to answer to a client varying
   from CRLs to an access to a database of issued certificates.

   In its original version, OCSP does not allow taking full advantage
   of an access to a database of issued certificates.

   When a database of issued certificates is used by an OCSP server,
   this document explains how the OCSP server shall respond and how
   OCSP clients shall react.

   The proposal is intended to update 2560bis. It defines a new single
   extension in a single response, called certInfo.  The extension is
   non critical.  The meaning of "good", "revoked" and "unknown" are
   unchanged.                                                              =
                 =20

Really? OCSP allows to access a database of issued certificates, but
does not allow it? At the same time?
