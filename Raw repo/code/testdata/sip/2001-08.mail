Hi,

Can't we use the "inactive" tag, so we don't have to define a new?
"Inactive" is used by both MGCP and MEGACO when a connection is created,
but no media is supposed to be sent nor received, so maybe it would be a
good idea to use the same tag also for SIP.

For RTP, the trick is going to be to figure out which of the two succeeded
when you start receiving packets. For regular unidirectional RTP, its not
clear that the source address tells you much. For symmetric RTP, its easy if
you are the active side (the source address in the media in the reverse
direction matches one of the two places you sent media to).

That doesn't sound right... for all the nat cases it should be the address
you sent to (at least for symmetric RTP).

Just to be clear, you do not need a new attribute for hold. In the current
usage of 0.0.0.0, hold is unidirectional. As a result, using a=sendonly is
the appropriate way to replace this functionality.

There is also a need, I think, to indicate that a media stream is
temporarily disabled (in which case there is neither RTP or RTCP in either
direction). But, this is not needed for hold.

"may" is not strong enough. I think the consensus was to continue to have
call-ids be unique, in which case the replacement call MUST use a new
call-id.

To quote the great Homer Simpson:

"Doh!"

This problem is why bis-04 requests the creation of an IANA registry for
response codes. However, I don't know if it can be established prior to
publication of bis as an rfc, which is what we really want. I did ask IANA
about that, but got no reply.

Anyway, since Adam was there first, I will change this in the early media
draft to something else.

Thanks,

Actually, the hearing-impaired draft has some flows that involve end-user

See section 6.2.

You are correct that the first paragraph is not technically correct.
Although it is just meant to give an overall idea of operation, it should be
right. I will fix it.

The bit about dns-uncapable UAs would apply. Basically, the rule is that if
you don't send the request to the top element in the route set, don't pop
it. dns-less UA is one case where this will happen, but not the only one.
I'll clarify that.

It ties back into another discussion we've been having. In general, if A
sends a re-INVITE to B and gets a 481, should it just consider the call
down, or send a BYE? The consensus on the list was to send a BYE. There were
several reasons for that:

1. we have a general rule that a non-2xx response to a re-invite does not
mean the call is down, just that the re-invite failed. We don't want to
special case 481.

2. There may be call stateful proxies that would like to see the BYE. 

3. We should only have one way of ending a call once established - sending a
BYE.

Dear All,

I would like to have a meeting at the IETF (informal BOF?) discussing
methods for VoIP and Multimedia over IP traversing non-upgraded firewalls
and NATs.  These methods are intended to supplement the firewall
architecture, and not require upgrade to existing firewall/NAT components,
or clients (and other infrastructure such as proxies).

There is a draft discussing one proposal at:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-davies-fw-nat-traversal-00.txt

If others have ideas in this area, then please contact me and we can arrange
some sort of agenda.  (Although note that I will be out of contact until the
Sunday before the IETF - i.e. this Sunday! - so we might have to organise
this at the IETF.)

I hope the format will be something like:

- Overview presentation of method
- How this is secure and maintains administrator control
- (Repeat for each proposal)
- Collect issues that need to be addressed before going to a formal BOF.

(The modified agenda involves the final item being changed to 'chaos'!)

At this stage I would like to avoid discussion about how this compares to
MidCom and other approaches - such as Rosenberg's - as I think it will
quickly turn into a blood bath.  - We should save that for the formal BOF!

I'm hoping to hold the meeting in:

    The King's Suite/Sandringham 1 on
    Thursday 17:45 -> 18:45,

but I obviously haven't had a chance to check this with the organisers.
Therefore, please look out for final details on the noticeboard, and
probably the door of the King's Suite.

I look forward to seeing you all,

Pete.

(P.S.  Sorry for putting this on the SG16 and TIPHON lists, but I'm well
aware that many of you attend the IETF and I wanted to make sure you had the
opportunity to come along.)

  When we were first discussing methods of performing attended call
transfer, there was alot of discussion about using the Call-ID to
perform the replaces operation, that is, the replacement call (or
joining call) would be identified by having the same Call-ID as an
existing call.

  So, the text should really read "in our replaces model, a unique
call-id may be given to the replacement call, instead of previous models
which overloaded the meaning of the call-id".  I wasn't trying to
dictate behavior either way.

> I suggest that "A unique call-id MUST be given to the replacement
> call".

  Since this seems to be the modern consensus on the issue, I will
clarify this in the draft.

Hi,

You can use a MIME message body. Then you can include SDP, text and
whatever else you want - all in the same message. The UAC must support
MIME, of course.

Hi,

You can use a MIME message body. Then you can include SDP, text and
whatever else you want - all in the same message. The UAC must support
MIME, of course.

Yes.

In draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-10.txt you can read how it's done in SIP for
ISUP message bodies. Of course you can also read the MIME RFCs.

Yes, sendonly  works if A puts B on hold in a sendrecv stream. However,
if you have a recvonly stream and you want to put it on hold, you need
the neither-send-nor-receive tag.

OK, we can call the "on hold" scenario I just described as a
"temporarily disabled media" (the latter is probably more accurate).
Anyway, we still need the new tag. I do not really care if we call it
neithersendnorrecv, nomedia or inactive. However, as Christer suggested,
in order to be consistent with other protocols we can use "inactive".

Anyway, my question is: Colin, do you think that such a tag should be
included in SDPnew? Otherwise we can write a half-page draft defining
this attribute.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello,

Yes, having an IANA registry for response codec would help have
consistent specs. We will most likely use the "request updated" response
code in the next version of the overlap draft, so we better be
consistent :o)

Have a look at the 3pcc draft. It contains the motivation for all the
decisions that we have made. I believe that your concern was also
included there.

This problem is addressed by the latest version of the draft (02)

You can INVITE without SDP and then reject all the media streams offered
in the 200 OK (by setting ports to zero in the ACK).

However, if a UA receives an ACK that rejects allt he media streams, it
might get confused. On the other hand, an ACK that puts streams on hold
does not seem as surprising for the UA.

Yes.  "inactive" is already commonly used in MGCP
call waiting scenarios.

I believe it does. The syntax would look like this:

a=group:FID 1 2
m=audio 10000 RTP/AVT 8
c=IN IP4 123.123.123.123
a=mid:1
m=audio 20000 RTP/AVT 8
c=IN IP4 10.0.0.1
a=mid:2

The application would send media to both addresses at the same time (in
parallel), since both contain codec 8.

Gonzalo

Hello,

I'm currently working on DHCPv6 and I'm interested in one option
proposed by Schulzrinne and Nair for DHCP (draft-ietf-sip-dhcp-04.txt).
It is the DHCP Option for SIP Servers and it looks like this:

 Code  Len      DNS name of SIP server
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
| TBD |  n  | s1  | s2  | s3  | s4  | s5  |  ...
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

As far as I see, is this option only for IPv4 (due to that code and len
are only 8 bit long and in DHCPv6 these both are 16 bit). Is there any
plan to make an option for DHCPv6?

With best regards
Martin Stiemerling

If you can squeeze your short text message into the reason phrase in the
status line of the response you'll have a much better chance of
interoperating than if you use multiparts.

No plan, but would be a good idea. Are you volunteering?

> That doesn't sound right... for all the nat cases it should be the address
> you sent to (at least for symmetric RTP). 

I'll be concrete here with an example, although I realize the details
don't match your I-D that closely. Think of two clients, A and B, 
both of which are sending and receiving RTP on a single UDP port (lets
not consider RTCP for now), and who are also communicating with a 
SIP server using that same UDP port. The SIP server is acting as a
B2BUA conference server, shuffling SDP's between clients A and B to
set up the session. No SIP proxies or ALGs in this scenareo.

Each client sends in its SDP to the SIP server the IP/port it thinks it
has. The SIP server can tell if the client is behind a NAT, and if so
adds extra connection and media lines to the SDP whose port and IP number
correspond to those it would add in the received and rport parameters of
a Via. The SIP server sends this (potentially) modified SDP to the other
client, who then uses it to start the RTP session, by sending RTP to
both IP/ports sets in the SDP. This is happening for both clients, so
initially 

-- client A is sending the first RTP wave to one or maybe 2 IP/ports for B
-- client B is sending the first RTP wave to one or maybe 2 IP/ports for A

In a world with static IP's and Full Cone NATs, I believe this first
wave always has a happy ending -- whether both clients are behind a
different NAT, both are behind the same NAT, or one or both have
static IPs, each client will receive one of the two RTP packets sent
by the other, and examining the IP/port reveals one of the  
two sources it also sent to. There's now enough knowledge to discard
the useless address and just send on one channel.

But consider the case where the clients are behind different NATs, 
but B's NAT isn't Full Cone -- it only lets in a UDP packet whose IP/port  
matches the IP/port destination address of the outgoing packet that
established the binding. 

At the start of the session client A sends out
his first wave of two RTP packets, but neither get to client B -- 
B's NAT discarded the packet that should have gotten through. Meanwhile,
B's RTP wave is successful in getting to A, since A has a more sensible
NAT. Client A is able to use the IP/port of the received packet to start
sending data successfully back to B -- but:

      this IP/port will be different than both IP/ports it used
      to send to B the first time, I believe.

And, to finish the story, the hopeless case seems to be when both 
client A and B are behind different NATs that aren't full cone, unless
one of the clients is using a service provider that doesn't do egress
filter, in which case source forging might work ... or else, of course,
use a third party to shuttle every RTP packet.

Is this scenareo too different from your I-D for the conclusions to
apply, or is there an error in the logic above?

Hi Aniruddha,

We can implement "learning" EPIC in 3 ways:

Offline version: Train the scheme offline for, say, SIP compression and
put the resulting profile into an Internet Draft.

Profiling version: Whilst performing SIP compression, dynamically update
the profile at the compressor only. Periodically download the updated
profile to the decompressor, and switch to the new profile when the download
is complete.

Dynamic version: Update the profile simultaneously at the compressor and
decompressor. Note that as both the compressor and decompressor must
see exactly the same packets, this only works over a reliable link.

My own preference for SIP compression is just to use the offline version.
If the profile becomes out-of-date then we suffer a slight drop in compression
efficiency, but this is outweighed by the very low working memory requirements
(as the SIP profile can be fixed in ROM).

Hi Price

    I read about "learning" EPIC but I don't understand how a decompressor will know what a "learning" compressor has "learned" so far? 
    I understand that both compressor and decompressor negotiate the profile and by that they know how other side will behave. But the compressor is "learning".. if I have understood it correct then "learning" would mean that the compressor will learn about new fields in the packets and add them to existing profile and other part is choosing compression scheme depending on probability of occurance of the field.. how does decompressor synchronize with that? How will this be handled in packet loss conditions?

To me this breaks the notion that pre-loaded routes 
are equivalent to strict source routing in IP. There 
are other things I don't like about the comparison, like 
the fact Route entries are urls, so could we lose the 
text making this comparison in 16.6?

I am also interested in discussing more about what the
other cases may be. I feel that a proxy might want 
to do this too.

Cheers,
Neil.

> How compression negotiation is done for SIP? 

It can be done either at SIP layer (by adding new 
headers/parameters) or at the compression layer
(transparent to SIP). The latter is more generic 
as the same compression can be applied to application 
layer protocols other than SIP.

> How does Proxy server know when to use compression 
> (as compression should be used only if there is cellular
> link between proxy and end node)? 

The compression entity at a mobile UA and the compression
entity at the proxy server need to initialize/negotiate
(see above) the compression context before compression 
happens. This can be done, for example, when a mobile
powers on or roaming to a new proxy server. After that,
the proxy server will compress messages sent from/to
the mobile.

> when proxy server wants to connect to other end user, it 
> is starting session, does it know about link characteristics 
> between itself and the other end?

No, it doesn't need to. The assumption is that each mobile 
pairs with a first-hop SIP proxy server (see above).

Zhigang

Hi,

These requirements seem fine to me - assuming of course that SIP
compression is performed on a per-hop basis.

What about compression between a mobile and a SIP proxy? Is this beyond
the scope of the ROHC WG?

Regards,

Richard P

Hi,

From the discussions I see that compression of SIP is the major concern all
have, but maybe we should also look at the current version of the
requirements document as we will discuss requirements in London, not only
solutions.
Chapter 3 of,
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rohc-signaling-req-assump-01.
txt states the current requirements. There are most likely requirements
missing and maybe not all are wanted...

Hello Jonathan,

I have read the early media draft again. I will give my opinion on some
of the open questions that you have placed in the draft and I will make
a proposal.

The current mechanism effectively "trashes" the SDP contained in the
first INVITE (and the SDP contained in re-INVITEs). Even if we are using
a Require header and there would not be any backward compatibility
problems, I do not like that.

The current draft considers that when I add a media stream to the early
media it means that I would like to have the same media stream added to
the final media (media after the 200 OK). I would like to differentiate
between early media and final media. That is, I can send you an INVITE
with an audio media stream and a video media stream. You send me early
media that consists of audio only. However, when you finally answer with
a 200 OK, I want you to answer my original proposal (video+audio), not
to renegotiate the parameters that we were using for early media.

My proposal is that negotiation of final media and negotiation of early
media are kept separate. That is, the SDP in the 200 OK will always be
the answer to the SDP in the INVITE. Regardless of whether we are using
early media or not (I believe that this is more consistent with bis).

This would avoid media clipping when the 200 OK finally arrives, since
the UAS can send media without waiting for the ACK.

The process of changing early media parameters would have to be changed.
Right now the UAC issues a re-INVITE. The SDP in this re-INVITE is
effectively ignored (the real SDP exchange is 1xx-PRACK). My proposal is
that the SDP in the re-INVITE is an update (or a refresh) of the SDP
that was contained in the first INVITE. 

In short, I want the "INVITE-200 OK" SDP exchange to be independent of
the "1xx-PRACK" SDP exchange.

I believe that keeping both negotiations separate (early media
parameters and final media parameters) is a powerful tool. I can update
my final media SDP without updating my early media SDP and vice versa
(or update both at the same time, of course).

Opinions?

Best regards,

Gonzalo

  Abstract 
      
     This document defines an efficient, robust, and scalable scheme for the
compression of text-based protocols. Such protocols (e.g. SIP, SDP) when
sent uncompressed over limited bandwidth networks (such as Cellular or the
upstream of Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)) causes inadvertent delays in call set
up. TCCB addresses these problems and proposes a simple mechanism to reduce
the size of the messages and hence the recurrent delay.

it seems to me that most of the section 16.4.1 about local outbound
proxies is bogus.  if local outbound proxy has been configured for a ua,
then the ua should send ALL requests with or without route headers or
with or without dns capability via that proxy.  a very common reason why
local outbound proxy has been configured for a ua is that the site has a
firewall that denies 5060 traffic directly to/from the ua.  

if the text doesn't clearly mandate the use of configure outbound proxy,
then some ua's would work and some others would not or we would include
yet another parameter to the ua configuration, which is a very bad idea.

also, the text doesn't tell what the ua should place in the request-uri
when the ua didn't send the initial request.

Hello,

> Is it allowed for a UAS to change the original value of the SDP "t=" field in its 200 response?


The t value is typically intended to be used for pre-arranged events.
That is, the evening news will be multicast from 9 pm thru 10 pm.

The SDP of an INVITE for an "ad-hoc" session typically contains t=0 0,
since there is no pre-established duraction for the session. When the
session is over, a BYE will be sent.

So, if you receive an INVITE for a pre-arrange session (for example, the
evening news from 9 thru 10), it means that the multicast (in this
example) will begin at 9 and finish at 10. If you answer with a
different t= value it just means that you will leave the multicast
session before or after it has finished, but it does not make any
difference.

So, to answer you question, t= is nothing that you negotiate. You can
send a BYE whenever you want, regardless of the t= value.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Let me be more specific. Say a UAC send t= 0 0 (for an ad hock session) but
the UAS likes to accept the call in 20 seconds, i.e. sends an immediate OK,
but wish to have the RTP ports open up only 20 seconds later on.

Would this be legal? (or is it non negotiable as you say...)

Hello,

That would be legal, because the session you are actually accepting in
the one that you are sending in the 200 OK. However, no UA supports
this.

So, when I said that this was not negotiable, I meant that nobody
implements this for ad-hoc sessions. It seems more reasonable to use a
retry-after header.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hi

How compression negotiation is done for SIP? How does Proxy server know when
to use compression (as compression should be used only if there is cellular
link between proxy and end node)? When SIP user starts session, it is
obvious, when proxy server wants to connect to other end user, it is
starting session, does it know about link characteristics between itself and
the other end?

Section 4 of the Session-Timer draft makes reference to a Response code of
422. I cannot find in any of the documents listed in the bibliography of
that response code. Is this a mis-print or am I missing a document?

In the Protocol Overview in draft 05 of Session Timer, it states in one
paragraph that:

"In all cases, the proxy MUST NOT insert or modify the value of the
"refresher" parameter in the Session-Expires header."

Then in a few paragraphs later, it states that a proxy can add a
Session-Expires header and set the "refresher" parameter to "uac".

I am assuming the MUST NOT only applies to Session-Expires that are inserted
by another entity, and a proxy can insert the refresher parameter if it
inserts the header. But the paragraph that includes the MUST NOT statement
also talks about a proxy inserting a Session Expires header.

Should this be clarified or do I need another cup of java?

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: ISUP to SIP Mapping
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Roach, J. Peterson, L. Ong
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-isup-02.txt
	Pages		: 54
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
This document describes a way to perform the mapping between two
signaling protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
ISDN User Part (ISUP) of SS7.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-02.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-isup-02.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-02.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can support multi-party
conferencing in many different ways. In this draft, we define the
various multi-party conferencing models, and for each, discuss how
they are used and then analyze their relative benefits and drawbacks.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Session Timer
	Author(s)	: S. Donovan, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt
	Pages		: 28
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). This extension allows for a periodic refresh of SIP
sessions through a re-INVITE. The refresh allows both user agents and
proxies to determine if the SIP session is still active. The
extension defines a new general header, Session-Expires, which
conveys the lifetime of the session.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: NAT Friendly SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, J. Weinberger, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt
	Pages		: 32
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
In this draft, we discuss how SIP can traverse enterprise and
residential firewalls and NATs. This environment is challenging
because we assume here that the end user has little or no control
over the firewall or NAT, and that the firewall or NAT is completely
ignorant of SIP

	Author(s)	: M. Handley, H. Schulzrinne, E. Schooler, J. Rosenberg

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The SIP Supported Header
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-serverfeatures-05.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a client to request that a particular protocol extension be
used to process the request. The server declines the request if it
does not support the extension. However, there is currently no way
for a server to determine which extensions are supported by the
client. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the server
to tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define
a way for a client to query a server about the extensions it
supports. This document defines a SIP extension that allows clients
to indicate, in a request, the set of extensions supported. We also
define a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request,
to determine the extensions supported by a server.

Is it not so that it could be the same compression scheme in both cases
(generic solution)? What would be different is how to  negotiate the usage
of the compression scheme in the first case.

Hello,

While REGISTERING with a freely available PROXY , we are getting 482 =
REQUEST MERGING response.
This should be the case when the VIA header in the request conatins =
PROXY's IP Address.=20
But in our case the VIA header conatins our host IP Address.

What may be the problem?

Thanks and Regards
Sunil Zack

Hi,
Comments inline.

>These requirements seem fine to me - assuming of course that SIP
>compression is performed on a per-hop basis.


The requirements are not only considering SIP compression. The intention is
to provide requirements for a generic solution applicable for compression of
ASCII based signaling protocols, such as SIP/SDP, RTSP etc..

>What about compression between a mobile and a SIP proxy?
I believe that the requirements apply also to this case.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Session Timer
	Author(s)	: S. Donovan, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt
	Pages		: 28
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). This extension allows for a periodic refresh of SIP
sessions through a re-INVITE. The refresh allows both user agents and
proxies to determine if the SIP session is still active. The
extension defines a new general header, Session-Expires, which
conveys the lifetime of the session.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
	Author(s)	: M. Handley, H. Schulzrinne, E. Schooler, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.txt,.ps
	Pages		: 195
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: NAT Friendly SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, J. Weinberger, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt
	Pages		: 32
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
In this draft, we discuss how SIP can traverse enterprise and
residential firewalls and NATs. This environment is challenging
because we assume here that the end user has little or no control
over the firewall or NAT, and that the firewall or NAT is completely
ignorant of SIP

This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The SIP Supported Header
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-serverfeatures-05.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a client to request that a particular protocol extension be
used to process the request. The server declines the request if it
does not support the extension. However, there is currently no way
for a server to determine which extensions are supported by the
client. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the server
to tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define
a way for a client to query a server about the extensions it
supports. This document defines a SIP extension that allows clients
to indicate, in a request, the set of extensions supported. We also
define a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request,
to determine the extensions supported by a server.

Hi,

I agree with Gonzalo. Since early-media is something some nodes don't
support, or care about, let's keep it separate from the "final-media".

For example, if we don't keep early-media and final-media separate we
MAY come with something like the following: In a forking scenario, the
UAC may have an early-media "discussion" with UAS_1, but it may receive
a 200 OK from another UAS, UAS_2, and for any reason the UAC chooses to
start the session with UAS_2. The UAS_2 doesn't know anything about our
messages with UAS_1, so it uses the SDP in the INVITE to generate the
SDP in the 200.

I would also - once again - like to raise the issue about canceling
specific legs. If we, in a forking scenario, receive 18x from multiple
UAS (all of them may, for example, offer early media), and we choose one
of the legs, shouldn't we be able to CANCEL/BYE the other legs right
away? If we have to wait for a final response  it means that we have to
send PRACKs to the other UASs as well. I KNOW this we have had (too)
many discussions about this, and I KNOW about the problems related to
it, but I really think it's an important part of the whole forking
discussion, ESPECIALLY when early-media is involved.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Hi,

Considering a generic solution is fine provided that it doesn't delay the
availability of a SIP/SDP compression scheme. This is mainly a protocol
rather than an algorithm issue (as most of the proposed algorithms are generic
text compressors). If the protocol can also be made generic without too much
additional effort then it is a step worth taking.

Higher-layer compression might need one additional requirement - tolerance to
reordering between the compressor and decompressor. We should word this similarly
to Requirement 6, i.e:


   "The compression scheme must be able to tolerate the maximum expected message
   reordering between the compressor and decompressor."

This makes sure that the requirement is automatically fulfilled when there is no
message reordering (if per-hop compression is chosen).

Best regards,

Richard P

The requirements are not only considering SIP compression. The intention is
to provide requirements for a generic solution applicable for compression of
ASCII based signaling protocols, such as SIP/SDP, RTSP etc..

>What about compression between a mobile and a SIP proxy?
I believe that the requirements apply also to this case.

You need to take this question to the administrator
of the proxy, it is impossible to really help you with
out access to the message logs.

Before you do that it would help to better understand
request merging. It is not about responding Proxy seeing
it's own address in the Via header, it is about the same
request appearing to come from two different places
(i.e. having different Via headers). See:

http://www.jdrosen.net/sip/multiple_requests.txt

If you wish to further discuss request merging,
or any other points relating to current protocol operation,
please post them to the SIP Implementors list not here.

Cheers,
Neil.

Hello,

While REGISTERING with a freely available PROXY , we are getting 482
REQUEST MERGING response.
This should be the case when the VIA header in the request conatins
PROXY's IP Address.
But in our case the VIA header conatins our host IP Address.

What may be the problem?

Thanks and Regards

Hi,

I would still ask for some further clarification.

I think this looks like a good solution for negotiating whether there is
compression at all or not, especially if SIP is considered. I don't know how
e.g. HTTP would work, would there be a new port for "compressed HTTP" as (at
least originally) defined for SSL/TLS?  

Two additional points:

1) Would it be so that SIP over "CUDP" would use a different destination
port than SIP over UDP? Or how else does the receiver know whether the
incoming packet contains a compressed or an uncompressed SIP message? 

2) I don't know if there is need for more complex negotiation. If so, I
assume this would somehow take place within the compression layer. As the
solution should be application-protocol neutral, it is probably not a good
idea to use e.g. SIP headers for this. I guess the required negotiation
could be piggy-packed within the initial protocol transaction, which in SIP
would be REGISTER-200.

In section 6 of bis-04, it says:

   A BYE request SHOULD NOT be sent to terminate a pending call
   request which has not generated either a final response or a
   provisional response containing a To tag.

Which implies that we are allowed to BYE a specific call-leg using the To
tag from a 1xx response. I think this is the right way to do it mainly
because we have complete UAC-to-UAS call-leg, it just has not been answered
yet. CANCELs should always match the original request and apply to the whole
request (although the cancel would not apply to answered (200-OK)
call-legs).

I think we need to add some text stating that the way to terminate a
"provisional call-leg" (one for which we have received a 1xx with a To-tag),
is to send BYE with the To-tag.

Also, do we need to have both a To-tag and a Contact from the 1xx, or would
we always get the To-tag with a Contact?

I do not like the idea of CANCEL for a specific call leg. I think we need to
be able to terminate a specific leg before it is answered (i.e., after 1xx),
and I think BYE does a far better job at this than CANCEL. One of the
reasons is that its e2e as opposed to purely between each hop, as CANCEL is.


So, my proposal is that a 1xx with tags and record-routes establish an
"early call leg". Within that early call leg, you can send non-INVITE
requests, including PRACK, INFO, BYE, etc. as you would for an answered call
leg. This covers all of the cases that Christer has raised. I'll be talking
about this one during IETF.

By "compression" I mean the entire compression functions 
including the negotiation etc. The difference is that 
in the latter case, the application protocol need not know 
anything about the compression (except perhaps its mere
existence if encryption is an issue). Therefore, we
can just insert the compression layer without any change
to the application protocol above.

I guess by "compression scheme" you mean the core compression
engine *excluding* the negotiation part. In that case, I
certainly agree with you. It can and should be common.

Jonathan,

This solution would then require the UAS to always insert the
Contact and Record-Route headers in 1xx responses.  I don't believe
that is currently required, except as needed for reliable provisional
responses (PRACK draft) and for resource preconditions (COMET draft).

Is there an issue with backward compatibility?

Would it still be required to include the Record-Route in the 200
response?  It would be nice to only require the UAC to perform the
Route header calculation once.

Is there plans to write a document that outlines how to deal with all
portability issues, both PSTN number portability and 8XX.  The complexities
of a 8XX call in the US networks is not caputured in the presented document.
An 8XX Call that is terminated to a PSTN Number that has been ported
provides three routing numbers LRN, Translated 800 Number in GAP C0, and 8XX
Number in GAP 00.  

What numbers would a SIP proxy need to complete this call?

What about billing or accounting how do these numbers map for that? 

Thx,
Nate Nelson

Well, it will work like most of our other approaches for backwards
compatibility. If the UAS doesn't send the 1xx with tags/RR, the client
can't send early requests. The main question is what is the strength for
sending the 1xx with tags/RR. Should we make it a SHOULD in bis?

Yes, I would think so. Otherwise, you lose compatibility with older clients
that won't look for it in the 1xx.

I think it works like other updates to RR. The only thing that can be
updated is the Contact.

Well, the question is how one "just inserts" the compression layer in such a
way that both sides know about it. Remember, signaling compression is
between a wireless phone and proxy, for example, which is end-to-end at the
IP layer (hop-by-hop in the SIP meaning), so the sender has to know whether
to insert this compression layer before it sends its first message to the
receiver. My proposal for modeling this as a SIP transport handles this
case. I suspect that the usage of SRV records, a key piece of the SIP
approach, will also work fine for other application protocols, such as RTSP.

That is one way, but again - the http client has to have some way of
handling the case when the server doesn't support compression, and is
therefore not listening on this port. This is why, in http, the negotiation
of the transport (tls/tcp) is handled within the http spec. In general, I
see no way around negotiating the use of the compression on an application
protocol by protocol basis.

SRV allows for the server to indicate what port it is expecting a particular
transport on. So, we could standardize a port, but SRV would eliminate the
need for it.

As I have said, I think it is unavoidable for each application protocol to
have to specify how to signal the usage of the compression in the first
place.

Yes, you are correct. The MUST NOT applies only when the session-expires
header was there in the first place. I'll clarify in -06. Thanks.

Oops. The formal definition of it needs to be defined with the session timer
spec itself. It is sent when a proxy or UAS feels that the session timer
value in a request was too small. The -05 spec does describe the overall
semantics for it, but its scattered in the various sections.

I'll include a separate discussion in -06.

SIP imposes restrictions about what can be in the 200 OK in order for both
sides to agree on whats going on. The text says nothing about the t value,
and I would argue that this parameter should not be negotiable.

I'm confused. My interpretation of the fid spec was that things in the same
group were alternates. So, it would not send to both at the same time. It
would instead choose one, which is not what you want.

I just thought of few scenarios, which having the ability to respond with a
200 OK and SDP:t=curr_time+x 0, may enable the UAS to let the UAC know it
accepted the call, but will be able to start interchanging RTP only x
seconds later on.

The same port for RTP and SIP? How will you demux?

We found that its easier for the client to figure out whether its behind a
nat, rather then the server to figure it out for it. This also simplifies
the overall operation, since proxies can just be proxies rather than having
to do all this SDP rewriting.

This works only with symmetric RTP, since otherwise you can't figure out
which one has succeeded or not.

This is symmetric RTP - send the media back to the source IP/port where it
came from. As you point out, it works only when ONE of the two parties is
behind symmetric nats.

Its pretty close. The main difference is that the clients to the detection
of whether they are behind a nat or not, and allocation of a public address
before the call is made. But otherwise, we use symmetric RTP if possible,
take advtantage of full-cone nats if possible, and only use a third party
intermediary server in the worst case when both are behind symmetric nats.

Since IANA seems to have delay and packet loss problems, maybe I can set
up a table of new codes. Anybody who has defined a new status code
outside of bis, please set me a reference.

Thanks.

Consider 505 a "hope we will never use placeholder". Feel free to send a 4xx
if you get a different version than 2.0.

Yes. But I don't see why this cannot be done at compression
layer (which is below the application protocol). The compression 
module at wireless phone can contact/negotiate with its peer
at the proxy to setup compression state. If this fails (e.g.
no response from peer or some other abnormal conditions), the 
local compression module simply passes any application message
transparently without applying compression (i.e. turn itself
off).

RTSP.

As I said, negotiation at application layer is certainly an 
alternative. But it looks to me less generic in that it may 
require additions/modifications to the existing application 
protocols. And we have to do that one by one. Second, there are
some details in the compression state (e.g. compression algorithm)
which I'm not sure should be handled at application layer.
Also, negotiation at compression layer allows the procedure to
be finished even before the first message is generated by the 
application protocol (e.g. as soon as the wireless phone is 
powered on). That mitigates the surge in bandwidth requirement 
and gives a smoother jump start for the compression (especially
of the first message).

Br,
Zhigang

Thanks for pointing it out. I've fixed it for -05.

Yes, you are correct. I have fixed this for -05 as well.

Pattern recognition on the beginning of the packet plus examination of
the source address, lets the client handle this problem, the SIP server
will only see SIP. For ISO 8859-1, the capital letter that starts a SIP
method will be in the range 65-90 decimal, whereas for version 2 and
above for RTP and RTCP, the first byte will be at least 128 (V=2). 
The next few bytes can be used as sanity checks.

Actually, we do also, but explaining it would have added several more 
paragraphs to an overly-long posting :-). Our SIP server always kicks
back the first INVITE with a 401 Unauthorized, the client checks out
the received and rport and adds the NAT information into the revised
SDP for the new INVITE, to which it also adds the appropriate 
SIP Authorization header field.

By the way, anyone reading on the list who wants to experiment with these
symmetric RTP ideas can download our network musical performance client
and bounce packets off our SIP server, I can send SIP logs of your 
session back to you in email if you want to see the NAT detection in action 
from the server side, see:

Good point. I added it for bis-05.

I was about to add Proxy-Authentication-Info too, and then I realized it
doesn't work. The reason is that multiple proxies might want to insert this
header. The header does not define a realm parameter, so that a UAC
receiving many Proxy-Authentication-Info headers in a 2xx won't know which
one applies to which realm. So, it won't be able to use the nextnonce, for
example, since it doesn't know whcih username/pass to apply to each nonce.

Our options are to:

1. forget about Proxy-Authentication-Info (its only briefly mentioned in
rfc2617, easy to miss....)
2. define our own extension to this header containing a realm parameter.

I have the feeling the Route header should be: Route:

Hi:

Section 3.1 of draft-rosenberg-sip-conferencing-models-01.txt mentions that for Large Scale Multicast conferences UAs do not need to send BYE when they leave the conference. 

I believe this mechanism wil work in most of the scenarios. However, what about when there is a proxy that Recorded Route, usuallly because it wants to be informed when the session is over. The rr proxy will never get a BYE, and it will have to rely on other mechanisms (let's say, session-timer) to remove the installed states.

I think the proposed behaviour of forgetting about BYEs will break in the common assumptions that BYEs are sent to indicate the end of the signalling relatioship.

/Miguel

I was hoping that someone will respond to this.
I know it is an implementation issue, but should'nt
the sip spec say 2 words about the process of 
computing the request hash - which parameters in
the url should be included .

Thanks,
Shail

When a transaction stateful proxy computes
the hash of the following fields :

Request-uri, From, To, Call-ID and Cseq.number
(maybe even topmost via)

does it include all url parameters of the sip urls
in the above fields ?

So, if the same request visits the proxy as

sip:abcd@proxy
sip:abcd@proxy;maddr=1.2.3.4

and the rest of the fields are same. Is this a loop ?
Don't ask me how this happened. Imagine that there is
one or more misbehaving client/proxy.

Thanks,

I don't see the need for a new draft, so if there's consensus on this, send
me some suggested wording.

Figure 2 in section 5.2 of the draft: I think the 200 PRACK (message 6) is
going in the wrong direction.  It should be from the UAS to the UAC, not the
other way around.

An application chooses one codec and then sends RTP over all the m lines
that contain that codec.

At the beginning I was assuming that a particular codec would be present
only in one m line. However, you suggested (in an MMUSIC meeting) that
we had to define semantics for this case (when a codec appears in
multiple m lines).

Henning and I finally agreed that this was the "right thing to do".
Version 03 of the draft already defines this behavior, but version 04
(will appear in the archives right after London) provides a more formal
definition (without changing the semantics).

Regards,

Gonzalo

Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org

Precedence: bulk
List-Id: Session Initiation Protocol <sip.ietf.org>

I have couple of questions/points on procedures related to Cancel method (I
don't recall whether SIP bis 04 is clear on that):
1. UAC sends Invite to UAS. UAS sends 200 OK to UAC. Meanwhile before the
200 OK is received by the UAC, it for some reason sends a Cancel to the UAS.
So what should happen in this glare situation? I assume the UAS will ignore
the Cancel since it has already sent the 200 OK. And the UAC, upon receiving
the 200 OK, should either send Bye to UAS or let the call connect sending an
ACK depending on the particular reason the Cancel was sent in the 1st time.
The Cancel, however, is not retransmitted. 
Or is there a different procedure? Which pages in which SIP RFC might have
talked about this?

2.  UAC sends Invite to UAS. UAS sends a response such as 200 OK but it is
improperly formatted. How should the sending side behave in this case? I
notice from SIP implementations that the UAC will send Cancel to UAS. 
It will be very helpful to have some kind of 'reason' header field in the
Cancel request so that the reason why the Cancel is being will be much
clearer. 

Thanks.

Since we did not get to Session Timer today...

There could be another issue with a 422 response (which may or may not
be intended or accepted as such).

You run into an interesting failure scenario if you have e.g. two
timer-aware proxies and a timer-unaware UAC as follows:

     UAC ----- P-A ----- P-B ------ UAS

Now consider P-A with a preferred session timeout of 10 minutes
(which it always inserts) and P-B with a preferred session timeout
of 15 minutes (which it always wants to insist on).

1.  UAC sends a simple INVITE w/o any session timer.
2.  P-A inserts Session-Expires: 600
3.  P-B detects that this value is too small and generates a

    422 Session Timer too small
    Session-Expires: 900

4.  P-A forwards this up the UAC

    The INVITE transaction has completed so P-A clears all state
    (there was no call established).

5.  The UAC receives 422 Response but does not understand it.
    Hence, the 422 defaults to 400 class response; no retry with
    different timer value is done.

    -> The UAS was not reached because of a client error which simply
       was not caused by the client.  In particular, the UAC has no
       idea what to do differently.

Interestingly enough, in the other direction, calls go through just
fine (assuming a UAS that supports timer).  A UAC supporting timer can
also initiate calls just fine.

A similar scenarion may arise if you have P-A always reducing the
Session-Expires: header below what P-B expects (even if the UAC
understands and uses Session-Expires:).  But this one is solved
by having Min-SE: in there set to the value desired by P-B in the
UAC.

Am I missing something?

Joerg

Yes, actually I agree that for my needs I will be using the mechanism of
accepting (200 OK) a call with an "on hold" SDP.
When the "acceptor" wants to get the caller off hold he will have to do it
explicitly...

Thanks,

Hello,

You can always accept (200 OK) a call with an "on hold" SDP. However,
there is no way to signal that you will place the call out-of-hold at a
particular time in the future.

It seems that you are looking for such a mechanism, right?

As Jonathan suggested, using the t line does not seem to be the right
approach. It is neither defined in the spec nor implemented by anybody.

Regards,

Gonzalo

The UAC must send the ACK, otherwise the UAS will re-transmit the 200-OK (it
ignored the CANCEL). After sending the ACK, the UAC can send a BYE.

Again, the UAC should send ACK, otherwise UAS will just keep sending the
200-OK. Also, it should send BYE, not CANCEL.

There was some discussion of a proposal to add a "Reason" header to the BYE
that would indicate why the session is being terminated. I'm not sure if
anybody is following up on this.

Hi Jonathan,

I really like the 18x/PRACK offer/answer model for early media. However, in
order in order to avoid the high (IMO) conceptual and programmtic complexity
of the potential overlapping invites (which I'm sure will result in only one
thing - a lot of people not implementing it fully) I have an alterative
suggestion.

Instead of having overlapping invites (when the caller wants to initiate a
media change), simply devise a mechanism to trigger the callee to resend a
18x early media offer. In this manner all the logic is re-used, all the call
setup is kept (seamlessly) in the same SIP transaction and it is a lot
conceptually simpler (which in my book counts for a lot). 

The simplest mechanism is to merely come up with a new method that the
caller sends - which has no state in itself - that simply causes the callee
to send another 18x early media SDP offer.

Robert.

On the one hand, I would love to find a generic mechanism for ordering and
detecting loss in overlapped non-INVITE content.  However, we hashed over
this issue in the SIP-events discussion.  Namely, content sequencing and
recovery is inherently content-specific.  Thus I would propose Strict
Sequencing (if needed) in the content, as Jonathan originally proposed.

Hi,

I'd like to announce a draft we have produced on the use
of an extensible authentication scheme for SIP. We hope
to be able to talk about this in the SIP Security Bar BOF
on Wednesday, and I believe it will also be touched upon
in the 3GPP presentation in the SIPPING WG.

Currently, SIP can use external security schemes such as
IPSec/IKE or TLS also for authentication, or one of the HTTP
and PGP methods within the protocol itself. As you know,
there is some ongoing work in the group to extend the HTTP
methods to better fit the requirements in the SIP case.
Also, AAA protocol extensions are under discussion in
the AAA WG in order to handle cases where the SIP node
doesn't store the authentication passwords by itself and
needs to talk to an authentication server over a protocol.

What we intend to add to this is one new HTTP/SIP authentication
method called HTTP EAP. Here we leverage an existing
protocol EAP (RFC 2284), originally developed for the PPP
world but nowadays being adopted also for WLANs and possibly
other places. EAP supports many authentication methods,
such password or token-card based, as well as PKI, GSM, and
UMTS AKA-based authentication schemes.

Originally, we started to think about an approach like
this as the 3G networks required the use of the UMTS AKA
authentication scheme (due to the deployed operator infrastructure
for handing out the authentication tokens for GSM/UMTS, and
the existence of the necessary technical components such
as the SIM cards already for other reasons). We could add
UMTS AKA authentication directly to SIP, but somehow we feel
that it would be better to add generic authentication to
SIP in one go, allowing various parties to use different
kinds of authentication methods they find suitable in
their situation. At the same time, an added benefit of
the EAP approach is that existing AAA protocols such as
DIAMETER and RADIUS can be used with less extension work,
as they already support EAP. Likewise, most SIP equipment
could in the future stay unchanged even if new authentication
methods are invented.

Draft: http://www.arkko.com/draft-torvinen-http-eap-00.txt
Presentation: http://www.arkko.com/sip_eap_ietf51.ppt

Feedback on this approach would be greatly appreciated,
particularly on its SIP applicability, soundness of security,
how to proceed with this in the IETF process, and the
relationship of this to the various security
proposals that the WG is now getting. We also look
forward to interesting discussions in general
about the SIP security framework.

Abstract

      This document describes a set of extensions to SIP [1] which=20
      allows a SIP UA to recommend an appropriate set of retransmission =

      timers to a called or calling UA in order to provide better=20
      service, and reduce network traffic in some networks where direct
      network bandwidth measurement is difficult or not possible by a=20
      UA. It does so by defining one new header, Session-Timers, which
      specifies the set of retransmission timers appropriate for that=20
      session. This new header is present in all 1xx and 2xx responses,
      as well as any SIP request message, but could be extended to new
      SIP request methods in the future.

1.0 Introduction
      When a SIP UA initiates a session with another UA which is =
located
      in a different network, or when a proxy is involved in the =
session=20
      creation (perhaps as a gateway between disparate network=20
      transports), the retransmission timer suggestions in SIP [1] may=20
      not apply well.=20
     =20
      For instance, a UA that normally operates in a 10Mbit network may
      not have appropriate timer settings for setting up a session to a
      UA that is located in a 56Kb network, and as a result of this=20
     =20
     =20

      could throttle the UA in the slower network with over-zealous=20
      retransmission of SIP messages.=20
     =20
      The SIP Timestamp header works to prevent this by including a =
base
      clock value that is echoed back by each UAS as the message=20
      traverses the network in order to determine appropriate=20
      retransmission timers at the UAC. This works well in a relatively
      homogenous network. Where problems arise is when a proxy is used=20
      as a gateway from a relatively "fast" network (i.e. 802.3, LAN,
      etc.) into a relatively "slow" network (i.e. CDPD, GPRS, etc.),=20
      which the initial Timestamp suggests a fast retransmission rate,=20
      when that rate is not appropriate to the final destination (which
      may take a significant amount of time to respond).

      In order to augment the operation of the Timestamp header, a new=20
      header is suggested that allows a UA to explicitly state what it=20
      thinks the appropriate retransmission timers are for the session=20
      (the values of T1 and T2). The UA receiving this information may=20
      wish to completely ignore it if it so chooses.


2.0 Header Field Definitions


      Table 1 specifies an extension of Table 5 in RFC-2543 [1] for the =

      new header defined here.

      Table 1: Definition of use of Session-Timers

           Header field	    where		proxy	ACK	BYE	CAN	INV	OPT	REG
           Session-Timers	R,1xx,2xx	amr	-	o	o	o	o	o


2.1 Session-Timers Header Parameters

      The Session-Timers header field MAY be included to RECOMMEND to a =

      client or server on a per-hop, per session basis, to use the=20
      retransmission timer values specified by in RFC-2543 [1], or an=20
      alternative that may be otherwise be used by that user agent. =
This=20
      header may be ignored if the user agent so chooses, and does not=20
      need to notify the sender in this case.

      If the user agent chooses to consider using the values specified=20
      in the header, then the following algorithm SHOULD apply =
(although
      a suitable alternative may be used):

      * Retransmission timers should never be "reduced" as a result of=20
        accepting a timer value from this header. If the user agent is=20
        already using a longer timer setting for that timer, the value=20
        of that timer suggested in the Session-Timers header should be=20
        ignored.
       =20
       =20
Stucker, Parameswar                                             [Page =
2]
=0C
Internet Draft            SIP Timer Preferences              August =
2001
       =20
      * If a timer has partially expired, and the value of the timer in
        the Session-Timers header is accepted for use, then the time=20
        elapsed for that timer on the user agent MUST be deducted from=20
        the timer value in the header before restarting the timer.
      * Timer values MAY change from response to response, and SHOULD =
be
        evaluated for possible use if the user agent has accepted any=20
        previous timer values.


      Table 2 specifies the parameters for the Session-Timers header.


      Table 2: Definition of use of Session-Timers

      Session-Timers =3D "Session-Timers" ":"=20
                       (( 1# (Timer-name "=3D" length)) * (";"))

      Timer-name =3D SIP [1] defined timer string
      Length =3D delta-milliseconds


      Example :

         Context-Timers: T1=3D800;T2=3D1200

         Would update timers T1 and T2 to 800ms, and 1200ms,=20
         respectively.

Hi,

Hopefully, when you read this mail all issues are solved, and the slides
aren't needed anymore... :)

Anyway, I do have a few comments, and I appologise that I weren't able
to post them before.

First, I didn't see any issue about the Record-Route, Outbound proxy,
and non-DNS UA issue. Did we solve that?

Second, I would like to know what people like about the idea of putting
the whole media handling, which I proposed earlier, in a separate draft.


Then, some comments on a few of the issues:


#11: Record-Routing non-INVITE mid-call

For this case I think it should also be clarified not only if we are
talking about non-routed mid-call requests, or if the proxy actually
REPLACES an existing route with another.


#71: RTT Estimation with Timestamp

My only question: Do we really need this on the application level? And,
if a UA wants to calculate the RTT, doesn't the time between sending the
request and receiving the response give a pretty good answer? Or, does
anyone really need, on the SIP level, to separate the time it took for
the request to reach the UAS and the time it took for the response to
reach the UAC?


#73: Responding to held SDP with held SDP

This is related to the issue how to put media on hold in the first place
(#133). Also, it depends on the "direction" of the call hold. For
example, if a UAC indicates a call hold with "a:inactive" I guess the
UAS can return a held SDP too (assuming it is able to put the call on
hold. But, if the UAC indicates it is only going to LISTEN to media, the
UAS can return the original SDP. And, if the UAC indicates it is only
going to SEND media, I guess the UAS can return the original SDP too.

Another approach would be to only send only the c= line and the
a:inactive (or whatever we will use) attribute, if we assume that the
call hold will not affect the codecs, ports etc used, and also assuming
that the whole session (ie all streams) will be put on hold.


#121: BYE/CANCEL Reason Phrases

A proposal is that this stuff could also be put in a separate draft
(compare to MEGACO). I am sure we going to come up with new codes in
future, and I don't think it's a good idea to write a separate extension
draft every time that happens (especially if there is no extension
feature attached). The only thing the bis then would have to specify is
the response code GROUPING, ie 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx and 6xx.


#122: CANCEL on 200/600 stength

I would like to apply this also for BYE, because a proxy may receive
200, but it doesn't want to accept THAT branch. For example, it may have
received 18x responses from other branches, or for whatever
security/authentication reason the proxy does not allow the leg for
which it received 200 to be established.


#130: BYE v. CANCEL

This proposal I like very much :) However, even if we allow BYE w/tags
we should not remove the BYE without tags - no matter if the call is
established or not.

Christer Holmberg

Hi Mukesh,

I am not really sure I understand your question, but I'll give it a try.

In SIP you can have multiple VIA headers. The ABNF, however, also allow
you to put all the values of those headers in a single header, separated
with a comma. I don't think I've ever seen it in real-world use, but it
is allowed.

Hi All,

Its a basic doubt .
Why r we having multiple values in VIA header ?
What is the significance of having it?
Also give situation when the proxy will add multiple value to VIA header?

Thanks in Advance,

Solution 1) Have P1 return a 503 with 
Retry-After of 1 second.  This is bad because 
the same proxies might not be in the path of 
the subsequent INVITE.  A might not submit 
the request with the same Call-ID.  A might 
not retry at all.

Solution 2) Define a new 5xx response which
means resubmit the request.  The response
would be basically mean the same as a 503;
however the resubmit should be immediate and
the proxies should record-route if they
wish to be part of the resubmit.  The resubmit
may use the same call-id with a higher cseq.
One problem is that this would require a bis
change.  Second problem is that the originator
would have to limit the resubmits to avoid
attacks and infinite resubmits.

Solution 3) Allow P1 to fork the same 
request to P2 but use a higher Session-Expires.  
This is bad because P2 potentially may not 
realize that it is a different request and 
assume that a forked request merged.  Thus the
same negative response might get returned.

Solution 3's problem is common for any 
merged forking situation where a proxy includes 
different headers or header values on the 
different branches.  This could be hopefully 
avoided by specifying in the bis that if a 
negative response was returned on a merged branch 
request, subsequent merged requests must still 
be checked to see if the same response applies.

I prefer solutions 3 if SIP intends to 
allow proxies to become smarter.

At best this is a hint; I'd call it such (like Timers-Hint).  Calling it
Session-Timers sounds like a request.  Yes, the implementer should read the
draft before implementing it, but that doesn't always happen :-(

I have a more fundamental issue with the concept.  How does the originating
UAC know about the network topology from the originating UAC to the
terminating UAC?  Likewise, what if each UAC has a high-speed connection to
their proxy, their proxy has a high-speed connection to an IP-IXC, but in
the middle of the IP-IXC, there's a slow connection?  Each UAC sees a
high-speed connection, so they won't give good hints.

The draft does hint (correctly) that this is a hop-by-hop issue.  The
parameter isn't a top-level (end-to-end) UAC attribute; it is hop-by-hop
(tie it to Via?  If so, how would it survive crossing proxy boundaries?  Is
that an issue at all?


Also, there's a typo in the example in section 2.1.  I presume that the
example should read
     Session-Timers: T1=800;T2=1200
and not
     Context-Timers: T1=800;T2=1200

Hi Christer,
	The Cisco Sip implementation (at least for their IP phones, the ones
I am working on are CISCO IP PHONE 7960/7940s) puts values from all the VIA
headers in a single header, separated with a comma.

Hi Mukesh,

I am not really sure I understand your question, but I'll give it a try.

In SIP you can have multiple VIA headers. The ABNF, however, also allow
you to put all the values of those headers in a single header, separated
with a comma. I don't think I've ever seen it in real-world use, but it
is allowed.

I don't know what happened when I sent this out yesterday, but it didn't
seem to make it. I don't know what happened. On the bright side, there were
some changes, and a new notice was probably in-order anyhow.

The following SIP-related adhoc meetings are currently scheduled:

Security -- Wednesday 1730-1930, Hilton rooms 7,8,9 -- (may change).
Firewall Traversal -- Thurs 1745-1900, Hilton Rooms 10,11,12
Privacy, Outbound Services from Remote Proxy (Source routing?) -- Thursday
2030-2300, Hilton rooms 7,8,9


Also, the Call Control session for late tonight has been cancelled at the
request of the organizers.

Call Control -- Wedneday 2200-2400, Hilton Rooms 7,8,9 -- CANCELLED

RE: [Sip] VIA Headerhi,

But i dont think any proxy adds two VIA header value at a time.
Am i right ?
i think putting of all VIA values in single VIA header might be taking place
at the last proxy server or UAS ?

Thanks,
Mukesh

  Hi Christer,
          The Cisco Sip implementation (at least for their IP phones, the
ones I am working on are CISCO IP PHONE 7960/7940s) puts values from all the
VIA headers in a single header, separated with a comma.

  Hi Mukesh,

  I am not really sure I understand your question, but I'll give it a try.

  In SIP you can have multiple VIA headers. The ABNF, however, also allow
  you to put all the values of those headers in a single header, separated
  with a comma. I don't think I've ever seen it in real-world use, but it
  is allowed.

This is for information only. This is not a work item of the SIP working
groups.

Some folks at Ubiquity and Columbia University have put together a first
draft on how to measure, in a repeatable fashion, some typical
performance metrics for SIP proxy, redirect and registrar servers. The
metrics are supposed to reflect common operational conditions; they are
not intended to test the functionality, protocol conformance, robustness
or overload behavior of the servers.

We will also provide a simple test tool that can be used to run these
tests, probably in early September.

The draft is at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/sip/drafts/sipstone.pdf

Since this is not of interest to all members of this list and is not an
IETF work item, I have set up a new list for the discussion of this
topic at

http://lists.cs.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/sipstone

Messages can be addressed to sipstone@cs.columbia.edu

The authors of the draft look forward to your comments and suggestions.

Henning

Hi
     I have a question on a statement in this draft:

It says  NAT will disappear with the deployment of Ipv6. Why is it so?

Regards
Ranjit

	Title		: NAT Friendly SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, J. Weinberger, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt
	Pages		: 32
	Date		: 24-Jul-01

In this draft, we discuss how SIP can traverse enterprise and
residential firewalls and NATs. This environment is challenging
because we assume here that the end user has little or no control
over the firewall or NAT, and that the firewall or NAT is completely
ignorant of SIP

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt".

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hello,
could i have a list of causes for error codes ?
If not possible to get all list, I would like to know a list of possible
causes when a SIP-server return a "404 - Not Found" error to a client.

Section 11 of draft rfc2543bis-04 contains that list.
Status code 404 is defined on page 67:

# The server has definitive information that the user does not exist 
# at the domain specified in the Request-URI.
# This status is also returned if the domain in the Request-URI does 
# not match any of the domains handled by the recipient of the 
# request.

	Cheers.
		Alberto.

We have custom SIP proxy product. As with every other proxy, we insert a the
proxy's Via header (with Via: and value) in the request message. So now we
have two Via headers (one for the proxy, one for the endpoint making the
request). When we get the response message back from the destination (a
Cisco 7960), there is only one Via header (with two value seperated by a
comma) in the message.

How exactly does that work, the phone is the endpoint. When it sends a
message it only has one via value (itself, or is it something to do with
multi-homing, etc). And when it receives a message it is not adding a value.
I am confused.
 
Just curious.

Hi Christer, 
        The Cisco Sip implementation (at least for their IP phones, the ones
I am working on are CISCO IP PHONE 7960/7940s) puts values from all the VIA
headers in a single header, separated with a comma.

Hi Mukesh, 

I am not really sure I understand your question, but I'll give it a try. 

In SIP you can have multiple VIA headers. The ABNF, however, also allow 
you to put all the values of those headers in a single header, separated 
with a comma. I don't think I've ever seen it in real-world use, but it 
is allowed.

Could you list some most valuable things you would like to change?

 Sorry to dredge up this thread again, but in reading through it, I didn't
get the impression there was consensus on what to do, and didn't notice
anything in bis-04 that addressed it.  Getting back to the original issue
that prompted it (though many varied needs were voiced), say we have a UA
that gets media it is not expecting as it has no corresponding session.  The
early consensus seemed to be to send ICMPs.

 The desire of that UA is to get the sender to stop the stream.  This is my
main concern with this thread.  The sender of the stream may desire to
attempt to re-establish the session, or may desire to kill the session it
believes was active and associated with the stream.  This seems to be an
implementation specific decision, though communicating that desire may be
something that is a protocol issue.  What should the UA sending the media do
when it gets ICMPs in either case?

 In my envirenment, I could live with either action taken by the UA, but
need some action(s) standardized, rather than the current inaction.  In the
first case (re-Invite), I would establish a new session which would likely
be to a different media address/port, and expect the UAC to stop sending to
the first port.  In the second case, I would send a 481 if a BYE for a
non-existent session was received.

 Note that there was discussion in the thread of sending a 481 response to a
re-Invite.  At least in my environment, we would send the ICMPs because we
have no session associated with the received stream.  Hence we may not have
state for that session, and would recognize the Invite as a new session and
not a re-Invite, so could not be expected to send a 481.

If a proxy considers the call down when the 481 is received, it will
just have to route the BYE that will be received later as an
out-of-the-blue BYE. Since the BYE will have record-route, I do not
think this is a major problem.

I perceive a strong weakness in the current SIP offer/answer model.

The problem pertains to the fact that the callee has no way of indicating
its media profile requirements. Consider the situation: 

A sends INVITE B with
m=audio 5454 RTP/AVP 0
m=video 4444 RTP/AVP 31

However the server only supports (or requires for this call) a different
profile, eg RTP/SAVP or some other transport profile (RTP/AVP-USCTP or TLS
or something). 

There is no way that the callee has to communicate this information to the
caller. This will be needed for proper deployment of SRTP on servers and a
great many other things.

- You cannot accept the call by setting the port to zero and then sending a
re-INVITE as you cannot be sure that the client supports this profile.
Answering calls successfully when you really don't have the ability to
communicate is something that we want to avoid at all costs (dead handset
syndrome). 

- It cannot be communicated in SIP headers as this is a layer violation (and
just bad design). You are trying to use the session protocol to signal he
required SDP transport paths.

- You could send a 4xx error with an SDP indicate the appropriate offer that
the caller should make to be successful. The requires more messages, longer
call setup times and new parsing & analysis logic of the SDP on the client
side. I don't like it.

I have a proposal: I think what we need is to allow a
offer/counter-offer/answer model. Now this sounds very familiar ->
Jonathan's new Early Media model! SDP in INVITE, callee instead sends
counter-offer in reliable provisional response, to which the caller either
accepts or rejects with the SDP in PRACK. When the 200 OK is eventually sent
by the callee it is in answer to the SDP in the PRACK (rather than original
INVITE).

I would like to see this generalized such that it can also be used with
local ringback (rather than removed as some have requested). 

Once again, I see this functionality as _absolutely_ crucial to the proper
deployment of SRTP and other SDP transport profiles. This also apples to the
situation where the callee needs to know whether the caller supports a
certain SDP capability (for instance, support for a particular SDP
attributes) - another very, very important case.

Please suggest something else if you don't like this scheme. 

[Jonathan proposed an alternate solution in the open issues section of his
early media draft:

	  .... We would then need a token in the 1xx somewhere
        which says "I ignored your offer of SDP in the INVITE, this
        2xx is an offer, not an answer". This token, perhaps a
        require token, would be present in the original 1xx but not
        1xx in response to re-INVITEs. We could apply this to
        INVITE/2xx/ACK as well.

We should try to make any scheme consistent and as long as it works I am not
bothered.]

Regards,

Robert.

P.S. I'm going to be away for the next couple of weeks (good duck and cover
tactic :-)

--------------InterScan_NT_MIME_Boundary
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="iso-8859-1"

Hi,

Now that the ROHC WG is looking at SIP compression between the
mobile and the proxy, I would like to discuss the possibility
of combining a SIP compressor with the SIP stack itself.

A "SIP-aware" compression algorithm such as EPIC performs the
compression by parsing a SIP message, converting text strings
to their Huffman equivalents. If we are performing compression
in the mobile and the SIP proxy then we can miss out the text
phase altogether, writing a SIP stack capable of reading and
outputting Huffman characters directly.

Motivation for combining the SIP compressor with the SIP stack
is that the processing overhead of compression is negligible,
or perhaps even negative (as Huffman characters are shorter
than their text equivalents, so there is less to read/output).

Comments on this suggestion would be appreciated, particularly
to check that it fits with the "protocol shim" for carrying
compressed SIP messages as proposed by Jonathan Rosenberg.

Regards,

Richard P

My comment would be this is an implementation issue and an obvious (?)
extension, if you make the the shim a "logical shim" for an optimised stack
this would work fine. I'd also note that it doesn't require both ends to make
the same implementation decisions.

Just as a careful wording reminder:
We aren't officially chartered yet to do this.
The WG chairs have seen some "general hallway nods" (can I patent this
term?) from the ADs, but until the charter is written, they can't say "yes".
This shouldn't stop us all from working on this, of course.

This is an implementation strategy question, not a question about the
interoperability of the standard (or do you think it is a
requirement/nice-to-have on the standard to allow this implementation
strategy?).
The strategy may make sense depending on a lot of factors, including
make-or-buy decisions on the SIP stack.

Hi,

I raised this issue to allay concerns that SIP compression
would be a significant resource drain on the proxy. If we
choose this implementation strategy then compression has no
processing overhead at all.

Only requirement on the standard is that it should be lightweight
enough not to preclude this implementation strategy!

Regards,

Richard P

To which I reply,
   (In the hypothetical case that SIP/Whatever Compression is chartered
    in time to be used for GERAN R5:)
Yup; It *is* an implementation issue. However, if someone can buy
in a stack (or develop one) that reduces the compression processing
requirements a lot, then this is going to be favourably received
by mobile phone manufacturers.

As Carsten points out, it is a "nice-to-have" to allow this
implementation option, and I'd be uncomfortable losing it.

The protocol and compression scheme will work regardless of
implementation option chosen, but it may calm some unhappy
people if we don't add a new feature requiring X Mips to
implement (for a change, they tell me :).

BR,
   Lawrence

Right, whereas, in section 4.4 WRITE HIGH is also shown as:

4.4 WRITE HIGH
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1|   index     |0|1|1| index   |   length      |  entry...

One of these has to be a typo, right?

Hi,

Yes, this is still compression because the output of a combined SIP
stack/SIP compressor is identical to the output of a standalone
compressor. Key difference between this and making SIP binary is that
the Huffman binary codes are made up by the compressor and do not
need to be standardized by the SIP WG: thus we avoid all of the
problems synchronizing between the text and binary encodings for SIP.

Regards,

Richard P

Figure 3 and Figure 5 of draft-rosenberg-sip-early-media-00 do not show the
correct handling of the 489 response (10) by the forking proxy. Figure 3
shows that the 489 response is forwarded immediately upstream by the forking
proxy. According to the bis draft, for 4xx/5xx response received by the
forking proxy, "the proxy MUST send an ACK. It remembers the response if it
has a lower status code class than any previous 4xx and 5xx response. On
completion, a response with the lowerst response class is returned if there
were no 2xx, 3xx or 6xx responses". A SIP bis-compliant forking proxy would
therefore silently discards this 489 response, and forwards only the 200 OK
(19) upstream to the UAC.

This brings us to a question concerning "early call leg". J. Rosenberg
proposed in an earlier SIP mail that "a 1xx with tags and record-routes
establish an early call leg. Within that early call leg, you can send
non-INVITE requests, including PRACK, INFO, BYE, etc., as you would for an
answered call leg". But how would the client be aware that the forking proxy
has received a non-2xx final response and as a result, that particular early
call leg has been terminated ?

We therefore propose the following slight modification of forking proxy
behavior to section 17.4 (Forking Proxy) of the bis draft :

Once the forking proxy has received and forwarded a provisional response
with a To tag upstream, it MUST forward upstream any final non-2xx responses
received on that branch, regardless of the responses received on the other
branches. On branches where no provisional responses with To tag were
received, the forking proxy behaves as usual, by selecting the "best
available final status" for those branches.

Hi,

I wasn't present during the ROHC WG meeting, so I don't
know if this is a moot question already. But what happened 
to the requirements? Specifically, is this going to be a 
generic protocol or SIP-only?

(I guess this will be clarified in the new WG charter
as well as in the meeting minute.)

BR,
Zhigang

Hello,

I sent the mail below some time ago and we had some discussion. I would
like to discuss this issue in depth now, in order to get the early media
draft stable.

Comments are welcome.

Regards,

Gonzalo

In page 25 of:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-new-03.txt

we have to add the following attribute:

a=inactive
    This specifies that the tools should be started in inactive
    mode.  This is necessary for interactive conferences where users can
put other users on hold. No media is sent over an inactive media stream.
It can be either a session or media attribute, and is not dependent on
charset.


When you make the change let us know, since RFC2543bis will have to be
updated as well.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

----------------

Minutes prepared by Dean Willis, based mostly on notes by Tom Taylor,
without whom we would cease to report.

SIP Working Group met at IETF 51 for two long sessions, a total of 5 hours
of meeting time. The revised was completed, with the exception that several
of the Rosenberg drafts listed in conjunction with alternative views were
not discussed in detail. Instead, Jonathan addressed only the significant
differences between his approach and the alternative presented.

We also scheduled three adhoc after-hours sessions:  1) Security, 2) Privacy
and Outbound Services from Non-Adjacent Proxies, and 3) Firewall Traversal.
A fourth adhoc on call Control was proposed by Rohan Mahy, but the proposal
was withdrawn before the meeting.

Slides are posted at: http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf51/slides/


Work Plan status
-----------------

Approximately half of the extant SIP drafts have been tentatively moved to
SIPPING.  The managed Last Call process is now starting to flow, and it
looks like we'll be able to work through the backlog. We have a near-term
requirement to reset several milestones, which will be executed on-list.


REFER Method
-----------------

This is part of the "call control" work, which addresses call transfers and
thrid-part all control. The existing draft draft-ietf-sip-refer-00.txt was
recently split off from the "transfer" draft. Open issues: 1) The "referred
by" information is similar to the Remote-Party-ID of the Privacy work. Can
these two share a general mechanism? 2) The draft defines a crude integrity
mechanism for referred-by, but this should use a general-purpose header
integrity mechanism. Consensus to advance draft by deleting integrity
mechanism and referring to SIP Security work. 3) The MIME-type of the REFER
body remains unresolved, and a number of security questions were raised with
various proposals.

Replaces Header
-----------------

This header indicates which call leg the call leg mentioned in a REFER is to
replace. This work is fairly mature, and no issues were raised.


SIP Events
-----------

Issues with authentication, 1) DoS attacks, and amplification, 2) Forking,
3) Record-Route, 4) Expires, 5) event package names, and 6) Call-leg
correlation, 7) partial-vs-full state transmission  were raised.

1 ) DoS/Amplification: Each SUBSCRIBE produces one response and one
notification, which could make a 2-to-1 amplifiier. Consensus to define
general "anonymous" authentication mechanism in bis.

2) Forking: No technical problems preclude support for forking of SUBSCRIBE
if forking of INVITES is supported.

3) Record-Route: current draft's wording seems ambiguos and has resulted in
variant interpretations. Consensus to clarify in revised draft.

4) Expires: Current draft overloads Expires header in NOTIFY to indicate
when subscription will expire. This is an overload of header. There is a
proposal to use a new header, Subscription-Expires, which may offeer
semantic advnatge in subscription migration. Weak consensus for propsal.

5) Event Package Names: Debate is to whether to allow private event package
names. Consenus seems to be to establish IANA registry on a first-served
basis, no RFC or expert review.

6) Call-Leg Correlation: Question is how to correlate a NOTIFY -- is it with
a "call" or a "call leg".  This is mostly an issue on whether or not
SUBSCRIPTIONS are initated within an extsing call leg. Current draft
correlates with a call leg, but this may not solve all cases. Conensus to
examine removing prohibition on mapping between notification and specific
call as to whether this affects existing implementation semantics.

7) Partial vs. Full State transmission: Most interpretations of existing
work seem to indicate that NOTIFYs will contain full states (SHOULD). State
deltas may be  important for many applications, but are problemactic in
constructing full state because of possible missed messages. Consensus to
consider body versioning techniques for state deltas.


Early Media
-------------

Many open issues, primarily with telephony interworking and QoS. Fundamental
architecture issue is that early media is "forced" not "offered", and as a
consequence we have no effective negotiation mechanism. This all seems to
derive from need to map PSTN behavior exactly, and can be resolved if
different user interface is allowed. There will be a lot more discussion on
this topic.


NAT Friendliness
------------------

Current proposal includes several techniques for symmetric and semisymmetric
NATS, including new SIP Translate header with semantics of  "I don't know
where I am, please use the address and port this came from".  Consensus to
split into at least two drafts,  including Translate header (question: do we
need a charter adjustment or new milestone declared here?) and seperate "NAT
detection protocol for RTP" to be pursued outside SIP.



SIP SRC Indication
-------------------

Propsal to include source IP address in port in SDP describing sesion, and
to expicitly differentiate RTCP port information. This would allow building
SIP ALGs and firewalls much more easily (esp. "line" as opposed to "cone"
binding devices), as much less information would have to be deduced. It also
reduces the opportunity for RTP port spamming, as attacker would have to
know source IP and port as well as SSRC. However, it poses complications for
current simple-NAT proposals. There will be further discussion of this
topic.


Extended HTTP-type-Authentication
-------------------------------------

Discussion included drafts from Rosenberg and Undery. The basic idea is
finding ways to get more mileage, such as mesage integrity protection, out
of digest autnetication techniques already specified in SIP. This has all
sorts of open isses. Furtehr discussion moved to Security ad-hoc and to
mailing list, with no clear consensus reached in the meeting.


Proxy-Supported Negotation
------------------------------

Idea is to determine whether at least one proxy in signaling path supports a
specific feature. Existing negotiation technique can detect if ALL proxies
in path support a feature. There has been ongoing list debate as to whether
this is needed. Consensus reached in meeting that no requirement for this
behavior, such as a specific application, has been identified and that work
on the approach can be deferred until such time as a requirement has been
identified.


Reliability of Provisional Messages
-----------------------------------

Alternative mechanism to 100Rel proposed. List discussions had been
inconclusive. Consensus from meeting that proposed alternative offers no
significant advantage in general case.


Session Timer
--------------

Two open isses: 1) New draft allows lower-bounding on sesssion-timer.
Current proposal is to overload session-expires, with suggestion to
establish new error code like 422-Minimum-Session-Expires. Consenus on
proposal for new error code. 2) Absolute vs. relative timers. Consensus to
deprecate absolute timers.


SIPbis Open Issues
--------------------

A bug tracking system is being used to track the large number of open issues
in the bis draft. The meeting discussed several issues and attempted to get
consensus for various propsed resolutions.

1) Issue 7: Allow CANCEL for non-INVITE methods.  Current spec has muliple
interpretations. Weak consensus to clarify indicating use of CANCEL only
with INVITE.

2) Issue 10: Use of maddr: If client sends INVITE using maddr paremeter from
route, should it strip the maddr off of the generated request URI? Consensus
is yes, as documented in rfc2453-bis-03.

3) Issue 11: Record-routing for mid-call methods other than INVITE.  This is
intertwingled with Issue 138. Conensus is to allow mid-call record
record-route on a case by case basis.

4) Issue 138: Forking of non-INVITE requests: Consensus to allow forking for
non-INVITE methods on a case-by-case basis.

5) Issue 20: Mixing unicast & multicast in offer/answer . If offer SDP
contains uni, can response contain multi? Proposal: general rule: answer
should be something offeror can do.  Hence don't send multicast in respons
to unicats. If required, re-INVITE. Conensus to acdept proposal and add
scenario to conferencing models draft.

6) Issue 23: dynamic PT reuse. SDP usage in 2543 says you can't reuse a
dynamic PT number used previously for a different codec type. This limits
number of codecs in a call to 127. It should be possible to reuse a PT once
the transaction in which it was used has been completed. Consensus that this
is not yet an issue for SIP and therefore there is no need to change.

7) Issue 146: Reuse disabled streams. SDP usage spec says once you have
disabled a stream by setting port = 0that hat stream cannot be reused. This
is important to maintain exlpicit ordering of codecs, but means the SDP size
keeps increasing in on-off hold operations. Proposal: cannot remove disabled
stream  But if new one added, can take disabled stream's slot within SDP.
No restriction on media type. This preserves ordering without increasing
size of SDP. FID discussed as possible solution, but this doesn't seem to
work completely. Further discussion is required.

8) Issue 58: Rejected mid-call SDP in 2xx: Question is what to "fall back
to".  Proposal to use general approach of using some signalling means to say
that previous session description should be rtetained.  Jonathan will
consider in revised draft.

9) Issue 133: on-hold indication: Current SDP usage for on-hold is to set
address/port number of all 0. This turns out to break RTCP, is IPv4
specific, and is generally ugly. Proposal to use a=inactive for non-sending
codecs and a=sendonly for sending codecs, and preserve backward
compatibility by accepting but not sending all-zeroes.  This may have
implications for QoS, and requires further analysis.


SIP Security Work Plan
------------------------

We are beginning to see common themes in security questons that suggest a
possible path for generalization. Proposal to seperate discussion of
"outside" vs. "inside" attacks and advance independently. This would include
basic "outside" defenses like IPSec and TLS in rfc2543bis. The HTTP-derived
authentiation mechanisms would be reqtined in bis, and all other security
considerations seperated. Individual extensions would be constrained from
proposing cryptosolutions pending general solutions.

Work Program: Develop Threats and Requirments draft. Finalize base
requirments in bis and feeze. Define framework for popular auth mechnisms
and focus on simple scheme provising UA-Proxy and Proxy-Proxy protections
aliged with SRTP and SDP work.

Hi,

I'm currently doing some work on the requirements document to fit the
comments that I received from the list before the London meeting. But I'll
wait for the meeting minutes to see if there is a need for additional
changes.

I've made the change to my working copy, and will try to submit a revision
in the next couple of weeks (there are a few other changes in progress).

Hi,

Yes, this is still compression because the output of a combined SIP
stack/SIP compressor is identical to the output of a standalone
compressor. Key difference between this and making SIP binary is that
the Huffman binary codes are made up by the compressor and do not
need to be standardized by the SIP WG: thus we avoid all of the
problems synchronizing between the text and binary encodings for SIP.

Regards,

Richard P

Hi,

If a combined SIP stack/SIP compressor cannot be used for whatever
reason, then feel free to implement a standalone SIP compressor
instead. The output of the compressor is identical in both cases.

Regards,

Richard P

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SCTP as a Transport for SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne, G. Camarillo
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-sctp-00.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 15-Aug-01
	
This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol) as the transport between SIP entities.
SCTP is a new protocol which provides several features that may prove
beneficial for transport between SIP entities which exchange a large
amount of messages, including gateways and proxies. As SIP is
transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively
straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sctp-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-sctp-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sctp-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Could someone please explain to me:

	15.4 If a UAS never receives an ACK for a 2xx response to a
re-INVITE, it SHOULD generate a re-INVITE
	itself in order to synchronize the state of the session.

What does this description mean? If UAS needs a ACK, why it has to generate
a re-INVITE?

Thanks and Regards

I think this is not the reason, because the original re-INVITE is sent by
UAC not UAS.

I think in order to re-negotiate the session. The 2xx message itself or the
ACK could have been lost. Since we can not know what have been lost, the
negotiation should start from the beginning.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Well, one use of a re-INVITE is to change the media characteristics of
an existing session.  So if a UAS never gets acknowledgement of its
response (times out waiting for the ACK), it can (SHOULD) assume the
transaction failed and continue with the media that existed prior to the
re-INVITE.  But, the other end has already changed presumably to match
its re-INVITE and it may have even received the 200 from the UAS in
which case it did change its media, leading to a "failed call" situation
(UAC using new media and UAS using old media).  The text you ask about
describes a fall-back procedure for the UAS to "recover" the call.  The
UAC is not aware of the problem with the UAS receiving its ACK.

Bert

Could someone please explain to me:

	15.4 If a UAS never receives an ACK for a 2xx response to a
re-INVITE, it SHOULD generate a re-INVITE
	itself in order to synchronize the state of the session.

What does this description mean? If UAS needs a ACK, why it has to
generate
a re-INVITE?

Thanks, I understand your explaination. But why Bis04 says that this is to
synchronize the state of the session? Maybe some other reason as well.

Hi:

I remember that in the MMUSIC meeting in London, Jonathan mentioned that RFC 2543bis depends on the new SDP draft. However, RFC 2543bis-04 references RFC 2327 (classic SDP). Is this going to be fixed in new versions of RFC 2543bis? Or am I missing something?

Thanks a lot,

      Miguel

Hello,

Does this following behaviour (to encrypt before authenticating) of SIP open
up some security holes, because now you can send the encrypted body with
valid signature even if you are not the original creator of that content?

   "Note that if a message is encrypted and authenticated using a digital
   signature, when the message is generated encryption is performed
   before the digital signature is generated. On receipt, the digital
   signature is checked before decryption."

Have you thought about this situation?

Regards, Rami Lehtonen

Sorry I don't quite follow why this is a problem, people often sign things they
didn't create, if you don't trust it don't sign it.

digital signatures are not an appropriate security means to prove ownership of content. But that particular problem is definitely not a SIP security issue.

	That might be the problem, because now we don't know who actually created
	the content. It might be a problem also in case where the body contains some
	sensitive information like the following example:

	If there is e.g. a pre-paid ticket for some service in the body part, C
	could capture that message sent originally by A, remove the signature and
	include C's own signature and then send the message to B. Now B thinks that
	C originally paid money for the service, because there is C's signature and
	the content is encrypted using the B's public key as it should be.

	Anyway this was just a thought. I was just curious to hear if somebody has
	considered this as an authentication problem or not.

Hi,

Attached is a (rather detailed) posting on the overhead of
encapsulating EPIC within UDPComp. The conclusion is that by adding
Huffman codes to UDPComp, the protocol overhead can be made very
low (just 5 bytes per message).

Comments are welcome!

Richard P

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a follow-up to my earlier posting on the performance of
various signaling compression algorithms. I mentioned that one of the
ideas of UDPComp is to make the compression algorithm a local
implementation decision at the compressor: this makes the protocol
very lightweight and flexible, but potentially reduces the compression
efficiency due to transmitting the semantics of the compression
algorithm in each packet.

As promised, here are some performance figures to illustrate this
overhead. We tested the EPIC algorithm encapsulated in UDPComp using
the "Simple SIP to SIP" flow from <draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-05.txt>.

We assume that the compressor and decompressor each contain a static
dictionary of text strings commonly used in SIP. This can be "learnt"
by compressing sufficient SIP messages, or alternatively can be fixed
a-priori. We also use a dynamic dictionary (i.e. compress relative to
previous messages in the flow).

Note that UDPComp offers significant flexibility in the choice of
"token" used to transmit text strings from the compressor to the
decompressor. Currently the scheme sends a fixed 1-2 byte index to
reference each text string, but additional tokens can easily be added
(for example tokens that use Huffman codes to reference text strings).
We have provided a range of performance figures using different types
of token to transmit the data.

For comparison, the compression ratio using only the existing UDPComp
tokens is given below:

EPIC algorithm with no encapsulation:                   9.78

UDPComp using existing tokens only:                     1.17

The decrease in compression ratio is caused by sending a 1-2 byte index
to reference each text string. In contrast, the EPIC algorithm usually
references a text string by sending a short Huffman code (typically
1 - 4 bits).

To improve the compression ratio it is possible to add Huffman codes to
UDPComp. In general this is straightforward: the only potential problem
is that the Huffman codes are chosen specifically for EPIC, and different
variants of Lempel-Ziv may need a different set of Huffman codes. Thus,
it may be necessary to download new sets of Huffman codes to the
decompressor depending on the choice of algorithm.

Adding Huffman codes to UDPComp can be done in several ways. Firstly
we have a choice between EPIC-LITE (which uses ordinary Huffman codes)
and EPIC (which uses a special version of Huffman encoding capable of
compressing text strings down to less than one bit - for example 3
common text strings in a row might together be indicated by sending a
single "0" bit).

Secondly, we have a choice between selecting a global set of Huffman
codes for all text strings, and using a different set for each dictionary
entry. In the latter case the Huffman code for each text string actually
changes depending on the previously received string. This improves the
compression ratio at a cost of higher memory requirements (which may be
a problem if we have to store the Huffman codes in working memory).

Compression ratios for each choice are given below:

UDPComp using EPIC-LITE with global Huffman codes:      5.90

UDPComp using EPIC-LITE with local Huffman codes:       6.29

UDPComp using EPIC with global Huffman codes:           6.85

UDPComp using EPIC with local Huffman codes:            8.24

Initial results are promising: if required we can make the overhead of
encapsulating EPIC within UDPComp negligible (essentially it is just
the 5 bytes of initial UDPComp header per message). I believe the next
step should be to check how other compression algorithms fit into the
UDPComp framework, and to decide on a "sweet spot" between compression
efficiency and standardizing the protocol in the given timeframe.

Richard,

I'm a bit puzzled by the numbers. According to your own data sent
earlier (http://www.cdt.luth.se/robhc/msg02428.html), even a
generic LZSS can achieve a compression ratio of 9.87 with a combined
dictionary. What is the point here?

BR,
Zhigang

Hi Hans,

Since the SIP Call set up latency is one of the main (if not the main)
problem we want to solve with signaling compression, I propose we add a
requirement to that effect:

The compression scheme MUST be such that when applied to SIP, the call
set up latency is less than X seconds, for a representative set of
scenarios to be defined. Scenarios specify the messages exchanged, their
contents, as well as the channel bit rates. 

We need to agree on X and the scenarios, but I believe this requirement
is useful, because compression ratio alone does not adequately capture
the problem of call set up latency. Scenarios can be based on those
typically envisioned in cellular cases like 3GPP.

Khiem

Hi,

I'm currently doing some work on the requirements document to fit the
comments that I received from the list before the London meeting. But
I'll
wait for the meeting minutes to see if there is a need for additional
changes.

To which I reply:
Hi Folks,
   There is a GERAN meeting at the end of the month, and I will canvas
to see if there is a HARD limit such as that proposed as a requirement.

However...
I think that the assumption that the main goal of SIP Comp is to reduce
(or, as described above, =>LIMIT<= ) the call set up time is not obvious
(to me, at least) and I'm not yet happy to have it included in the
requirements document as proposed.

For GERAN at least, the HARD requirement is on the mid-call Re-Invite
sequence, NOT on the call set up. That's probably true for UTRAN as well,
but that's not my area of interest.

I have already sent a posting on my understanding of the GERAN mid-call
problem and the figures that seem to apply there (and the reasons).

Of course one benefit of SIP Comp is that we reduce the transmission
time for messages sent during call set up for latency reasons, and so
we may avoid too many re-transmissions of SIP messages. However, I don't
see how this is a HARD requirement and would be interested in understanding
the logic here.

Do we have a specific limit (like the DCS one that is, I believe, regulated
by the FCC)?

BR,
  L.

Please help. 

I was at the IETF meeting in London and I am missing a blue zippered bag
containing a USB cable as in the picture attached. Contents also included a
Motorola 2-way pager.

I had it on the night of Thursday August 9 at 12 midnight between the
computer room and the 4th floor telephones.

My name and address are on the inside of the bag.

If  found please return to the address below.
Thank you.

Dear all,
 
I'm new in the domain of VoIP and SIP, and while reading SIP (RFC 2543) and
RFC2543bis-04 I encountered a problem with the contents of table 4.

The problem is how to understand the table correctly.
For example: The first line specifies that the "allow" header can occur in
all Request messages except in the ACK, because the WHERE column indicates
R, and in each column related to an individual Request the "o" indicates
that it is optional, except for the ACK. The second line specifies that it
can occur in response 415, but how should I interpret the "o" fields in the
columns concerning the Request messages (INVITE? REGISTER, ...) ?

A second problem, related to this is that headers, marked as response (e.g.
warning) also have the "o" (optional) indication in all Requests. Does this
mean that this respone header could also be present in a Request ?

kind regards

Hi,

The discrepancy is because the second set of compression ratios does
not include a user-specific dictionary. In this case, the compression
ratio for the EPIC algorithm with no protocol overhead is 9.78 (vs
15.53 including a user-specific dictionary).

The purpose of the second set of compression ratios is to check the
protocol overhead of UDPComp. This may be quite substantial because
UDPComp employs a standard decompressor, not specifically optimized
for any one particular compression algorithm.

At present the decompressor doesn't even understand Huffman encoding,
so an explicit 1-2 byte index has to be sent for each text string
instead. This reduces the compression ratio as follows:

No encapsulation at all:                              9.78

UDPComp encapsulation:                                1.17

Fortunately it is pretty easy to add Huffman encoding to UDPComp, and
the protocol overhead is reduced substantially. For the most powerful
variant of Huffman compression the overhead is as follows:

UDPComp encapsulation with Huffman encoding:          8.24

This is a much lower overhead (5 bytes per compressed message).

Regards,

Richard P

Hi Richard,
I have a few comments to the performance figures when EPIC (or some other
compression algorithm) is encapsulated in UDPComp. As defined in the draft
UDPComp is unidirectional. This means that all messages from the "Simple SIP
to SIP" flow from <draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-05.txt> can't be used in the
dynamic dictionary, only previous messages sent in the same direction as the
current message. This would have significant impact on the performance
figures,  I believe.
Another thing which I think will have impact on the performance is the choice
of tokens. For example, the READ-token has nothing to do with dictionary/code
book management, it just says ''read from a certain place in the dictionary
and append this to the decompressed message''. But this is typically what the
references in  Lempel-Ziv compression algorithms mean. In practice this means
that we are using two tokens with the same meaning to read a string from the
dictionary, surely one token would be sufficient? I guess the there is room
for plenty of discussion on what types of tokens are needed to support both
the different compression algorithms that people would like to use and maybe
also to support the kind of dictionary/code book manipulations that are
desired.

Regards,
Jan Christoffersson

Still, the numbers indicate that with a combined dictionary (including
user-specific) can easily boost the compression ratio to close to 10,
even for the generic approach like LZSS (I would assume LZW will
have similar result). Then, shouldn't we assume a combined dictionary 
in all comparisons?

Hi,

I like the idea of having some defined scenarios to be able to compare the
scheme against and those scenarios could be included in the requirements
document, but perhaps not under the requirements section, but under the
"assumptions" section.

We have already some message sequences (thanks to Richard and Ishita) that
we could use. What we need to do now is just find out some representative
channel bitrates to run these against. Maybe someone could provide some
channel bitrates?

Are there other "message exchange sequences" that someone thinks are more
representative than those already used?

Hi Hans,

Are the message sequences you get from Richard and Ishita
based on draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-05.txt or 3GPP TS
24.228? Were they sent to the mailing list?

BR,
Zhigang

Hi,

How about we start with 9.6 kbps both uplink and downlink and use  UMTS
frames to estimate the call set up delay? We can then slowly progress to
14.4 kbps and then 144 kbps to have a comparative analysis between
compression ratios and faster channels? After that we can incorporate
processing delays/queueing delays at both sender and receiver assuming one
is a Mobile and the other is a P_CSCF.

As I said with TCCB, the compression ratio improves with each successive
call between the same user agents. 

Here are some suggestions of scenarios.and performance parameters.
a) User A calling User B  (compression ratio, call et up delay improvement)

b) User A receiving a call from User C
c) User A calling User B (again)

In order to do the delay analysis, we not only have to use the same scenario
but also be sure that we use the same Protocol stack as specified in the
3GPP docs so that we add the correct header size to tha application layer
messages for all the successive layers beneath. Also it would be interesting
to know just how much more gain we get with SIP compression +UDP/IP  header
compression.

I could provide the numbers probably by Thursday so we can have a rough idea
what the numbers look.

Comments are welcome.

Thx,
Ishita

Hi,

I like the idea of having some defined scenarios to be able to compare the
scheme against and those scenarios could be included in the requirements
document, but perhaps not under the requirements section, but under the
"assumptions" section.

We have already some message sequences (thanks to Richard and Ishita) that
we could use. What we need to do now is just find out some representative
channel bitrates to run these against. Maybe someone could provide some
channel bitrates?

Are there other "message exchange sequences" that someone thinks are more
representative than those already used?

Hi Zhigang,

I read Ishita's mail too quickly. Thus, we currently only have one message
sequnce, section 3.1.1 Successful Simple SIP to SIP, from
draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-05.txt.
If you could provide more sequences it would be good.

Hans,

Attached is a message sequence for mobile-originated call
scenario in 3GPP (sorry about the size, ~6K). It was based=20
on 3GPP TS 24.228 (v0.4.0 March/2001): "Signaling flows for=20
the IP multimedia call control based on SIP and SDP".=20

It was generated back in April when we started the test.
Recently, there is a new version (v1.2.0 July/2001) of
TS 24.228 released. So, some updates might be needed.
But the basic sequence is still the same.=20

If time allowed, we probably need another sequence for mobile-
terminated call, which can be found in the same document.

BR,
Zhigang

PS. I noticed that the lines in the files are terminated by LF=20
instead of CRLF (as it should be). I guess it was messed up=20
during the transfer between Windows and Linux.

Hi,

I did review the IETF draft and found following changes maybe required:

1.  Move 'Table of Contents' to either page 2 or after Introduction section.
2.  Function names are too long. Should be shortened; or subnames should be
      spaced out -- by underscores, etc. -- to improve readability.
      For instance:

      matchuriparameters could be changed to
      match_uri_parameters or matchUriParameters


3.  Section 5.2 Accep-Contact header syntax vs example:

      Accept-contact defines rule is:
        * [*(";" (cp-params | q-param | scheme-param | strength)) ]
      Thus rule in example should have been:
        Accep-Contact: sip:sales@acme.com ; q=0; *;media="!video"; *;q=0.1 ..
        and so on..
      This implies q-params should be followed by ';' instead of ','.
      Also, except for first q-param, all subsequent q-params should be
      prepended by '*;'

      (Maybe I have understood the example :( )

There was an ad-hoc on firewall traversal at IETF 51. I literally couldn't
get in the room -- it was too full.  Guess it was a hot topic . . .

So, whoever took the notes and attendance (Somebody Took Notes, Right?)
please send them to me. Thanks.

I would argue that there are two goals of SIP or UDP compression.

1) To reduce the bandwidth used by SIP messaging, especially non-session
messaging such as REGISTERS and the like.
2) To reduce the serialization delay through very slow connections such as
wireless. This impacts call setup time, mid call event processing, and call
teardown. It further impacts the jitter induced by mixed signaling and media
on a non-interleaving connection such as traditional PPP.

If the UAS never receives the ACK after having retransmitted its 200 OK
several times, it seems that the signalling path is broken. So, I
would think the a re-INVITE transaction started by the UAS in that case
is doomed to fail as well. To me it seems more logical to tear down the
session in this case.

Michel

Hi,

Good point about the unidirectional nature of UDPComp. Since there is
currently no shared information between the two flow directions, the
dynamic dictionary takes longer to populate. I have rerun the
simulations using the unidirectional flows only - results are below with
the results for a shared dynamic dictionary given for comparison:

                                Unidirectional flows      Shared flows

No encapsulation at all:                6.72                  9.78

UDPComp encapsulation:                  0.80                  1.17

UDPComp with Huffman (type A):          4.04                  5.90

UDPComp with Huffman (type B):          4.41                  6.29

UDPComp with Huffman (type C):          4.65                  6.85

UDPComp with Huffman (type D):          5.96                  8.24

Concerning the choice of tokens to provide in UDPComp, we have one set
of results using the existing UDPComp tokens only, as well as 4 sets of
results using tokens generated by different variants of Huffman encoding. 
For an explanation of the 4 types of Huffman encoding please see my
original email below.

Note that the Huffman tokens replace the original READ token as they
basically have the same function, and providing both types simultaneously
would be inefficient.

Regards,

Richard P

Hi,

Does UDPComp currently have the ability to support a user-specific
dictionary? If no additional effort is required then we should certainly
assume a combined dictionary in all comparisons.

If UDPComp needs to be modified then we should compare results with and
without a user-specific dictionary - if the gain in compression efficiency
is big enough then we can make the necessary modifications to UDPComp.

Regards,

Richard P

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Mapping of ISUP Overlap Signalling to SIP
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Roach, J. Peterson, L. Ong
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-overlap-01.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 20-Aug-01
	
This document describes a way to map ISUP overlap signalling to SIP.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-overlap-01.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-overlap-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-overlap-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi,

I agree with you that subsequent signaling transactions are likely to
fail under network conditions that resulted in the ACK never arriving at
the UAS.  However, there may be situations in which a re-INVITE in the
reverse direction may succeed.  There are also other uses of re-INVITE,
such as session-timer, that the procedure described can add value to.
Others more experienced with SIP than myself can better provide the
motivation behind the text asked about.

I suppose the authors feel it is better to attempt (at least once) to
recover the session instead of dropping it right away.  I myself
interpret the text asked about as exhibiting this philosophy, with which
I agree.  I also suspect this is the "best" approach for all uses of
re-INVITE, and is preferable to defining a procedure for each case.

regards,
Bert

Folks,

I was in the process of updating the session timer draft, getting it ready
for IESG, when I happened across several additional issues. For one, there
is a reasonable solution, but the other is more serious and requires some
discussion. Sigh...

Issue #1
--------

The 422 response code allows a proxy to reject a request with a
session-expires which is too low. It includes a Min-SE header with the
minimum value that it is willing to accept. According to the current draft,
the client is supposed to insert the Min-Se header into an INVITE, and the
value is:

   the value MUST be the largest
   value amongst all Session-Expires values returned in 422 responses on
   that leg. 

This wording is imprecise, since a leg won't have been established when you
get a 422 to the initial INVITE. As I was rewording this, I realized that
you might get a bunch of 422's before the call is setup, from proxies that
aren't eventually in the path of the final call leg (because of forking,
primarily). 

Consider the case where A calls B, and there is a Session-Expires in the
INVIITE A sends, with value 50. THis hits proxy X, which forks to Y and Z. Y
returns a 422 with a Min-SE of 10000, and Z returns a 422 with a Min-SE of
75. The proxy forwards one of them arbitrarily, say the one from Y. The
client should retry the request with a Min-SE header in the INVITE, with
value 10000, and a Session-Expires of 10000. This once again forks to Y and
Z. Its OK by Y, but not by Z, so Z returns 422 with value 75. The fork from
Y returns a 486, so the proxy forwards the 422 upstream (there is another
issue here, which is that if Z returns a 408, the proxy will forward the
408, and then thats it - call failure. Ideally, the proxy should have
forwarded the 422 so that the client can retry the request. This is a
generic problem, not specific to session timer, regarding which messages a
proxy chooses to forward upstream). Anyway, the UAC gets that 422 with a
Min-SE of 75, and then retries the request with a value of Min-SE of 10000,
and Session-Expires of 10000. Once again, it forks through Y and Z. THe
branch through Z returns a 200 OK. Now, in refreshes to the session, the
Min-SE will always be present with a value of 10000. THis is veyr large, and
way above the minimum required by the proxies on the path of the call leg
established through Z.

My fix for this is that the client uses the max of the Min-SE amongst all
422 in all responses for a particular CALL before any call legs are
established. Once a call leg is established, it uses the max of the min-SE
returned in all 422 responses for that call leg (i.e, with the same tag as
the 2xx that created the leg). As a result, when the call is accepted, the
max of the Min-SE is effectively "cleared", and then can be reset to the max
of the Min-SE on the path of the call leg. This seems to work fine.

ISSUE #2
--------

The big problem occurs when the 422 is used when the client doesn't support
session timer.

So, the client sends an INVITE, and it knows nothing of session-timer. A
proxy inserts a Session-Expires into the request (which it is allowed to
do). It uses a Session-Expires of value 100. A downstream proxy thinks that
this is too small, so it rejects the request with a 422, and a Min-SE of
200. This hits the client. But, since the client doesn't know the session
timer, the result is a call failure, since it won't know to retry the
request with the Min-SE header present. Oops.

Now, we can mandate that 422 is returned only when the Supported header was
present in the INVITE. But, this means that sessions can be setup with
really low session timers. That seems bad.

A better solution (soln 1) is to mandate that when there is no Supported
header, a proxy cannot insert a session timer value lower than a specific
minimum (namely, 30 minutes), and that no proxy server can reject a request
with a 422 if the session timer is larger than 30m (i.e., there be a maximum
minimum session expiration). 

Another option (soln 2) is this. A proxy can insert both a Session-Expires
and Min-SE into the request. If a proxy sees a request without a Supported
header, but with a Session-Expires header below its minimum, it can insert a
Min-SE header into the request before proxying it (although it can't
increase the session timer). When this hits the UAS, if it sees a
session-expires with a value lower than min-se, it uses the value from
min-se instead of the value in session-expires. 

Soln 1 is simpler, but can result in sessions being established with large
session timers even though smaller ones are possible and desired. Solution 2
sets up the session with the right timer value, but requires further special
case processing.

I would probably recommend solution 2, but I don't feel strongly and am not
sure the complexity is worth it.

Comments?

To me, yes, the user-specific dictionary is just a matter 
of pre-population (of entries in codebook for LZW, or byte 
array for LZSS). The effort should be much less than 
that of adding Huffman Coding (especially if it is dynamic).
See more comments below.

The results are already shown from various sources (you, Hans
and us). Quoting your number (from 1.17 to 9.87), I would say 
the gain is big. And more important, the associated complexity 
is almost trivial. We can simply use the existing WRITE to 
pre-populate the codebook, plus a flag indicating no message 
should be delivered to the upper layer. Furthermore, it is 
generic and no SIP knowledge is assumed. 

Should we apply the same standard on all approaches, including 
EPIC?

BR,
Zhigang

Write high and write high reference are not the same. Write high reference
creates a new codebook entry by concatenating existing entries. Write high
simply creates a new one from the enclosed text.

Solution 2 sounds fine.  The same solution works 
for when the UAS thinks Session-Expires was too 
small.  The UAS would use its own Min-SE for the 
Session-Expires instead of rejecting with a 422.

Yes, yes, yes! This is exactly the direction that I was arguing for at IETF.
The idea with UDPComp is that you define a very general purpose decoder,
define a protocol for conveying commands to the decoder, and then allow the
implementors to choose an encoding mechanism that utilizes the facilities
and capabilities of the decoder and protocol. THis is much like the way
compression is done for video and audio, where the decoder is really simple,
and the compression lies within the encoder.

What Richard is proposing here are some new capabilities to add to the
protocol/decoder (namely, support for Huffman codes). I think this is the
tact we should take - examination of capabilities to add in order to find
the right sweet spot between compression efficiency and flexibility. I think
that this will ultimately be much more fruitful than needless bantering
about whose proposal supports what capabilities, and the relative
performances under some two dozen call flows. That kind of approach will
mean we never finish in time for the 3g deliverables.

Now, I have some comments on how I would incorporate Huffman codes into
UDPComp, which are very detailed, and I will post separately.

Richard is exactly correct that the cost of a general purpose decompressor
like this is a hit in overhead. With purely static codebook indices, the
overhead is quite large as the results below show. I agree totally that some
kind of Huffman coding is needed. I have been thinking about this, and I
have a proposal that is different from what Richard is proposing.

My proposal would be to make the support for huffman coding very general
purpose, and based on a tree-like structure where the codes are dependent on
previous elements. Such a hierarchical structure is needed, I think, to
support the TCCB and EPIC algorithms. TCCB is really about a two level
encoding scheme - the top level are the names of headers, and the second
level are their values. They add some optimizations that are SIP specific
(such as sending nothing when it can be assumed that the header hasn't
changed), which I would rather generalize in some efficient way. 

So, the idea is that when you write into the codebook, you provide a bit
which says whether this write takes place at the current "level" in the
hierarchy, or back at the top. Then, you provide a bitstring that represents
the huffman code for the token, followed by the token. It is the
responsibility of the encoder to make sure that each code is a valid prefix
code. When the encoder sends a read command, it contains a bit which
indicates whether the read is from the top of the tree or the current
position, followed by the code. 

So, lets take a simple example. We want to compress something like:

A: foo
B: bar
A: baz

which is a sort-of sip message thing. We will use a TCCB-like approach,
where we encode the headers and values separately. Assume two bits for the
message type (READ or WRITE), and 8 bits per character. We can do better
using a separate codebook for text, as Richard has proposed.

for the first message, we send:

WRITE, top=TRUE, "A:" code="0"      (2 + 1 + 16 + 1 = 20 bits)
WRITE, top=FALSE, "foo" code="01"   (2 + 1 + 24 + 2 = 29 bits)
WRITE, top=TRUE, "B:" code="11"     (2 + 1 + 16 + 2 = 21 bits)
WRITE, top=FALSE, "bar" code="01"   (2 + 1 + 24 + 2 = 29 bits)
READ, top=TRUE, code=0              (2 + 1 + 1 = 4 bits)
WRITE, top=FALSE, "baz" code="11"   (2 + 1 + 24 + 2 = 29 bits)

TOTAL:                                                132 bits = 16.5 Bytes

This is larger than the original (15 bytes), typical for the case where
there is no static or user specific codebook.

This results in a codebook in the compressor/decompressor that looks like:

   0 "A:"      11 "B:"
   |            |
 -----------   01 "bar"
 |         |
01 "foo"   11 "baz"

Now, if the next message is:

A: foo
B: bar
A: blip

Its compressed as:

READ, top=TRUE, code=0            (2 + 1 + 1 = 4 bits)
READ, top=FALSE, code=01          (2 + 1 + 2 = 5 bits)
READ, top=TRUE, code=11           (2 + 1 + 2 = 5 bits)
READ, top=FALSE, code=01          (2 + 1 + 2 = 5 bits)
READ, top=TRUE, code=0            (2 + 1 + 1 = 4 bits)
WRITE, top=FALSE, "blip" code=001  (2 + 1 + 32 + 3 = 38 bits)
 
                                   Total: 61 bits, 7.625 bytes

Now, this is better, achieving slightly better than 2:1 over a very small
piece of data.

An interesting improvement is that I can specify a command which says "READ
code XX, and then read the next N symbols in the tree if the number of
children at each node is 1, in which case you have no choice about the next
symbol anyway". This is useful for trees that are really deep, as opposed to
wide. If you think about it, this covers LZSS, which can be viewed as a
"hierarchical" codebook where each node is a single character, and the tree
is one where each node has only one child, the next character.

Comments? Hopefully this makes some sense...

Failures can happen for all kinds of reasons. Some will be recoverable, some
won't. The idea here is to apply a general recovery mechanism, which
involves sending a re-INVITE to achieve agreement on call state and on the
current SDP in use for the call. If the re-INVITE doesn't generate any
response, a BYE is sent (which may not generate a response either, but at
least lets intermediate proxies and other things know the change in call
state).

Yes, that is a good point. Right now, there is no general place to put it..

Hi,

Wonderful! If we can standardize a decompressor with a hierarchical
dictionary then we can support all of the proposed algorithms
(EPIC, TCCB, Lempel-Ziv etc.).

The overhead of this scheme is pretty low (3 bits per Huffman code),
but I believe we can reduce it even further. Comments inline...

Regards,

Richard P

On the contrary, your proposal is exactly how I hoped Huffman
coding would be introduced!

Yes. In EPIC, the Huffman codes are local to each dictionary item.

EPIC is similar to TCCB, except that we use n levels of encoding
(where n is determined by the BNF description of SIP).

I would propose to take this one step further, and make the Huffman
code indicate not only the location of the dictionary item, but also
the type of token (READ, WRITE etc.). We could do this as follows:

-   Keep all of the existing token types (READ, WRITE, WRITE-REFERENCE)
    but prefix them with a large bit pattern, say "11111111".

-   Reserve the remaining prefix codes ("00000000" to "11111110") for
    the Huffman codes.

-   When a token is sent explicitly, attach a "shorthand" Huffman code
    that can be used to send the token in future.

When we send the Huffman code, it implicitly specifies the token type
(READ, WRITE etc.) as well as the location of the item to be read or
written.

The advantage of this approach is that schemes like EPIC and Lempel-Ziv
only ever send Huffman codes when reading and writing entries in the
dictionary. Once UDPComp has successfully transmitted these Huffman codes
to the decompressor there is no need to send the tokens explicitly any
more. This makes the overhead of UDPComp negligible (in fact, the only
overhead is the reserved bit pattern "11111111" that we used to send
the tokens explicitly in the first place).

Agreed. However we should make this indicator flag part of the Huffman
code as well, so that we don't have to send it explicitly every time.

Note that there is still a 3 bit overhead for each Huffman code,
due to transmitting 2 bits for the token type and 1 bit to
indicate when to go back to the top of the tree. If we make these
part of the Huffman code then we can eliminate even this overhead.

A similar enhancement might be to allow 1 Huffman code to indicate
several consecutive choices of branches on the tree. This is
especially useful when there is a single very likely route through
the tree, as we can specify this route using only a single short
Huffman code.

> Comments? Hopefully this makes some sense...

It made perfect sense to me, which is probably a bad sign...

Hi Jonathan,
It seems to me that the Huffman coding you describe would be much more efficient
than using the tokens which are given in the UDPComp-draft.
However, I don't quite understand how they can be used for Lempel-Ziv
compression. What puzzles me is that the dictionary, from the Lempel-Ziv point
of view, is considered to be a byte array. This means that the same character
can be present in many of the array elements. In the Huffman tree on the other
hand, each character (or string) appears only once, right? But if you want to be
able to read a string from the dictionary using the command ''READ code XX, and
then read the next N symbols in the tree'', this implies that there must be a
possibility for each symbol to appear more than once. But then again, can this
be so in a Huffman tree?
Can someone help me out here? I think I'm missing something.
Regards,
Jan Christoffersson

Please all note the highly relevant remark by Lawrence earlier on in
this thread:

   LWC>> For GERAN at least, the HARD requirement is on the mid-call
   LWC>> Re-Invite sequence, NOT on the call set up. That's probably
   LWC>> true for UTRAN as well, but that's not my area of interest.

At least in the GERAN environment, the real tough cases are
associated with mid-call signalling. This example flow is
clearly not from a mid-call scenario. Also the quoted BW
(starting off with 9.6kbps) does not sound like the mid-call
available bandwidth in GERAN to me - but then I have not been
directly involved in this work, so I may be underestimating
GERAN :-)

   LWC>> I have already sent a posting on my understanding of the
   LWC>> GERAN mid-call problem and the figures that seem to apply
   LWC>> there (and the reasons).

Lawrence, was this a post to rohc or sip list or both?

Thanks,

Romeo

Hi,

I believe the term "tree structure" for the new UDPComp dictionary is
the source of the confusion - it's nothing to do with a "Huffman tree"
per se. In fact, each dictionary item in the tree has its own set of
codes (generated by Huffman or some other algorithm).

The reason for making the dictionary tree-like is so that we can
capture the hierarchical nature of SIP. For example a SIP message can
be divided up into headers, and each header can be further subdivided
into different values. For the "tree-based" dictionary we can change
the Huffman codes we send based on the exact part of the SIP message
we are currently compressing. However we can also support Lempel-Ziv
just by ignoring the tree structure and making the dictionary flat.

Hope this helps!

Richard P

Yes. There is no reason to keep the fixed length tokens in that draft.

No, thats not true. I think things are confused because there are really two
trees here. One is the tree that represents the Huffman code itself (since a
Huffman table can be represented as traversing a tree with bits at each
vertex). THe other is the tree of contexts, which basically tell you which
table is being used. Let me explain.

The Huffman codes effectively encode string values (Richard has proposed
they encode more than that, which I agree with, but thats an orthogonal
issue. Lets keep it simple for explanatory purposes). Each entry in the
table contains an arbitrary string, which is the string to be outputted as
part of the decompressed message. Consider a simple table:

Code     value
---------------------------------------
0          jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com
10         INVITE
111        From:
1100       Via:

Call this "table 1". I can have many such tables, each of which contains a
Huffman code for a series of strings.

The idea is that you start compression/decompression with a "root table".
The output of the Huffman code not only specifies the string to output into
the decompressed message, but also basically specifies a pointer to the
"next table". So, really, if the above table were the root table, it should
really look like:

Code     value                           Next table
----------------------------------------------------
0          jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com          table 2
10         INVITE                           table 3
111        From:                            table 4
1100       Via:                             table 5


Rather than explicitly specifying the next table by a table number, I do it
with a bit. A value of 0 indicates that you use the root table. A value of 1
means you use a table which is unique to the sequence of huffman codes that
have been traversed from the root till now. Thus, determination of which
table to use is effectively modeled as a tree as well:

                                            ........   .......


So, we start at the root (table /). If the code transmitted is 1100, we
output the string "Via:" to the decompressed message, and then use the table
named /1100 (i.e., 1100 is like a subdirectory off the root). Now, lets
assume this table has two entries:

Code      String
----------------
0         SIP/2.0/UDP
1         SIP/2.0/TCP

The next thing sent by the compressor is "use the current table, and read
index 0". This outputs SIP/2.0/UDP to the decompressed message, and sets the
table to /1100/0. The process continues. 

Now, what is interesting is when you have Huffman tables with only one
entry. Consider table /1100/1. Lets say its like this:

Code     String
----------------
00       CRLF CSeq:

So, lets say we started from the root, and the encoder sent 1100, which
resulted in outputing "Via:". Then, it sends a command which means "output
the string at index 1 of the current table. Then, if the next table has only
one entry, output that, and then if the next has one entry, output that, and
so on, until you come to a table with more than one entry". So, the
decompressor reads entry 1 from table /1100, and outputs "SIP/2.0/TCP". The
next table, /1100/1 has only one entry, so that is output as well, resulting
in "CRLF CSeq:" being written into the decompressed message. This is very,
very useful as a primitive, since it totally reduces the overhead to zero.
If you extend this command a little bit, and allow the encoder to say
"output the next N things assuming there is only one entry in each table",
you can implement LZSS at the encoder with this primitive command, without
the decoder even having to know what LZSS stands for, or how it works. You
do need an efficient way to tell the encoder to construct a series of tables
in sequence, though. Doing that is easy as well.


Hope that clarifies.

Right! Note that this is not SIP specific. All protocols generally have a
structure where the previous thing restricts what is coming next. Some of
them have deep hierarchies, some are flat, but the point is, they are all
trees. By defining a general purpose "tree context construction and access"
protocol, we can cover a lot of protocols and a lot of algorithms. I have
argued that this tree structure covers LZW, LZSS, TCCB, and EPIC, which is a
pretty good set of coverage...

Great! I had thought you were proposing that a pre-agreed upon Huffman code
be referenced during startup time, or that it was downloaded at startup
time. The proposal here is that the Huffman codes are constructed as you go,
since you need that to support dynamic codebooks, which I think we all agree
is needed. Of course, one can easily support downloading of the codes at
start time if a primitive is defined which is "WRITE this, but don't output
anything into a decompressed message".

Excellent idea! Our goal should ultimately be that the encoder output is
always a series of huffman codes, with some extra stuff to write the strings
into the codebooks that are not already there. Some more thoughts on that
below.

I agree with that, but I'm not sure that you want to use these large bit
patterns to represent the initial commands. The result will be that initial
WRITEs and READs are really, really large. You only need these large codes
when there are lots of Huffman codes in any particular table. That won't
always be the case at all. 

One way to solve this is to have a really nice way to dynamically construct
the Huffman codes. Lets say you have a Huffman code represented by some
tree. Adding a new string can be done in only one way. You take an existing
vertex somewhere in the tree, and remove the subtree (if present). Add two
new branches below that vertex. Add the subtree to the right branch, and
place your new string to the the other. 

Here's an example Huffman tree. Assume 0 is left, 1 is right:

       
       /\
      /\ A
      B C

THis corresponds to:

00  B
01  C
1   A

Now, we wish to add D. TO do that, we send a command that reads like: "WRITE
into the table, spltting at 00, and the value is D". So, the decoder finds
the vertex 00. TO do this, it starts at the root, goes left, and then left
again. This is the vertex which currently encodes B. It removes B, adds two
branches, places B on the right, and the new element on the left:

    /\
   /\ A
  /\ C      
  D B

Now, this table looks like:

1  A
01 C
001 B
000 D

So, the idea is that we always start with a default table that has two codes
in it, which says "WRITE" in one of the two places:

initial table:

Code       output
-------------------
0          WRITE the string which follows by splitting the indicated vertex
in the curren table
1          WRITE the string which follows into the root table (i.e, change
contexts) by splitting the indicated vertex

This code would need to be followed by the identity of the vertex, and then
the text itself.

This way, you start off with very efficient codes that write into the table.
As the table gets larger, you use the efficient codes for the common
strings, and the code for writing into the table gets longer.

Rather than simply enclosing the text as a string, we should either Huffman
encode that with a standardized table, or else take all of the text in a
message, put them together, compress it as an independent blob, and then
send that together.

Right. My proposal above reduces that as well, since this overhead is not
once per message, but once per new token.

Right, that is the proposal above.

Hmm, interesting idea. You need to be careful about this, though, since
management of this tangle of tables can be complex. It would be really nice
to maintain a simple structure. 

I think the way to do what you are proposing is to define a command which is
"WRITE into the current table, splitting the specified vertex. The element
to write is found by reading from here with the following huffman codes:
XXX, and then the next table is the existing one at the end of the read".

This turns the tree of tables into a more general purpose digraph, which is
probably a really good idea. It can save a lot of overhead in the management
of the table. Protocols, like SIP, have many "paths" through the message
which can arrive at a common piece of data (for example, the SIP URL). This
way, the encoding for the SIP URL appears only once in memory, rather than
based on each path to get to it.

Maybe time to start writing all of this up in an updated I-D for UDPComp,
since its probably hard to get it from these terse emails....

Regular transactions are defined in the terminology section. The definition
provided there is:

Regular Transaction: A regular transaction is any transaction with a method
other than INVITE, ACK,or
CANCEL.


+AD4- 
+AD4- 2.   Section 15.4, 3rd paragraph: +ACI-The To field of CANCEL 
+AD4- requests always

+AD4- mean that the CANCEL request will not have a tag if a previous INVITE

Yes. That is what +ACI-containing the exact same value as the request it is
cancelling+ACI- means.

I don't think anything in the *current* SDP usage is dependent on SDP-bis.
The whole SDP/SIP issue was discussed at IETF, and the following was the
consensus of the meeting:

1. Appendix B of bis will be removed from bis. It will instead become a
standalone draft, done through mmusic.

2. This draft will not be sip specific, but rather define an offer/answer
paradigm with SDP.

3. The draft will only reference rfc2327, not sdp-bis. Thats because SIP-bis
depends on this draft, and if this draft depending on sdp-bis, SIP-bis could
not go to RFC until sdp-bis did. Since sdp-bis is going out as draft
standard, the bar is very high for that and it will likely take a very long
time until an rfc number is assigned (look at how long RTP has taken - YEARS
since it was started, and still not done). The only real issue is the
a=inactive attribute. My easy fix for that is for the offer/answer draft to
reference rfc3108 (ATM SDP) which defines this for the first time.

4. SIP-bis will reference this new draft, explaining how to encapsulate the
offer/answer model into sip messages. 


The result is a nice generalization of a usage of sdp that is appropriate
for other protocols too, and a needed shortening of the sip-bis spec.

So, if anyone objects to this plan, speak now. I will be ripping this
appendix out of bis in about two weeks and resubmitting it as standalone at
that time.

So, here is an important question on the inactive attribute. If a stream is
inactive, is RTCP sent? I think it probably should, actually... RTCP helps
to keep state alive in various places, and this session is still alive, just
suspended.

THoughts?

That has little to do with SIP, and will just happen in the OS since no one
is listening on that port anyway.

My recommendation is this. If a UA is in a call, and begins getting ICMP
errors on a media stream, and wishes to continue with the call, it SHOULD
send a re-INVITE on that leg. 

As an orthogonal issue, if a UAC receives a 481 to a mid-call re-INVITE, it
SHOULD tear down the call by sending a BYE.

For your case, the re-INVITE will trigger a 481 since the call is not known
and not wanted at this server (the Tag indicates its a re-invite), and thus
the call is torn down and the media stops.

Well, as I mentioned above, the call is not likely to be established in the
general case (although it can if recovery is what is desired).

Tag in the To field = re-INVITE. The process is described in section 15.5 of
bis-04 (although it says nothing yet about sending a BYE after getting the
481. Thats the proposal.)

I suspect this is going to start a very large flame war, as nat discussions
always do, but I'll bite, since I think this is important.

Some argue that nats exist because address space is limited. My ISP has
limited space, so they give me only a single address, or charge exhorbitant
rates for extra addresses. So, I buy a nat to allow multiple devices to
exist behind a single address. Indeed, I am behind a nat at home right now.
With v6, address space is so plentiful, that the provider will happily give
me 100 addresses for nothing. So, the need for the nat goes away. Thats the
theory, at least.

I am not convinced that this is really actually true. I fear there will
still even be nats with v6. Here is why:

1. some people deploy nats for privacy reasons. That is, they make it so
that no one can know the actual internal addresses of boxes within my
network. In a typical configuration, nats won't actually provide any extra
protection, since mappings are frequently guessable or static. But, when
done right, it can provide a degree of privacy that is not afforded with a
firewall (generally, it requires randomized, dynamic mapping of internal
addresses into a LARGE external address space, larger than the internal
one!). The large external address space required here is expensive in v4,
but becomes cheaper in v6. Arguably, this usage of nats therefore becomes
more attractive with the deployment of v6!

2. People want addresses, so there is demand. Providers control the supply.
Even though they are plentiful, you still must go to an ISP to get one, and
they'll try and charge you money because of they know you want one. The
large supply will certainly drive the price down, but will virtually
unlimited addresses really be free? Not clear. Free is a hard business model
to sustain, as the last year has taught many of us....

3. v4 to v6 transition requires nats of some sort.

So, I hope they do go away ultimately, but I am not so certain. Because of
their pervasiveness today, and because its not clear they'll go away even
with v6, I am a strong advocate of dealing with them in a reasonable fashion
so that new applications can continue to be built and function, even though
there are lots of nats around. 


OK, flame away.

No, you are correct that this is a problem. I wish I had seen this email
earlier. I discovered this problem as well yesterday when updating the
session timer draft. I forwarded a note to the list with a proposed
solution, which was basically to have the proxy insert a Min-SE header in
this case, instead of rejecting it, and then proxying it on. The UAS chooses
the session timer to be the MAX(Min-SE, Session-Expires) and returns that in
the Session-Expires header in the response. 

I welcome your comments on this mechanism.

I think it is worth discussing this as a separate item. Its come up a few
times and is amongst my open issues list for bis.

We've run into a couple of cases now where a merged request isn't a bad
thing. The current text on merged requests
(http://www.jdrosen.net/sip/multiple_requests.txt) pretty much assumes that
the only thing of relevance for a proxy is the r-uri, so that if this hasn't
changed, the results of the proxy processing won't change. It has become
clear that this is not the case at all. We now have several things that an
upstream proxy might have modified which will result in differing behaviors:

1. Require/Proxy-Require stripping/addition
2. Session-Expires updating
3. modification of caller preferences headers

There are several views on what to do here:

1. proxies shouldn't be mucking with any of these things anyway. The only
real thing a proxy should change is the r-uri, so that the current merging
text is correct. Basically, don't fix this problem.

2. As Brett has suggested, the proxy can redo its processing on these
requests. If the "result" is the same, reject it as described in the text.
Note that figuring out whether the result is the same is not easy. The
previous request may have even been forked, so that this computation is
quite hard. But, it is doable. Maybe the infrequency of this problem makes
that OK.

3. Proxies don't even look for merged requests. A merged request is treated
as a totally new and independent transaction, and thus processed normally.
The result is that a proxy might proxy the same request twice. Hopefully,
each time is with a different set of top via branch params. Ultimately,
these arrive at a UA, which sees the merging. It applies the same response
to all of them (so long as it uses the same tag, this works out ok). 


Comments? My leaning is probably 3 since I think its the easiest.

Suggestions:

1) Deprecate forking -- solves the whole problem. Failing that, your
proposal seems adequate.

2) Allowing a proxy to insert Session-Expires only in the presence of a UA
Supported header would solve the problem, but begs the question of how to
deal with clients that don't support or indicate support. Rather than
allowing low-timer setups (as your idea of not returning 422), this would
preclude use of sessin timer if at least one UA doesn't support it. On the
other hand, I'm not all that convinced we have this nut cracked anyhow.

It strikes me that we could have made this whole mess irrelevant by making
keepalives mandatory from the start and just using fixed (or algorithmic
with a standard algorithm) timers rather than negotiated timers.

I think the first question we need to ask is whether we even want to solve
the problem of overlapping non-INVITE. 

One of the bigger motivating factors was the MESSAGE method. However, simple
has converged upon NOT using MESSAGE for message transport in the session
model. As a result, that need has disappeared.

Are there other burning needs? This is one of those things where there may
not be a need now, but it could be a big issue down the road when someone
comes up with a need.

Notifications for rapid presence changes, like second-granularity geo-loc
updates, might be a need.

A more radical view is that if you want second-granular presence updates,
you are better off setting up the notifications as a "media stream" as we
are doing for IM, and use just SUBSCRIBE as is to set it up....

THoughts? Lets resolve this.

Dean, we did take a consensus at IETF 51 to put this to rest once and for
all. As I recall, the consensus was to NOT deprecate forking, and therefore
we can avoid continuing needless debates on this subject. Since forking will
stay, I will integrate my proposal into the draft.

Right, thats exactly the problem. In this case, the proposal is to insert
Min-SE, so that the UAS effectively does what the UAC cannot - make sure
that the resulting session-expires is not less than Min-SE.

 Rather than

Well, specifically, there would be no session timer unless the client
supports it. That is how session timer worked way, way, way back when, and
there was such a pushback against this, that I caved (I was a proponent of
not worrying about this case) and now we have this complex morass of
negotiation.

Debating what we should have originally done is pointless, and I'm not even
sure I would have put this in bis. I also think that the negotiated timers
will find quite some use, perhaps for things we've been arguing not to use
it for. Caveat emptor...

Folks,

This is the first of a series of emails I am going to send in an attempt to
resolve the open issues in bis. Time is running short, and we need to
resolve these things in the next few months. So, I would strongly encourage
active participants on the list to give priority to these threads, rather
than the many other interesting, but ultimately unimportant ones. I myself
am guilty of being baited all the time with these things....

I will start with those issues discussed at IETF 51. I will send notes for
the ones we both agreed upon, and those we didn't. The agreed upon ones
serve the important purpose of making sure the list itself concurs, since
IETF policy is that decisions cannot get made at meetings, only on the
lists. I suspect there will be no controversy on these.

So, here is the first. Issue #7: CANCEL for non-INVITE.

Issue description: Currently, bis allows for CANCEL for all methods, not
just INVITE. This made sense way back when, before we recognized that all
non-INVITE methods really need to complete immediately. However, if all
INVITEs are supposed to complete right away (i.e., the server immediately
generates a response, and shouldn't wait for user input), the usage of
CANCEL becomes a race condition. Whether the response is cancelled or not
depends on whether or not the CANCEL beats the server's generation of a
response. The argument has been made, and its a good one, that specifying a
mechanism thats ALWAYS a race condition is futile.

What is the cost? Some have argued that its nothing, since its harder to
special case INVITE. However, I suspect there is a real cost on the server
side. It now must have logic that tells it how to undo anything it might
have done for a particular method before sending the final response. Yuck.

The one point of contention at the meeting was whether CANCEL is useful for
stopping timed-out transactions. That is, I send a SUBSCRIBE, and never get
a response. After 16s (or whatever it is), I send CANCEL to terminate it,
because I never got a response. However, I think that this is not a good
argument. Since the server is supposed to respond immediately anway, sending
CANCEL won't help trigger a response, since there is clearly some big error
thats preventing the response from coming anyway. Others argued that errors
can happen for lots of reasons, so perhaps the CANCEL will help.

My proposal was that we should deprecate CANCEL for non-INVITE. The benefit
is not even quantifiable, at best, and the cost seems high. Of course, for
backwards compatibility, a server should not complain if it gets a CANCEL
for a non-invite, just respond 200 OK (or even 405 is OK) and thats it. It
should have responded to the request anyway. 

There was mild consensus on this, but some key participants disagreed.
Please, speak up and lets resolve this.

Hi,

  Why must the UAC send a bye when a 481 is received? I thought that the
  481 implies that the call leg is terminated. Section 15.5 states that
  "A UAC receiving a 481 response for any mid-call request (INVITE or otherwise)
  MUST consider the call terminated."

Thats the problem. I think this text is wrong. It should send a BYE, and
then consider the call terminated as a result.

Why? Well, we have a general rule that a non-2xx response to a re-INVITE
does not mean the call is dead. Only BYE terminates a call. I'd like to keep
that rule, since it provides a single, consistent way for everyone to
say/know whether the call is up or down.

I feel very strongly about this one. Having multiple ways of signaling that
a call is down is very bad, IMHO.

Subject: [Sip] Open Issue #10: Stripping maddr
Sender: sip-admin@ietf.org
Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org
X-Mailman-Version: 1.0
Precedence: bulk
List-Id: Session Initiation Protocol <sip.ietf.org>
X-BeenThere: sip@ietf.org

Issue:

There has been debate in the past about whether a proxy strips a maddr from
the r-uri when it uses that maddr to send the request. IN other words, a
proxy receives a request, invokes a location service, and ends up with an
r-uri that looks like:

sip:user@foo.com;maddr=1.2.3.4

It therefore sends the request to 1.2.3.4:5060. When this is placed in the
request URI, should that maddr be stripped or not? 

Points to consider:

THe current text in Section 16.5 of bis-04 are clear that it should strip
it. The text also results in things working fine even if its not stripped.
However, there was little comment on this text, despite the large amounts of
email that flew around on the issue itself.

Some have argued that maddr should not be stripped, so that middleboxes can
figure out where the request is going from the sip layer itself (of course,
they can figure it out from the destination ip as well). I personally don't
find this one very compelling.

Proposal:

Consensus at the meeting, without much discussion or objection, was that the
current text is fine.

Speak now or forever hold your peace.

Precedence: bulk

Issue:

Can a proxy record-route non-INVITE, mid-call requests, such as INFO?
NOTIFY? 

Points to consider:

Generally, its hard to argue that proxies should be disallowed to
record-route. We want them to be able to record-route anything so that their
operation can be method-independent. The issue is, what does the UA do with
that information? For things in the middle of an INVITEd session, the UA
does nothing. I think bis is clear on that. If one side has lost the state
of the session, a re-INVITE is the only thing that can replace the lost
route set.

The complex issue comes up with "session things" that are not created by
INVITE. The one and only example to date is SUBSCRIBE. Adam has proposed
that a SUBSCRIBE can usefully fork, resulting in the creation of multiple
subscriptions. However, because of non-INVITE response merging rules, the
UAC will learn of only one of these. It learns of the others through NOTIFY.
Proxies can record-route those NOTIFY's, and the result is that the
subscriber will get NOTIFY requests with new call legs (but the same
Call-ID). It can therefore recognize these as creating multiple
"subscription-legs", much like multiple 200 OK create multiple call legs for
INVITE. Now, like any other "leg", we need to establish a route set for it.
The proposal is that for NOTIFY, the UA be allowed to construct a route set
for that subscription-leg, using the Record-Route/Contact in the NOTIFY.

The issue is therefore tightly coupled with forking of non-INVITE. There was
consensus to allow forking of non-invite (message on this is pending), so
the need for this is clear.

In general, new methods which can usefully fork and construct state at
multiple recipients will need a similar 4-way handshake used by SUBSCRIBE.
The four-way handshake is a request-response in the forward direction,
followed by a different request in the reverse direction, one for each
entity that state was created on. For all such requests, construction of
route sets for each "leg" makes sense, so there is definitely a general need
here. 

Proposal:

The proposal is that proxies MAY record-route any method. Whether the UA
uses this to build a route set is method dependent. For bis, the only method
where route sets are built from record-routes is INVITE. Other extensions
which build upon a four-way handshake for some kind of session-establishment
will likely need this, and can specify it on a method-by-method basis. Bis
will discuss the issue in general, and explain why this is so.

There was consensus for this proposal at the meeting. So, speak up now and
object, or forever hold your peace.

Subject: [Sip] Open Issue #20: Mixing unicast/multicast in offer/answer

Issue:

Appendix B is silent on whether its allowed to send an SDP offer with a c
line thats unicast, and answer with multicast. Same with the inverse: can
you answer  a multicast offer with unicast?

Points for discussion:

In general, it is my view that the answer SDP should always be something
that the offerer is guaranteed to be able to use. That is a consequence of
the two way offer/answer handshake. If an offer is unicast, answering
multicast seems a bad thing, since you don't know whether the offerer can do
unicast. The argument is a bit weaker for the inverse case, but there could
be cases where one is being invited to an mbone session that is multicast,
where responding unicast makes little sense.

Furthermore, the semantics of mixed unicast/multicast in offer answer aren't
entirely clear. 

Proposal:

If the offer is unicast, so must be the answer. If the offer is multicast,
the answer should mirror that address (i.e., use the same multicast group).
If you want a particular stream to change from unicast to multicast,
re-invite to update it.

There was consensus on this proposal at IETF 51. Any list objections?

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org
X-Mailman-Version: 1.0
Precedence: bulk
List-Id: Session Initiation Protocol <sip.ietf.org>

Issue:

Currently, bis says that if you use a dynamic PT once, you can't reuse it
again for a different codec in a re-invite. In other words, lets say A
invites B using GSM codec, dynamic PT number 88. Then A re-invites, changing
that stream to use AMR, with PT 97. Now, A re-invites once more. If it wants
to use a codec other than GSM, it cannot use PT 88. Is that a problem?

Points of discussion:

The reason for this is synchronization of the media and signaling. You
absolutely cannot reuse a PT for a different codec until any packets using
that PT have been guaranteed to have exited the network. Rather than worry
about figuring out a number for this, we just disallow reuse. 

The result is that you cannot cycle through more than 127 codecs in one SIP
call. This is a reasonable restriction, IMHO.

Proposal:

keep this restriction.

There was consensus on this at IETF 51.

Subject: [Sip] Open Issue #58: Rejected mid-call SDP in 2xx

Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org
X-Mailman-Version: 1.0
Precedence: bulk
List-Id: Session Initiation Protocol <sip.ietf.org>
X-BeenThere: sip@ietf.org

Issue:

A and B are in a SIP call. A re-invite's B, but includes no SDP in the
INVITE. This triggers B to generate an offer, in the 2xx. A doesn't like the
offer. How does it reject it? When an offer is sent in an INVITE, it is
easily rejected with a 488. But, when the offer is sent in a 2xx, its not
easy to reject. For an initial INVITE, you reject it by ACKing and then
sending BYE. Thats not great, but works OK. For a re-INVITE, you don't want
to BYE, you want to get back to the last-known-good SDP. 

So, the issue is: what to do?

Points of discussion:

One proposal is to ACK the 2xx, disabling all the streams. THen, re-INVITE
with the old SDP, in an attempt to re-instantiate it. However, this
re-INVITE may fail. Also, it results in a transitional period where you have
no media, which is not good.

Another, more outlandish proposal, is to define a NACK that works like ACK,
but says "nah, forget about it". This isn't backwards compatible though.

Dave Oran had suggested that you need something, somewhere, to say "please
go back to where we were before". Whether this is a header in the ACK, or
whether this is in the SDP, it needs to be somewhere. You want to avoid
these transitional periods where the state is bad. You need a way to go
back.

There seemed to be agreement that this was reasonable, but its not clear how
to do it exactly. More discussion is needed.

Issue:

Bis currently specifies that if a client disables a media stream (by setting
its port to zero), it cannot remove that stream from the SDP. As such, a UA
which constantly adds/removes media streams will cause the SDP to
continually grow, and never shrink. You definitely cannot remove them (since
the ordering is needed to match up streams between the offer/answer), but it
can work for a client to re-use a disabled stream. That is, when it wants to
add a new stream, it uses the "placeholder" held by the disabled stream. So,
instead of adding a new m line, the disabled m line is replaced with the m
line of the stream you want to add.

This works because there is never any confusion about which streams
correspond to which. Think of the sequence of m lines in an SDP as a TDM
system, with each stream a "channel". Streams in the offer and answer are
correlated when they sit in the same channel. Once a stream is in a channel,
it can't move to another one, since then you lose correlation. When a stream
is disabled, its channel becomes empty. You can then insert a new stream
into that channel later on, and its clear that this is a new one (because it
replaces a disabled stream).

So, the question is this: do we allow reuse of disabled streams in this
fashion?

Points of discussion:

Why do this at all? The only real reason is savings of bandwidth, since you
can reduce the size of the SDP. This is not a very common case for general
usage. However, the 3gpp guys are thinking about having the proxy disable
streams (egads!) based on some network policy about what codecs to use. They
don't want to be carrying around these zeroed out media streams. However,
our recommended approach with issues like this has been compression (ala the
signaling compression work in rohc). These streams will likely be compressed
very well, so the overhead may be moot.

Gonzalo pointed out that an alternative is to use FID, since that could
provide a way to correlate the streams. In that case, you can remove
disabled streams altogether if they can be correlated. However, it wasn't
clear that FID actually allows for correlation of streams between offer and
answer. Rather, its meant for association of streams within the same SDP.
More investigation was needed.

Proposal:

There was no concrete proposal yet. My leaning is to disallow reuse, and
stick with what we have.

Comments?

Issue:

Do we deprecate forking for INVITE?

Do we deprecate forking for non-INVITE?

Points of discussion:

There was quick discussion on the first issue, followed by a hum of
consensus. THere was strong consensus to keep forking of INVITE, with the
notable exception of the esteemed chair, Mr. Willis. There was agreement to
close on this so that we can stifle continued dsicussion of the subject on
the list.

The second one is more complex. Forking of non-INVITE is complex since the
non-INVITE only generates a single response. Forking makes sense when the
things you fork to are homogeneous and don't create state. Thus, speaking to
any one is fine. If state is created by the non-INVITE, and this state needs
to be managed, the non-INVITE has to have some companion method that allows
the "called party" to send a request back towards the "caller" to indicate
that a "leg" was created there. 

We have encountered a need for this for SUBSCRIBE. It appears to be useful
to fork SUBSCRIBE, and so long as we use Adam's proposed approach of
constructing route sets and leg state through the NOTIFY, it works fine. 

Proposal:

Continue to allow forking of non-INVITE.

There was consensus on this proposal.

Hi,

Support for Huffman codes is clearly beneficial and the detailed
discussion here cleared many confusions in my head. However, I hope 
we still keep simplicity in mind while stretching out for extreme 
compression efficiency. From byte array to list, to tree, to 
graph, each one can cover the previous one but at the price 
of higher complexity. 

Besides increasing compression ratio from the encoding point of
view (which has been dwelt on with much detail in this thread), 
we should also remember other simple mechanisms that boost compression 
ratio even without complicated encoding, such as user-specific
dictionary 
and cross session dictionary. The former puts redundancy in dictionary 
early so that they can be used right away, and the latter allows the 
dictionary (after "hard working" synchronization) to be used for later 
session. These are simple concepts that are orthogonal to encoding 
algorithms. 

Another useful mechanism is the "shared dictionary" (as Jan mentioned
early). This fits especially well to the (approximately) zigzag pattern 
of SIP messages. It incurs some challenge to the dynamic assignment 
of Huffman codes in the tree structured dictionary. But I believe
it is doable.

In short, we should tackle the problem from all angles by combining
capabilities as Jonathan said. As to find "the right sweet spot 
between compression efficiency and flexibility", I would like to 
add simplicity as another dimension.

BR,
Zhigang

The introduction of a=inactive in some sense supercedes the old
c=0.0.0.0 for hold. But the potential for saying c=0.0.0.0 remains,
probably must remain for backward compatibility, and is still useful
even with a=inactive. It is appropriate when you simply don't have an
address to offer, as might often come about in an invite-on-hold
situation.

So, obviously if you say both a=inactive and c=0.0.0.0 then RTCP ought
not (can't) be sent.

If a=inactive and c= a valid address, then perhaps it makes sense to
send RTCP, but I am not sure. There will certainly be cases when it
isn't feasible to send it - a call controller that invites on hold in
anticipation of a reinvite may not have a media implementation available
with which to send to the other end.

I'm not clear about authorization Request Header

from rfc2617
3.2.2 The Authorization Request Header

   The client is expected to retry the request, passing an Authorization
   header line, which is defined according to the framework above,
   utilized as follows.

        1.user and passwd i must recieve from server in the web site
        2.what does it mean "KD"
      =20
???if recieve response from server when register follow this message
if i have user =3D "test1" and password =3D "test2" and request uri =3D =

Hi,

The idea of pre-agreed upon Huffman codes is something we use in
header compression, as part of our framework for writing new
compression algorithms for new protocol stacks. I believe, however,
that downloading the Huffman codes "on the fly" is more appropriate
for SIP compression.

In fact the framework we developed for header compression shares
many ideas with UDPComp, so it might be worth comparing the two schemes
to see how much we can reuse. Streamlining the terminology would be
of particular benefit as it will help us header compression folks
understand UDPComp all the more quickly.

-   UDPComp has a set of tokens (READ, WRITE etc.) for transmitting
    instructions from the compressor to the decompressor. The same
    system is employed in RFC3095, but the tokens are referred to as
    "encoding methods".

-   UDPComp uses a dictionary of indexed fields to store information
    at the compressor and decompressor. This is also done in RFC3095,
    but referred to as the "context".

The job of the compression algorithm is to send enough tokens to
correctly transmit each packet to the decompressor. In RFC3095 the
instructions for which tokens to send at which point are hand-coded
in the standard, which gives a high compression efficiency but is
somewhat inflexible.

In TCP compression (draft-ietf-rohc-tcp-epic-01.txt) we have the idea
of standardising a new compression algorithm as a set of instructions,
each containing an index to a dictionary item, followed by a type of
token (READ, WRITE etc.) and a probability. For example:

  encode Traffic_Class  as STATIC          99.9%
                        or IRREGULAR(6)     0.1%
    
  encode ECT_Flag       as STATIC          99.9%
                        or IRREGULAR(1)     0.1% 
    
  encode CE_Flag        as VALUE(1,0)        99%
                        or VALUE(1,1)         1%

It may not be obvious at a first glance, but each line in the set of
instructions corresponds precisely to the "longhand" form of a UDPComp
token. The token type (STATIC, IRREGULAR, VALUE etc.) is given together
with the dictionary entry that is to be read from or written to (note
that we use names rather than numbers to index the dictionary entries).
The probabilities are converted by the decompressor into a set of
Huffman codes; the compressor need only send the Huffman code to invoke
the corresponding token at the decompressor.

The key difference between this scheme and UDPComp is how the set of
instructions is given to the decompressor. For header compression the
performance of the scheme must be optimal, so the set of instructions
is programmed into the decompressor offline. In UDPComp however, the
idea is to download the instruction set one line at a time whenever
each line is needed. This is very useful for SIP compression because
we can avoid standardising the compression algorithm altogether, and
just leave it as a local implementation decision at the compressor.

Since the two schemes are essentially identical save how the shorthand
Huffman codes are communicated to the decompressor, it would be very
useful to develop them in parallel. The best possible situation would
be for the two schemes to share a common dictionary structure: in this
case we would have a single unified framework for header and signalling
compression! For each protocol we could choose to standardise the
compression algorithm explicitly, or just leave it up to the implementers
to download suitable Huffman codes to the decompressor on the fly.

Streamlining the two documents shouldn't affect the deadline for
standardising UDPComp: in fact it might help speed things along because
we have a decent tree-based dictionary structure worked out already.

More comments included inline.

I believe that we could still have a dynamic dictionary even if we
agree/download the Huffman codes offline. In fact, this is how we
distribute the Huffman codes for header compression. However for SIP
compression it is better to download the Huffman codes as they are
needed, so that we can avoid standardising them in the Internet Draft.

Agreed. Without a local set of Huffman codes we don't get any better

This is a particularly cunning method of sending the Huffman codes to
the decompressor!

I believe that algorithms like EPIC and Lempel-Ziv do this anyway. In
EPIC we send Huffman codes for the longest matching string we can find,
where the string can be 1 character long if we can't find a better
match. So when encapsulated in UDPComp we never send a WRITE token
containing any more than 1 ASCII character. Everything else is done
using READ and WRITE-REFERENCE.

As with all of the other ideas for improving the compression ratio, we
need to weigh the performance gain vs the additional complexity. For
this particular modification the improvement in compression ratio is
just over 30%.

I believe this also improves the compression ratio, because the same
URL can appear several times in a given SIP message. If we use a
digraph then we can avoid sending the URL more than once.

No objection to this resolution.

However I though I would point out that the Offer/Counter-offer/Answer SDP
model suggested in the "Weakness in SIP offer/answer model" thread may be
helpful in solving this problem without a re-invite. 

It falls into the general problem category of:

Caller proposes some media configuration A which is disagreeable to callee,
therefore, callee counter-proposes media configuration B back to caller.
Additionally, the solution must avoid the situation where the caller
believes the call is successfully answered but in fact the caller lacks the
capability to support media configuration B.

[Please reply to original thread to discuss solution details.]

Perhaps defining a SIP header value (valid in 1xx & 2xx INVITE responses)
that simply states that the SDP is a counter offer is the best approach.
This separates the handling of these issues from the early-media issues ?

Content-Disposition seems like a logical place to do this ? For instance
define a new token name to supplement the existing "session" disposition and
use it with a "handling=required" disposition value. 

Comments/thoughts?

In the interests of moving things along, the chairs will call
consensus on these issues explicitly.  If you object, PLEASE
speak up, so that we can try to see if/when objectors are
satisfied.  

Jonathan, poke us if we don't call consensus when you think
we have it, but let us make the call.

Hello,

This attribute is used to put a call on hold. That is, when you put
somebody on hold the stream will be "sendonly". If at that point of time
you are put on hold as well, the media stream will be "inactive".
Therefore, RTCP is still sent.

Yes, bullet number 4 defines perfectly the semantics of the inactive
attribute.

This is currently defined by setting the port number to zero. That is, I
offer you a particular media stream and you set its port to zero in the
200 OK. It means that no RTP and no RTCP will be sent over that media
stream.

This brings me to related topic:

Right now, once you have answer with port=zero, you cannot re-use that
stream during the session. That is, every re-INVITE you send will
contain that media line with the port set to zero, but media will never
flow to it.

It has been brought up (by 3GPP among others) that it might be useful to
be able to re-use that stream in a future. If I want to add a new media
stream to the session, I can use that media line by changing the port
number to a non-zero value in a re-INVITE.

Well, I am triggering a new discussion here (I would like to see
opinions on this), but I believe that the semantics of the inactive
attribute are pretty clear. 

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hi,

There are at least some use cases for that.

For example, group messaging where large number
of clients are sending (sessionless) instant MESSAGES 
to the group address in a server which generates new 
MESSAGEs to all group members. 
It makes no sense to wait until previous MESSAGE has been
acknowledged since it takes too long. So, there will be 
overlapping MESSAGEs.

The actual application may be e.g. instant message group,
game or whatever sessionless application.

In some applications (like games) it would be really useful
to have the ordering (sequencing) information of the MESSAGEs.
For more description and reasoning see
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-koskelainen-sip-group-00.txt

This feature would be enabled by a new header (set by the group server
in the example above). 

In a similar application, this feature would be useful also
between two endpoints.

I think the first question we need to ask is whether we even want to solve
the problem of overlapping non-INVITE. 

One of the bigger motivating factors was the MESSAGE method. However, simple
has converged upon NOT using MESSAGE for message transport in the session
model. As a result, that need has disappeared.

Are there other burning needs? This is one of those things where there may
not be a need now, but it could be a big issue down the road when someone
comes up with a need.

Notifications for rapid presence changes, like second-granularity geo-loc
updates, might be a need.

A more radical view is that if you want second-granular presence updates,
you are better off setting up the notifications as a "media stream" as we
are doing for IM, and use just SUBSCRIBE as is to set it up....

THoughts? Lets resolve this.

Jonathan:

If we have as a operating assumption (requirement?) that non-INVITE methods
have to be responded to immediately, then deprectaing CANCEL for these
methods is actually preferable.

Even in the SUBSCRIBE case you mentioned in your email, if the UAS fielding
the SUBSCRIBE "knows" that there maybe delay -- caused by ldap lookups,
user authorization, whatever -- in responding with a 200 OK to the 
SUBSCRIBE, it still must send a 202 Accepted final response right away.  So 
I see little utility in attempting to CANCEL a SUBSCRIBE.

As I pointed out at the London IETF, this issue is somewhat related to 
Issue #138 (to fork or not to fork [non-INVITE requests]).  Since the 
consensus on Issue 138 is that it is okay to fork non-INVITEs, -04bis 
should indicate (in Section 17.4, handling of 2xx responses) that a forking 
proxy need not CANCEL non-INVITE branches on getting a 200 OK for a 
non-INVITE request.

Adding a NACK will break backwards compatibility, so that rules it out.
Adding a new header, while better than adding NACK, still means more code
to add and one more header to keep track of.

I like the first approach -- ACK the 2xx, disabling all media streams.  The
disadvantage it has over the new header option is that more signaling is
needed in the form of a re-INVITE.  However, I do not understand your 
concern on the re-INVITE failing?  If the session was established 
successfully, and a subsequent attempt to renegotiate it failed, why will 
the re-INVITE fail if the same SDP as the successful session was being used 
in the re-INVITE?

I think you're confusing overlapping, in this example the resolution of
the overlapping messages is a service in the server. i.e. the server
recieves a message from A and sends it to all the recipients, all apart
from B acknowledge, C then sends a message, the server sends it to every
one apart from B, A sends another message, which again goes out to every
one except B, when B acknowledges the first message, he gets sent the
second message etc.

If I was writting a game, I am not sure reliability and any ordering

I'd vote no, the only cases I can think of where it would be needed, SIP
is inappropriate or it's a service issue.

I agree. I thought the consensus at Minneapolis was that sub/not wasn't
a suitable mechanism for rapid updates, something like an RTP payload
was more appropriate.

The idea of identifying m= streams using an explicit id rather than
position in the session description is very old. It seems much better
but is obviously backwards incompatible. Reusing disabled streams seems
more likely to be work with existing clients and so (still) appears to
be preferable.

While an *average* rate of > 1/RTT probably calls for a real transport
protocol, it would be really nice to be able to send an occasional
message with a shorter spacing, particularly given the loss case (i.e.,
where it could be seconds before the answer comes back, thus delaying
the second message). Thus, I agree with Jonathan, that dumping this
feature could get us into trouble later. The increase in protocol
complexity seems close to zero and the increase in implementation
complexity modest.

Limit CANCEL for INVITE only.  Trying to handle CANCELs
for all/arbitrary methods otherwise is going to be prohibitively
complex task -- it will end up as a bunch of special
cases -- i.e. if CANCEL is allowed for all methods,
how do you treat a CANCEL for a CANCEL?  A CANCEL for
a BYE?  A CANCEL for an ACK?  That's ridiculous --
you automatically end up with more special cases for
handling CANCEL to handle CANCELs for methods where
CANCEL makes no sense.

It's a case of confusing an application specific
signal (trying to stop a service/application started
by another method) with a generic procotol level
signal (CANCEL).  Since only INVITE and BYE can
start/change/stop a call, every other method almost
has to be an application or service specific 
invocation, rather than session affecting -- if
this assumption is made, then CANCEL, as a session
level signal, is not apropriate for halting a
service.

My inclination is to allow reuse, but I don't think it can
be done.  Particularly given the restriction on dynamic PT
reuse in issue #23.  Since the INVITE with SDP is used for
recovery, reusing/rewriting an old media stream slot in the
SDP might erase/hide information about the previous state
of the call (which dynamic PTs have been used, plus any
endpoint, media, or application specific information 
associated with the closed media stream) though I am unaware
of any application which is doing this today.  Unfortunately,
since the INVITE/200 + SDP is used for call recovery, 
that reuse will have to be avoided in order to maintain
a full history/state of the call in case recovery is
necessary.

Mmm.  I would probably say it needs to be in the SDP,
probably as an attribute.  The attribute should indicate
what the desire behavior is in failure cases, perhaps on
a per media stream basis.  The behavior could be to fall
back to the previous state, to go on hold pending further
renegotiation, or to hang up/send a BYE if the stream 
cannot be established.  (The last might be useful only
in a handful of cases.)

Having it on a per media stream would allow for
re-INVITEs where the audio stream was marked to
fall-back if there was a problem with negotiating
the audio stream, but for the video stream to 
go on hold if there was a problem with the video
stream.  

Being able to indicate to go on hold rather than
falling back to the previous media stream state
might be important in cases where the media
stream is going down/changing immediately due 
to outside reasons, and that trying to re-establish
an RTCP stream to the prior state could result
in a network unreachable condition -- some 
endpoints might interpret that as an indication
to hang up the call.  If the call should be
hung up if the new SDP cannot be accepted
and because the old one is already known to
be no longer useable, then that could be indicated
by the explicit "Send BYE" as opposed to the
"fall back" or "go on hold."

How can it happen that B provides an offer that is not acceptable to A
provided the UA complies with the first paragraph of B.4 in bis-04?  If
B does want to change, it should issue the re-INVITE.  A can reject this
media with a 488 and the session remains as it was.  Am I missing
something here?  (I'll admit, I don't know of a scenario off hand where
a UA would re-INVITE without SDP to see what the other side will respond
with.)

regards,
Bert

What special check?

if (cancel.method != INVITE) do_error_respose();

You would have to make checks in any case to validate
the CANCEL from an authentication/authorization level,
to see if the method the CANCEL was referring to actually
existed, etc.  There already have to be places in the
message processing where a CANCEL can be rejected due
to various reasons.

Or, inversely, if CANCEL is allowed for non-INVITEs,
then you have to make a special check to see if the
original method was an INVITE, to send back the 487
until receiving an ACK, etc.

This sounds great.  In addition, a recommedation for the case where a UA
begins getting ICMP errors and does not wish to continue the call should
also be noted.  Sending a BYE in this case as well seems consistent with
your position below.  If there is no objection, can we get modified language
in the bis indicating these behaviors?

Thats the problem. I think this text is wrong. It should send a BYE, and
then consider the call terminated as a result.

Why? Well, we have a general rule that a non-2xx response to a re-INVITE
does not mean the call is dead. Only BYE terminates a call. I'd like to keep
that rule, since it provides a single, consistent way for everyone to
say/know whether the call is up or down.

I feel very strongly about this one. Having multiple ways of signaling that
a call is down is very bad, IMHO.

Hello,

	In the draft, titled - 'SIP Call Control - Transfer
draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-05' there is a reference to another draft for
'The REFER Method' (reference number 3). 

[3] Sparks, R., "The REFER Method", draft-ietf-sip-refer-00 (work in
progress), July 2001. 

	I could not locate this draft in the IETF web page. Can anyone
please email me a link to this draft.

Thanks,

Chinmay

Hello,

	In section 6.4.2 in the caller preferences draft,
draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-04.txt the third paragraph mentions - 'A contact
entry may contain a priority member'. But the 'Priority' header is allowed
only in the INVITE message (per table 5 in bis 04). So how will a registrar
get a contact entry with a priority member?

	Should table 5 in bis 04 be updated to allow Priority member field
for REGISTER? Or am I missing something?

Regards,

Chinmay

This argument would be true if the cost of the CANCEL for non-INVITE was
otherwise nil. But, thats not true. What happens if the CANCEL actually
beats the server to sending the final response? Now, you have to actually
cancel it. How does one CANCEL a SUBSCRIBE? A NOTIFY? An OPTIONS? Each
method would need special code. 

Furthermore, since its usage is always a race condition, an entity that
sends CANCEL would always need to handle the case where the cancel works and
doesn't work. Thus, its extra work to do this.


Note that I have stipulted that for backwards compatibility, if you get a
CANCEL for non-INVITE, you still respond to it, but otherwise do nothing. In
that sense, its "allowed", but we explicitly define it as a no-op.

Yes, thats fine. But, I want the text to be clear that this is only if you
really have some other reason for not continuing. A triggered re-INVITE on
ICMP errors does wonders for reconstituting state and providing fault
tolerance. Most of the times, that is what you want.

Fine by me. Speak up folks, or the text is going in....

Well, this is a little bit different. Port zero means "tear down this
stream". This would result, for example, in the closure of any windows that
were popped up for video rendering of the stream. I think Sean's case is
where we neither send RTP/RTCP, but the stream is only temporarily suspended
and can be revived. A better question, is whether we really need this
additional case. I'd rather limit them to things we really need.

Hmm, I though I had sent out an email on this open issue as well.... I'll
resend if I don't see it in the archives.

Hi,

I think it would be a good idea to bring this question to the Megaco
mailing list. There are lots of people working on Media Gateways there,
so maybe they have some kind of solution for this.

I can write down a few lines, and also CC the mail to the SIP list
(since I guess most of us aren't on the Megaco list...).

Regards,

Hi,

There is a discussion on the SIP mailing list about call holding, and
the possible use of the "inactive" mode.

The question is: does inactive only put the RTP stream on hold, or both
the RTP and the RTCP? And, is there any way to define if you want to put
only the RTP, or both the RTP and the RTCP, streams on hold?

Certainly something I never thought about.  I should point out that inactive
mode is typically used at the start of a Megaco call flow, to prevent
cut-through of the caller before charging has begun.  If RTCP is running
anyway, we have to think about any possibilities for fraud.

The offer/counter-offer/answer model also appears in the manyfolks draft.
The specific case where it is essential is when the UAS reduces the
preconditions requested by the UAC - the UAC needs a mechanism to
drop a media stream from the session if the UAS will not agree to
all of the preconditions for it.  So an SDP is included in the PRACK
in this case.

There are at least two other situations where the offer/counter-offer/
answer model is a big improvement.

If the UAC and UAS both support a large number of codecs, but with very
few in common, it may take a while to find one in common.  If the UAC
sends an initial SDP with a single codec, which is not supported by UAS,
the session would fail and the UAC would have to re-try with a different
codec.  This is true even if the UAS responds with an alternative in
its answer SDP.  The three-way handshake allows the UAC to insert _all_
of its supported codecs in the initial SDP, the UAS to indicate those
it supports as well, and the UAC to then pick one of the common ones.
Single round-trip codec negotiation, and minimal impact on post-dial-delay.

The second situation relates to billing (that awful B-word).  If the
originating client will be paying for the session, he/she should have
some control over the choice of codec out of the common pool.  While it
is certainly possible for a nasty UAS to thwart this (i.e. for a
telemarketer call, I only support the $$$$/sec media streams), the
final choice of media streams properly belongs to the UAC.

I perceive a strong weakness in the current SIP offer/answer model.

The problem pertains to the fact that the callee has no way of indicating
its media profile requirements. Consider the situation: 

A sends INVITE B with
m=audio 5454 RTP/AVP 0
m=video 4444 RTP/AVP 31

However the server only supports (or requires for this call) a different
profile, eg RTP/SAVP or some other transport profile (RTP/AVP-USCTP or TLS
or something). 

There is no way that the callee has to communicate this information to the
caller. This will be needed for proper deployment of SRTP on servers and a
great many other things.

- You cannot accept the call by setting the port to zero and then sending a
re-INVITE as you cannot be sure that the client supports this profile.
Answering calls successfully when you really don't have the ability to
communicate is something that we want to avoid at all costs (dead handset
syndrome). 

- It cannot be communicated in SIP headers as this is a layer violation (and
just bad design). You are trying to use the session protocol to signal he
required SDP transport paths.

- You could send a 4xx error with an SDP indicate the appropriate offer that
the caller should make to be successful. The requires more messages, longer
call setup times and new parsing & analysis logic of the SDP on the client
side. I don't like it.

I have a proposal: I think what we need is to allow a
offer/counter-offer/answer model. Now this sounds very familiar ->
Jonathan's new Early Media model! SDP in INVITE, callee instead sends
counter-offer in reliable provisional response, to which the caller either
accepts or rejects with the SDP in PRACK. When the 200 OK is eventually sent
by the callee it is in answer to the SDP in the PRACK (rather than original
INVITE).

I would like to see this generalized such that it can also be used with
local ringback (rather than removed as some have requested). 

Once again, I see this functionality as _absolutely_ crucial to the proper
deployment of SRTP and other SDP transport profiles. This also apples to the
situation where the callee needs to know whether the caller supports a
certain SDP capability (for instance, support for a particular SDP
attributes) - another very, very important case.

Please suggest something else if you don't like this scheme. 

[Jonathan proposed an alternate solution in the open issues section of his
early media draft:

	  .... We would then need a token in the 1xx somewhere
        which says "I ignored your offer of SDP in the INVITE, this
        2xx is an offer, not an answer". This token, perhaps a
        require token, would be present in the original 1xx but not
        1xx in response to re-INVITEs. We could apply this to
        INVITE/2xx/ACK as well.

We should try to make any scheme consistent and as long as it works I am not
bothered.]

Regards,

Robert.

Yes, I agree that we do not want to resolve theoretical problems. We
have enough "real" problems to work on.

Anyway, if we do not want to *receive* neither RTP nor RCTP we set
c=0.0.0.0
If we do not want to *send* RTP we mark the stream as recvonly or
inactive.
We only have to figure out how to signal the fact that we will not
*send* RCTP.

If, as Jonathan suggested, somebody needs this capability (he or she
should speak up) we can work on it.

Gonzalo

OK, seems like consensus on this one.

Yes, that is true. 

I will take this to mean consensus on this issue as well. I'll update the
draft today and get it resubmitted with these changes. I think we are
finally done!

Hi,

I have the following questions regarding encryption of SIP messages and
I hope someone could help.

1. In rfc2543bis03, there are examples for using PGP for end-to-end
encryption. Is there any other encryption scheme defined? One thing
which confused me is that PGP is a collection of many schemes. So, for
instance, if DES is to be used, are we supposed to use DES within PGP?
Is it possible to specify the use of DES without PGP? 

2. In section 18.1.4 of rfc2543bis03 about Hop-by-hop encryption, IPSec
and TLS are mentioned. Does it imply that hop-by-hop encryption will not
be performed in the applicaiton layer (encrypting the whole SIP
message)? 

Thank you very much in advance. Any comments and related discussions are
welcome.

Just to clarify, instead of DES, the example I should have used is CAST,
Triple-DES, or IDEA, which PGP supports.
Are we supposed to use them within PGP? or is it possible to specify
their use without PGP?

I am sorry if these issues have been discussed before. I have two issues
concerning carrier grade SIP applications.

(1) When using a stream based transport protocol, e.g., TCP, SIP poses
several problems because SIP messages don't carry total length in a fixed
position, e.g., the first 4 bytes of the messages:

(a) Although the messages can be parsed in normal conditions, our tests
showed that the performance of using current SIP spec is several times
slower than carrying a total length in front of SIP messages.

(b) There is no robust way to handle malformed messages coming from TCP
without a total length in a fixed position. For example, a message doesn't
have a correct end of message headers.

So what is the reason that SIP doesn't specify a total message length in a
fixed position. I propose to carry a total length of each message in the
first 4 bytes for stream-based transport protocol.

(2) The Record-Route header has been overloaded to be used by subsequent
requests in both directions. This causes problems when one side of proxy
uses TCP and the other side uses UDP, although bis-4 does allow Record-Route
header to carry "transport=value" parameter. Some people have suggested to
rewrite the Record-Route header for final responses. This suggestion posts
performance overhead for all final responses. I propose to use different
names when specify transport protocol parameters, e.g., transport_in =
TCP;transport_out=UDP.

Thank you in advance for your comments and suggestions.

Hi William,

Good comments.

One nit thought, I think we should avoid using the term  "three-way
handshake" with respect to offer/counter-offer/answer. These words have
certain connotations that may confuse people. Although _notionally_ it may
in some way form a three way handshake (because the counter-offer may be
formed based on the original offer), algorithmically the
offer/counter-offer/answer is still a simple two-way handshake. The offer is
completely replaced by the counter-offer. A three way handshake could also
suggest that some confirmation of the answer is made by the receiver which
is also not algorithmically true at the SDP layer.

Not completely wrong but confusing I think.

Regards,

Robert.

Hi William,

I just reread your post and came to the conclusion that we fell into the
confusion I was talking about. It appears to me you _are_ talking about a
true three-way handshake which is quite different to the
offer/counter-offer/answer .... more like a offer/answer/refined-answer.
This is a different discussion and needs to be separated. I might add that
it has been previously proposed and rejected on the list.

In the offer/counter-offer/answer model we are maintaining the _exact_
semantics of the basic SIP two-way offer/answer model described in bis. The
offer and counter-offer are not algorithmically related at all - in fact
this is where the real usefulness of the model is achieved. [Eg Caller
offers RTP/AVP, callee counter-offers RTP/SAVP; or caller offers one
bidirectional unicast stream, callee counter offers one unidirectional
multicast stream and one-unidirectional unicast stream]

If caller and callee have non-overlapping requirements/capabilities then you
do not want to establish the session initially. Codec refinement can occur
using re-INVITE but you want to ensure that the two UA's can communicate in
_some_ manner before establishment. 

I hope this clarifies things.

Hi,

I am not sure I like the use of c=0.0.0.0 for putting RTCP on "hold",
for the same reason I don't like it for putting RTP on hold: when people
start sending RTP/RTCP using IPv6 we have to define a new mechanism
anyway...

So, I think we should define a long-term solution, which is not
dependent on the IP version - or whatever protocol/network we use. One
though could be to define the RTCP as a separate stream. But then I
guess the problem is to "map" the RTCP to RTP, especially in an
multistream environment.

Regards,

I read document in RFC 1321 .
 But i have some ploblem i don't understand in
=20
request-digest  =3D<"> < KD ( H(A1), unq(nonce-value) ":" H(A2) ) ><">


request-digest  =3D "KD(H(A1),unq(nonce-value) ":" H(A2) )"

A1 =3D unq(username-value) ":" unq(realm-value) ":" passwd
A2 =3D Method ":" digest-uri-value

what KD?,H?

if i have
user : "Mufasa"
realm : "myhost@testrealm.com"
passwd : "Circle Of Life"
nonce=3D"dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093"
=20

I understand that

A1 =3D Mufasa:myhost@testrealm.com:Circle Of Life
A2 =3D GET:/dir/index.html
request-digest  =3D"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1"
=20
H(A1) =3D MD5(A1) --->=3D "a7a51364a1de242a70b8845e528a7cc1"
H(A2) =3D MD5(A2)--->=3D  "39aff3a2bab6126f332b942af96d3366"
 =20
so KD ( H(A1), unq(nonce-value) ":" H(A2)) =20
I think concat H(A1),unq(nonce-value) :H(A2)

a7a51364a1de242a70b8845e528a7cc1,dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093:39aff=
3a2bab6126f332b942af96d3366

and then KD(H(A1), unq(nonce-value) ":" H(A2)) =3D MD5(H

(A1), unq(nonce-value) ":" H(A2))
=20
So =
MD5(a7a51364a1de242a70b8845e528a7cc1,dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093:3=
9aff3a2bab6126f332b942af96d3366)
    =3D d6f5a12596316a226554a4ce76d99026 but not correct
=20

=20
if you have suggestion for me again will thanks a lot

Well, I agree with you whole-heartedly, but you won't be able to get
this idea to fly with the current spec because it breaks too much.

If you mean four bytes of binary data for length, then it 
breaks the readable text only idea people have.  (i.e. 0x00 00 01 00 
for 256 bytes.)

To quote from the spec (bis-04, 10.18):
        The ability to omit Content-Length simplifies the creation
        of cgi-like scripts that dynamically generate responses.

That is for UDP datagrams.  Unfortunately, if you try to nail down
a fixed content length location at the beginning of the message
for TCP, you'll probably break the above for UDP.  So, everyone
must endure so that some can write simple scripts that don't have
to worry about content length.  :-)

Following are my comments from reviewing draft-campbell-sip-e164-00.

Bill Marshall
wtm@research.att.com



NITS:

1) draft has expired, and may disappear at any time from the IETF
internet-draft directory.  It should be re-submitted to keep current.

2) draft is included in the sipt charter item of SIPPING.  The
draft name should be changed to draft-ietf-sipping-e164-00.txt

3) draft name in page header is incorrect, and includes several
non-printable characters.

4) date in page header differs from date on first page of draft.
They should be consistent.

5) should not include a reference in the abstract.  Recommend
dropping tail end of sentence ", as specified in [1]"

6) Two of the references ([1] and [3]) are to internet-drafts.
Ref [1] should be to RFC2916, and Ref [3] should be to RFC2915.

7) The full copyright statement is missing from the end.

SUBSTANTIVE:

1) document describes more than handling of E.164 numbers at a
user agent.  It also includes handling at proxies and at PSTN
gateways.  The introduction and abstract should be updated to
includes these.

2) definite lack of spec language in the draft.  While the abstract
and introduction claim the document describes how a UA will use DNS
to resolve E.164 urls, the only MUSTs are that the UA and proxy MUST
NOT use "e164.arpa" for locally-scoped telephone numbers.

Consider the following paragraph as a suggestion:

The UA MAY send the request to a pre-configured proxy.  Otherwise,
the UA MUST perform a lookup/translation function on the destination
URL.  If a tel: URL, the UA MUST consult an ENUM database, as 
described in [1], and convert it to a sip: URL.  If a sip: URL (or
after conversion of the tel: URL via ENUM), the UA MUST examine
the hostname - if different from the UA the UA MUST consult DNS
and forward the request to that host.  If the hostname matches the
UA and the tag "user=phone" is attached to the URL, the UA MUST 
consult an ENUM database as described earlier for a tel: URL.

3) the draft allows a UA to send the request to a pre-configured
proxy, rather than doing the DNS lookup in ENUM.  The same should
be allowed for a proxy - that it can send the request to a pre-
configured proxy that has the ENUM interface.  Otherwise, the
draft is requiring all proxies to implement the interface to ENUM,
which seems more than needed.

In the suggested spec paragraph above, just change UA to proxy and
include in the proxy procedures.

4) The indented paragraph starting "It is tempting to say that the
tel URL and sip URL in the example..." should be moved to closely 
follow the example (not in the section after the example).  Suggest
putting it after the paragraph "Both example describe..."

5) Open Issues section should be dropped.  RFC2916 is included
by reference, and no need to duplicate its text in the current
document.


Questions for the SIP WG:

1) First paragraph in "User Agent Client" indicates a tel: URL may 
appear in a Contact header.  I don't think this is valid.  Is it?

I've submitted refer-00 to the internet-draft
repository. While the submission is being processed,
the draft is available at
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-00.txt

This is the draft as of the _beginning_ of August's meeting,
and does not yet reflect the directions we've agreed to since.
(in particular, removing the signature from the referred-by line
 in favor of a generic header protection mechanism).

I should have those out in refer-01 shortly.

SIP-T is a working group item of the soon-to-be SIPPING WG
(www.softarmor.com/sipping)- the SIP WG is now focusing on core protocol
rather than applications of SIP, and hence it is no longer looking at SIP-T.
Future correspondence about SIP-T should be directed to the SIPPING mailing
list (sipping@ietf.org).

That much said, the status of some of the work items (ones I happen to be
involved with) is as follows:

draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-10: Complete. Should be issued its RFC number any
day now.
draft-ietf-sip-isup-02: Version -03 is complete and will come out of the I-D
queue in a few days now. Nits/WG last call are forthcoming.
draft-vemuri-sip-t-context-02: Renamed to 'draft-ietf-sipping-sipt-00', will
come out soon. Past nits review, WGLC will follow shortly.
draft-ietf-sip-isup-overlap-01: Just came out. Incorporates 490 status code
(i.e. re-INVITE before 200 as per the early media draft) and a few other
fixes.

I also understand that Alan's call-flows-05 draft is undergoing WGLC in
SIPPING at the moment.

Yep. In fact, if you consider things like NAT traversal, you probably
want to also send a modicum of RTP packets for sessions that are on
hold. Maybe some comfort noise, at a low bit rate. Otherwise, you are
going to loose your mappings, and the "going off hold" will be tricky.

That's actually a question better asked in 3GPP SA2. They have a slew of
interfaces, each with a symbolic name like "The Sh interface".  There's also
some debate between various 3GPP groups as to which interfaces exist and
what to call them, for example "SIP+" and "ISC" interface(s).

In general, SIP is used between UE and P-CSCF, P-CSCF and P-CSCF,  P-CSCF
and I-CSCF, I-CSCF and S-CSCF, S-CSCF and AS, and AS-AS, and of course the
inverses of those. There's some debate about whether AS may also directly
interface to other SIP nodes withot using S-CSCF and I-CSCF, or may go
directly to I-CSCF or other firewall proxy without transiting S-CSCF. Mine
can -- why pay extra for more S-CSCF than one really needs? But it's
configurable so that people who really want to spend more money can do so .
. . Free enterprise loves Darwin's dead-end branches if they're well-funded.
There's also another edge-proxy node called a THIG that may appear in
various locations and speaks SIP.

This is not a nice thing. I believe the current plan is to represent
going on hold changing SDP to a:sendonly or a:inactive. If you send me
SDP that says a:sendonly, then I am obligated to respond a:recvonly.
Once I have declared myself recvonly, do you really want me to send
on the RTP port? 

That is certainly an interesting interpretation of "recvonly".
I realize there are some important pragmatics going on here, but
it is really doing violence to the terminology.

I think INFO is an example where such sequencing is required. It would be good to have a generic mechanism for providing ordering.

While an *average* rate of > 1/RTT probably calls for a real transport
protocol, it would be really nice to be able to send an occasional
message with a shorter spacing, particularly given the loss case (i.e.,
where it could be seconds before the answer comes back, thus delaying
the second message). Thus, I agree with Jonathan, that dumping this
feature could get us into trouble later. The increase in protocol
complexity seems close to zero and the increase in implementation
complexity modest.

Hi,

My question is: do we really care? To my understanding, the only thing
that SIP is concerned about is to put the actual MEDIA on hold - period.
The need, or no-need, of RTCP may then be depending on the network
architecture etc, and it's a bearer level issue, so it could be
configurable elsewhere.

We should remember that even if we put media on hold, we still have a
stream, and depending on the bearer network (IP, ATM,...) there may be
some "stream signalling" (RTCP, for example). So, if one really wants to
make sure that nothing is sent he/she may simply remove the stream
completely...

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Can anyone say why it is possible to use Proxy Authentication with ACK? 
(rfc2543 page 41 table 5 or draft rfc2543-bis04 page 40 table 5 , 
mentioned as optional).

We are trying to use Columbia University's sipd 1.18 with Cisco 7960 
SIP-phones. After enabling Digest Authentication speech goes only from 
caller to callee because our sipd sends "407 Proxy Authentication 
Required" after receiving ACK and Cisco's SIP-phones doesn't support 
that. And they seems not to be willing fix it unless there are any good 
reason.

As they said:
"From a more practical point of view, at that poinnt the remote end's 
phone already ringed and the call has been answered, that means we are 
in CONNECTED and any the billing of the call is started. It makes little 
or no sense at all to worry about authorization when the call is up. On 
the contrary, the 407 should be sent back as answer to the INVITE."

And I can't see any use of that either.

An ACK should never generate a response (section 5.1.1 paragraph 2) so any
further discussion is really meaningless, the sipd is at fault if it
responds to an ACK.

However the tables 4 and 5 should really be changed so that all headers are
marked as  "-" in responses to ACKs. Paragraph 2 of section 5.1.1 perhaps
also ought to be "The ACK request MUST NOT generate responses for any
transport protocol.", just to make it absolutely explicit.

Clearly, its a cost/benefit thing. There is some cost, and there is some
benefit. The relative values of the costs and benefits will be entirely
subjective without some more concrete information.

So, I think a few questions still need to be answered:

1. Who has UA and/or proxy implementations which will be mightily upset at
seeing overlapping non-INVITE transactions within a call leg (in theory,
should be nobody, but I'm curious...) Is the complexity of buffering these
at the sender higher than the complexity of buffering at the receiver to
handle reordering?

2. What are some concrete use cases that people need? Can someone point out
some PSTN cases using INFO where we will legitimately need to send a second
INFO right away? Would performance really be hindered by buffering it?

Good point. Fixed.

Yes, thats right. Fixed. In general, the use of MUST/MAY/SHOULD in many
places needs to be improved.

Well, the text does allow it to change. I suspect people might change the IP
address and port, just to allow differentiation of media sent from the far
side before and after the re-invite. In principal, that should not warrant a
rejection.

It may very well be that the simplest solution to this problem is simply to
change this SHOULD to a MUST; i.e., in a mid-call re-INVITE w/o SDP, the 2xx
MUST contain the "same" SDP as last provided to the peer, with the exception
of being able to change the IP address/port if so desired. 

I'm quite happy to do that, and would propose this as probably the best and
easiest solution. Objections?

(I'll admit, I don't know of a scenario off

Its a classic third party call control scenario, and arises quite
frequently, actually, in order to connect the user to different media
sources during a call.

From Appendix I, it was removed since its never needed. WIth UDP, if not
present, the length is the remainder of the packet. With TCP, its until the
connection is closed. As such, there are no conditions under which its
needed.

I agree, changing media destination should not cause a rejection.  And I
realize SHOULD is currently specified in the text.

I myself would like to see MUST, and agree that changing IP address/port

In these cases (3pcc), as the controller I would recommend a more
"assertive" behavior.  That is, send the desired SDP in the re-INVITE.
Re-INTIVEing with no SDP (without the above restrictions) is asking for
trouble in my opinion.  (Just to be clear, I can see INVITE w/o SDP
being very useful, but not re-INVITE.)

Several times! Yikes! Our performance results show a small decrease in
performance (on the order for 10%), and we suspect that has a lot more to do
with issues surrounding buffer sizing, delayed ACK, etc. Sounds like a
problem with your implementation, rather than a fundamental problem with
length indicators.

The spec talks about how to handle the case where the length is not present.
If its wrong, you end up with an overly long or overly short payload, which
results in an error being generated.

All of this seems to work for HTTP, which supports persistent connections
even, so I have a hard time believing its unworkable for SIP.

Well, this is more of a transport issue. Sounds like what you are asking for
is message oriented connection transport. SCTP provides such a thing.

Sure, but no more than any other response processing thats done in a proxy
(like stripping a via header). Compared to the rest of the overall
transaction processing, I suspect that the overall contribution to
performance for rewriting the RR in a 2xx is tiny, so fixing this is not
likely to do much for you.

I'll also note that it is often necessary to specify a different port and IP
address, so that this would not be sufficient.

In this case, you probably don't even want to implement "on hold" using the
a=sendonly attribute. Rather, you would re-INVITE to switch to a comfort
noise codec, or something like that. Remember, we are not standardizing on
hold, we are standardizing a primitive that might be used to implement on
hold.

Several times! Yikes! Our performance results show a small decrease in
performance (on the order for 10%), and we suspect that has a lot more to do
with issues surrounding buffer sizing, delayed ACK, etc. Sounds like a
problem with your implementation, rather than a fundamental problem with
length indicators.

[Jin-Gen Wang] I don't think this is related to buffer sizing, etc. I do
agree that it's implementation related. I am not convinced it's a small
overhead unless some people can show their results. Even 10% is not trivial.
Again, I am talking about carrier grade software.

If it has been raised several times before, it may indicate there is an
issue. I am not sure how many applications using TCP are there in a high
stress environment. Other people may raise this issue again in the future.

The spec talks about how to handle the case where the length is not present.
If its wrong, you end up with an overly long or overly short payload, which
results in an error being generated.

All of this seems to work for HTTP, which supports persistent connections
even, so I have a hard time believing its unworkable for SIP.

[Jin-Gen Wang] If one message is missing end of headers or has incorrect end
of headers, the next message will be skewed. This is not acceptable for
processing phone calls. I am not sure how many people use HTTP to do phone
calls.

Well, this is more of a transport issue. Sounds like what you are asking for
is message oriented connection transport. SCTP provides such a thing.

[Jin-Gen Wang] After all, SIP is message oriented. It happens that UDP
packets encapsulate messages for you. But for TCP, it's different. I haven't
seen a solid reason NOT to carry the message length in a fixed position. The
protocols I have seen in telecommunications so far carry length in fixed
positions. 

What damage will it cause if we do carry the message length in a fixed
position?

Sure, but no more than any other response processing thats done in a proxy
(like stripping a via header). Compared to the rest of the overall
transaction processing, I suspect that the overall contribution to
performance for rewriting the RR in a 2xx is tiny, so fixing this is not
likely to do much for you.

[Jin-Gen Wang] I think you also need to do this rewriting for other final
responses. But if we can avoid such overhead in a standard way, why not?

 I propose to 
> use different
> names when specify transport protocol parameters, e.g., transport_in =

I'll also note that it is often necessary to specify a different port and IP
address, so that this would not be sufficient.

[Jin-Gen Wang] I agree. I just want to bring up an example because we will
still have a problem in the following scenario:

UAC ---(UDP only) ---> PS1 --- TCP ---> PS2 --- UDP ---> UAS.

Let's say PS2 rewrite Record-Route to use TCP for 2xx coming back from UAS.
Now if PS1 does not record-route, UAC will see TCP as transport protocol to
send BYE over which it cannot honor. I think there are issues regarding the
use of Record-Route header in mixing transport protocol scenarios.

Hi,

Thanks for the advertising Dean :-))I am confident that yours can do many other things as well.

One aspect which was left of this was Cx interface - which is between the S-CSCF and the HSS - the interface is diameter.  More information can be found within TS 23.228 and TS 23.002.  The latest version of these documents can be found 
http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/2001-06/Rel-5/23_Series/

There may be more things that are left out as well.

One warning though - there has been "changes" to this which have not been incorperated until they are approved in September.

That's actually a question better asked in 3GPP SA2. They have a slew of
interfaces, each with a symbolic name like "The Sh interface".  There's also
some debate between various 3GPP groups as to which interfaces exist and
what to call them, for example "SIP+" and "ISC" interface(s).

In general, SIP is used between UE and P-CSCF, P-CSCF and P-CSCF,  P-CSCF
and I-CSCF, I-CSCF and S-CSCF, S-CSCF and AS, and AS-AS, and of course the
inverses of those. There's some debate about whether AS may also directly
interface to other SIP nodes withot using S-CSCF and I-CSCF, or may go
directly to I-CSCF or other firewall proxy without transiting S-CSCF. Mine
can -- why pay extra for more S-CSCF than one really needs? But it's
configurable so that people who really want to spend more money can do so .
. . Free enterprise loves Darwin's dead-end branches if they're well-funded.
There's also another edge-proxy node called a THIG that may appear in
various locations and speaks SIP.

Okay let's see if this old trick can solicit some comment :)

I propose the following text is added to the next RFC2543bis document to
describe the important offer/counter-offer/answer model. The changed text is
marked. [Note no changes are required to Appendix B.]

10.15 Content-Disposition

        Content-Disposition   =  "Content-Disposition" ":"
                                 disposition-type *( ";" disposition-param )
        disposition-type      =  "render" | "session" | "icon" | "alert" |
"newsession"
	
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                             |   disp-extension-token
        disposition-param     =  "handling" "="
                                 ( "optional" | "required" | other-handling
)
                             |   generic-param
        other-handling        =  token
        disp-extension-token  =  token


   The Content-Disposition header field describes how the message body
   or, in the case of multipart messages, a message body part is to be
   interpreted by the UAC or UAS. The SIP header extends the MIME
   Content-Type (RFC 1806 [33]).

   The value "session" indicates that the body part describes a session,
   for either calls or early (pre-call) media. The value "render"
   indicates that the body part should be displayed or otherwise
   rendered to the user. For backward-compatibility, if the Content-
   Disposition header is not missing, bodies of Content-Type
				 ^^^ I don't think the "not" is supposed to
be here
   application/sdp imply the disposition "session", while other content
   types imply "render".

*   The value "newsession" indicates that the message body describes a 
*   session, however, it indicates that this message body is start of a new 
*   session content negotiation. The "newsession" value may only be
*   used in INVITE 200 OK responses (and provisional INVITE responses if 
*   explicitly allowed by extensions) when the original INVITE request
contained a 
*   message body of "session" disposition type. As such, the "newsession"
value
*   means that the message body in the INVITE request is ignored. For 
*   Content-Type application/sdp this means that the 200 OK contains a
*   new SDP offer and that the ACK must contain an SDP answer. There does
not need
*   to be any correlation between the "newsession" message body and the
message
*   body in the original INVITE. The "newsession" value should always be
used with 
*   the "handling=required" disposition parameter. If a UAC is unwilling or 
*   unable to use the "newsession" message body it should simply treat the 
*   message body as invalid.

   The disposition type "icon" indicates that the body part contains an
   image suitable as an iconic representation of the caller or callee.
   The value "alert" indicates that the body part contains information,
   such as an audio clip, that should be rendered instead of ring tone.

   The handling parameter, handling-parm, describes how the UAS should
   react if it receives a message body whose content type or disposition
   type it does not understand. If the parameter has the value
   "optional", the UAS MUST ignore the message body; if it has the value
   "required", the UAS MUST return 415 (Unsupported Media Type).  If the
   handling parameter is missing, the value "required" is to be assumed.

   If this header field is missing, the MIME type determines the default
   content disposition. If there is none, "render" is assumed.
   ^^^^^^ isn't this paragraph repeating what was said in 2nd paragraph

Comments?

Robert.

Hi,

How about using the FID (or something similar) as a stream identifier,
identifying a stream for the whole session (not only within a specific
SDP)? Then it would be very easy to add/remove/change/whatever streams.

For example, assume a case where I set up a session with 5 streams.
Then, later in the session, I want to add one stream and remove one of
the old ones. By using identifiers one does not have to include any
information about the streams that are not affected by the mid-session
change.

Regards,

Hi, I have a question on basic authentication of SIP.

To my understanding, SIP uses the HTTP basic and digest authentication
mechanism.
When using basic authentication, the server will chanllenge client with a
"realm"
parameter to indicate which server is in need of authentication. But the
client
only need to provide encoded form of "username:password" in credential.
Since
a SIP request may pass more than one server before it reaches the
destination
and all servers could require authentication, so a SIP request may contain
more
than one credentials. The result is that a server cannot distinguish which
credential
is corresponding to the chanllenge sent by it.

I do not know whether there is already some ways to solve this problem. For
the time
being, I just let the server to compare all the passwords in all the
credentials with
passwords stored at server. But it is not efficient. My opinion is maybe we
could
add a "realm" parameter in credentials of basic authentication. Although
this will
bring difference between SIP and HTTP basic authentication, I think it is
necessary
if we consider the difference between SIP and HTTP --- a HTTP request will
only pass(reach)
one HTTP server while a SIP request will probably pass more than one SIP
server.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Extensions for NAT Traversal
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, J. Weinberger, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt
	Pages		: 13
	Date		: 28-Aug-01
	
In this draft, we discuss how SIP can traverse existing, non-SIP
aware NATs. Our approach is to make SIP 'NAT friendly' with two minor
extensions. The first allows for responses to UDP requests to go back
to the source port of the request. The second allows a registrar to
use the source IP address and port instead of the Contact in a REGIS-
TER.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

This is a very nice idea but I'm not sure how to make it robust against
misordering or packet loss between the compressor and decompressor.
The compressor will need to continue sending the explicit form of the
token until it receives confirmation that it has arrived at the
decompressor, after which it can switch to the more efficient Huffman
code for the token. Using the above technique, can we make sure that
writing the same Huffman code into the table more than once will not
cause problems?

Once the decompressor arrives at the common piece of data (say the
SIP URL), how should it decide where to go next? Algorithms like EPIC
and TCCB automatically jump back to the dictionary item which
preceded the SIP URL and keep going from there. Alternatively we
could just link the SIP URL to every possible dictionary item that
might follow it. This is simpler but less efficient - the decompressor
"forgets" which part of the SIP message happened to contain the SIP
URL and needs to be sent this information again.

If the length field you are proposing is too long, not present, or too
short, the next message will also be skewed. The failure cases seem
identical.

Total destruction of backwards compatibility with every single TCP enabled
SIP element? Re-invention of message-oriented connection oriented
transports? My question still remains - if you think this is such a problem,
what is wrong with using SCTP which does what you are asking for?

Because it breaks backwards compatibility. Because it is not clear it

This is a well known problem, for which text in -04 already discusses. I
have improved this text further in -05, and the issue has already been
discussed extensively on the list. You cannot RR with a transport param not
equal to UDP unless you are in a private network where you know the
transport capabilities of the hop that RR's on the side you wish to use a
different transport.

Those are our results. Whether you choose to believe me or not is your own
choice.

[Jin-Gen Wang] Again, our tests showed this is the reason. Again, I agree
the percentage of reduction is implementation related. However, even in your
implementation, 10% drop is not trivial.

One disadvantage of the design (no length field in a fixed position) is that
we have to mix message parsing with each TCP connection. This limits the
choice of implementations.

If the length field you are proposing is too long, not present, or too
short, the next message will also be skewed. The failure cases seem
identical. 

[Jin-Gen Wang] I agree. This is the same if the content length in the
current spec is mal-formed. However, when the message length is correct, we
can catch all sorts of mal-formed SIP messages without affecting the next
message, which is much more robust in my opinion. Again, I am talking about
carrier grade software (at least four 9s reliability).

SIP element? Re-invention of message-oriented connection oriented
transports? My question still remains - if you think this is such a problem,
what is wrong with using SCTP which does what you are asking for?

[Jin-Gen Wang] The backward compatibility is a very legitimate concern.
However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't change anything. I am trying to
understand the protocol design idea behind  missing message length in a
fixed position. I haven't seen a solid reason yet.

It seems to me that to force people using SCTP in our case is against "the
transport protocol neutral principal" of using SIP.

Because it breaks backwards compatibility. Because it is not clear it

This is a well known problem, for which text in -04 already discusses. I

[Jin-Gen Wang] Again, it seems to me that this is against "the transport

doesn't that mean the Record-Route idea needs to be looked again?

Just to add a few more interfaces using SIP in 3GPP.
The S-CSCF and BGCF, BGCF and BGCF, BGCF and MGCF, and S-CSCF and MRF.

Hi all,
=20
I have a question for REFER outside of existing call-legs.=20
=20
Consider this:

A sends a REFER to B referring to C. How does B know from the REFER what
kind of session to establish, i.e. audio/IM/etc, and what to include in
the SDP body?=20

Thanks.

The REFER doesn't indicate it.  B decides 
what sort of session it wishes to establish 
with C.  

A similar decision is made for 
INVITE without SDP situations.

Hello,

	I have a question w.r.t Issue 2 mentioned in the email below. 

	Consider the following case -

	UAC ---- P-A ---- P-B ---- P-C ---- UAS

	UAC - Does not support session timer.
	P-A, P-B, P-C and UAS supports session timers.

	P-A has a preferred session timeout of 15 minutes, 
	P-B has a preferred session timeout of 20 minutes and 
	P-C with a preferred session timeout of 25 minutes. 

1.	UA sends an INVITE to P-A. This does not contain any session-expires
header.
2.	P-A inserts a session-expires header - Session-Expires: 900 and
forwards it to P-B.
3.	P-B finds the value too small. But instead of sending a 422 it
inserts a MinSE with a value of 1200. (This is as per the proposed solution
to Issue #2)
4. The INVITE reaches P-C. P-C finds that the MAX(Session-Expires, MinSE) is
less than 1500. 

	My question is what should P-C do? 

a)	Send a 422 - Wont solve the problem.
b)	Add another MinSE. Is this allowed? 

Regards,

Chinmay

OK, seems like consensus on this one.

Yes, that is true. 

I will take this to mean consensus on this issue as well. I'll update the
draft today and get it resubmitted with these changes. I think we are
finally done!

Hi,

Three weeks has past since the last IETF meeting. Is there
any news on the official change of ROHC charter to include 
the work of signaling compression?

The schedule of this work item (from what I heard) is
quite aggressive. To achieve that, should we start to
piece good ideas from different proposals together and 
create a new draft? From there, we can proceed with a 
few cycles to refine it.

Specifically, besides the current discussion on Huffman 
encoding and tree structured dictionary, we should also
consider the following:

1) User specific dictionary (seems every agreed during
the discussion)

2) Maintain dynamic dictionary across session. It is 
reasonable not to throw away the synchronized dictionary.

3) Shared mode. Should help, especially for SIP messages.

4) Make sure the dictionary synchronization is robust
against packet loss/misordering. Complexity may be
affected by dictionary structure.

5) Concurrency issue (re dictionary updates) in shared
mode.

6) Make sure a misordered message can still be decompressed
correctly (related to 4 and 5 but a different issue)

7) Protocol is generic. E.g. if tree structured dictionary
is used, should make sure Lempel-Ziv is still possible and
not penalized. Also, should not depend on SIP-specific
knowledge (although is should work well compressing SIP).

8) Template encoding. Very useful for simple low-end terminals, 
which are probably the majority during the introduction
of SIP to cellular.

9) Anything else?

Above are just some tools we already have and can be used
to tackle the problem. Most of them are simple. It would be 
good if we put them together and then tune the protocol to 
reach a good tradeoff between compression efficiency, 
complexity and flexibility.

Comments?

BR,
Zhigang

It has to also increase the session-expires to 1200.

Same as P-B. Increase Min-SE to 1500 (assuming that you are saying that
P-C's minimum is 1500) and also increase S-E to 1500.

No, but it can increase the existing one. 

I have just submitted an updated version of session timer which incorporates
this new algorithm. It should appear shortly, but in the mean time, you can
pick it up at:

The class of malformed SIP messages which can be caught by your proposal,
but not the current approach, assuming the Content-Length itself is formed
correctly, is only ONE. That one case is where there is no double CRLF after
the last line (unless your parser is really bad, but breaking the protocol
to handle the inability of people to build a good parser is not a good
design choice). I am curious how frequently you are seeing implementations
not include that double CRLF. I have never seen it. Let us please discuss
real problems. 

Perhaps you can point to some real data that says that for HTTP, this
"problem" occurs some reasonable percentage of the time?

Different transports provide different benefits. SIP works with stream and
message transports. You are saying that you like message transports that
provide a lower layer length indication. OK, so use one.

It is a well known problem with documented solutions in bis-04. You
questioned the design decision by proposing a "better" solution that breaks
all backwards compatibility, in the interests of carrier grade. I have
argued that there is no proof that the current design decision cannot work
in carrier grade environments. Just because something requires "processing"
to be done, says nothing about whether eliminating or speeding up that
processing improves overall performance. Amdahls law, remember....

So? 

[Jin-Gen Wang] (1) A good protocol/architecture design should leave the
implementation enough freedom. (2) In general, this is against component
software design to implement SIP. I don't think it's a wise decision.

The class of malformed SIP messages which can be caught by your proposal,
but not the current approach, assuming the Content-Length itself is formed
correctly, is only ONE. That one case is where there is no double CRLF after
the last line (unless your parser is really bad, but breaking the protocol
to handle the inability of people to build a good parser is not a good
design choice). I am curious how frequently you are seeing implementations
not include that double CRLF. I have never seen it. Let us please discuss
real problems. 

Perhaps you can point to some real data that says that for HTTP, this
"problem" occurs some reasonable percentage of the time?

[Jin-Gen Wang] Let's face the reality. The best parser is to parse the
stream once, do you agree? If a start line is mal-formed, e.g., no spaces to
separate different fields. What are you going to do? One option is to read
in all lines and find Content-Length to locate the end of message. Then
re-parse the read-in buffer to indicate the mal-formed start line. This
requires multiple passes through the byte stream.

For one pass parsing, the mal-formed start line should be caught in the
first pass and discard the message. My proposal (actually a common sense
proposal for using stream based transport protocol) will make one pass
parsing work reliably. The current spec requires multiple passes to handle
such mal-formed messages which adds a lot of overhead.  

To deal with such mal-formed SIP messages is a reality for programmers.

Different transports provide different benefits. SIP works with stream and
message transports. You are saying that you like message transports that
provide a lower layer length indication. OK, so use one.

[Jin-Gen Wang] I am not sure what you mean. The message length is on the
application level. I am hoping that the problem can be addressed in a
standard way. Otherwise, people will find their own ways to solve the
problem.

It is a well known problem with documented solutions in bis-04. You
questioned the design decision by proposing a "better" solution that breaks
all backwards compatibility, in the interests of carrier grade. I have
argued that there is no proof that the current design decision cannot work
in carrier grade environments. Just because something requires "processing"
to be done, says nothing about whether eliminating or speeding up that
processing improves overall performance. Amdahls law, remember....

[Jin-Gen Wang] Well, it doesn't work in our environment. I am not in a
position to present our environment. You may say our environment is skewed.
The only thing I know is that the Record-Route is not working well in
mixed-transport protocol scenarios. I didn't say my solution is a better
solution. I just want to see if people have suggestions for fixing the
problem other than those in bis-04 which are not satisfactory.

I thought that this issue was closed per IETF 49 
with a 481 meaning that the call-leg is dead; 
thus no need to send a BYE.

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf49/minutes/minutes-sip-49.htm

I realize that call-stateful proxies might want 
to avoid snooping for a 481.  However based upon 
the captured minutes and the hum at the meeting, 
I assume that many UA's would have to be modified 
to start sending the BYE for dead call-legs.

No matter the decision, hopefully we can close 
this issue permanently this time. :)

No, they are complementary protocols: SIP is the session control protocol,
whereas TRIP is good to exchange routes to the PSTN. Definitely it is possible
to run TRIP across BGCFs and TRIP for gateways between the MGCF and the BGCF.
These are not part of 3GPP Release 5, but certainly it is a possibility to 
explore for future releases. But still you need SIP to route the session.

The proposal sounds good to me.

If the request was not important, just 
quit sending retries for the request and 
mark the delivery status as unknown/who-cares.

If the request was important, the UAC 
would have had to indefinitely continue 
to send the request or an alternative 
query to find out if the CANCEL actually 
worked.  

If the success or cancellation status of 
a request is deemed important enough, 
how about a new DISCARDORNOTIFY method 
to ensure that the request will be 
discarded if received or a notification 
sent if positively acknowledged? :)

Hi All,

We are currently working on an implementation of SIP. There is however
an issue we have not been able to resolve. 
Apparently, the routing of SIP messages by a SIP proxy is done entirely
based on the Request URI if no Route header is present. However, I
always had the impression that the To URI indicated the callee, so
routing should be based on the To URI. This raised a couple of
questions:
1. If routing is done based on the Request URI, what is the function of
the To URI? Do intermediate Proxies look at the To URI?
2. If the Proxy determines the Request URI based on the TO URI, why do
we have to include the Request URI in the message?

If it has been discussed before, I am sorry, then please point me to
some relevant documents. Thanks,
--

I believe the behavior should mirror INVITE. I believe I pointed this out to

12.1 says:

1xx responses to INVITE requests MAY contain session descriptions.
...
2xx responses to INVITE requests contain session descriptions.

at least one vendor is interpreting the lack of MUST in the second
sentence to mean that since the sdp already was in 180 ringing, they
don't need to repeat it in 200 ok. that interpretation, however, is not
liked by some other sip phones.

the former interpretation may be correct, since according to
ietf rules, only MUST means must.

No, they are complementary protocols: SIP is the session control protocol,
whereas TRIP is good to exchange routes to the PSTN. Definitely it is
possible
to run TRIP across BGCFs and TRIP for gateways between the MGCF and the
BGCF.
These are not part of 3GPP Release 5, but certainly it is a possibility to 
explore for future releases. But still you need SIP to route the session.

draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04 appears to have contradictory rule on
routing of subsequent requests.  15.4 (next to last paragraph) appears
to say that whenever UAC is configured with an outbound proxy, it sends
all subsequent requests there regardless of Request-URI (and so
regardless of route list).

But 16.4.1 appears to say the UAC does this only if there are no Route
headers or UA has no support for DNS.

Which is the intended behavior?
1) always route to outbound proxy
2) use outbound proxy only as last resort, for subsequent requests

and shouldn't one of these be edited so that they agree.

Hi,

The spec is correct - the 2xx MUST contain a session description. For
example, you may receive multiple 18x provisional responses, from
different users, and all with different session descriptions, and you
don't always know (if there aren't any tags) which "belongs" to the 200.

Hi,

This issue was raised on a list a while ago, but after the IETF meeting
I haven't heard anything. I don't even know if it was discussed there
(at least it was not, if I remember correct, on Jonathan's list of open
issues).

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Typically TO & Req URI would be the same when the request originates
(there are cases when this is not true, that's why "typically").
However, at some point, the Req URI will be re-written (mostly towards 
desination) but To will remain unchanged. For example,

TO & Req URI could initiate as  <sales@acme.com>

However, once the request reaches "sip.acme.com" proxy, it could
dynamically rewrite the req URI to <jdoe@callcenter1.acme.com>
while TO still points to <sales@acme.com>

Hello Subir,

	The srv-02 draft defines the term "Outbound Proxy" and updates the
reference RFC 2052 to RFC 2782. 

	These changes are in bis-02 already.

Regards,

Chinmay

No, they are complementary protocols: SIP is the session control protocol,
whereas TRIP is good to exchange routes to the PSTN. Definitely it is
possible
to run TRIP across BGCFs and TRIP for gateways between the MGCF and the
BGCF.
These are not part of 3GPP Release 5, but certainly it is a possibility to 
explore for future releases. But still you need SIP to route the session.

Wow... my recollection is exactly the opposite. Possibly thats biased by my
own opinion on the correct solution, but I could have sworn that people
concurred that we were going to stick with the rule that 4xx response to
re-INVITE did not terminate a call.

Well, someone needs to change. Either UA's change to send BYE, or proxies
and other elements change to support 481 indicated call termination. I
generall prefer pushing intelligence out towards the edge.

Let us definitely resolve this quickly. Please, if you have an opinion,
POST!

Several of the dcsgroup internet-drafts are due to expire this month.
I have submitted updated versions of them to internet-drafts@ietf.org
	draft-dcsgroup-sip-arch-05.txt
	draft-dcsgroup-sip-proxy-proxy-05.txt
	draft-ietf-sip-call-auth-02.txt
	draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks-resource-02.txt
	draft-ietf-sip-state-02.txt

In all cases the most major change was the expiration date.  I also
took the opportunity to fold  in the various nits and corrections
that have appeared on the list, and also those corrections which 
have been sent to me directly.

Until they appear in the normal place, they may be obtained from
	ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/wtm/draft-.....
Also in that same directory are the MSWord .doc files, FYI, which
contain the tracked changes since the last submitted version.

Well, the wording since bis-03 at least is crystal clear in this regard.
From Appendix B:

The usage of SDP within SIP follows an "offer-answer" model. One side offers
an SDP that provides their
view of the session, and the other side answers the SDP with a matching one.
The offer-answer model MAY
occur in two ways. The offer MAY be placed in an INVITE, in which case the
the answer MUST be in a 200
class response, and the ACK MUST NOT contain SDP. Or, the INVITE MAY contain
no SDP, in which case
the offer MUST be in the 200 class response, and the ACK MUST contain the
answer.


Thats pretty darn clear. Both of the two allowed conditions have a MUST for
the 2xx to contain SDP. I will fix the inconsistency with section 12.1.

In any case, since 18x is optional and not even reliable, it would make no
sense to just "skip" the SDP in the 2xx because it was sent in the 1xx.

Seems more regular to insist on having UACs always send BYE. Consider
this a HUM in favor of that approach. Hummmm.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Session Timer
	Author(s)	: S. Donovan, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-06.txt
	Pages		: 30
	Date		: 30-Aug-01
	
This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). This extension allows for a periodic refresh of SIP
sessions through a re-INVITE. The refresh allows both user agents and
proxies to determine if the SIP session is still active. The
extension defines two new general headers, Session-Expires, which
conveys the lifetime of the session, and Min-SE, which conveys the
minimum allowed value for the session timer.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Hi,

We have just submitted a new I-D on negotiation of meta-session parameters
for SIP sessions. Until the draft appears in the archives, you can pick up a
copy at:

http://www.obsidian97.com/draft-spbs-sip-negotiate-00.txt

We invite your comments, the abstract is included below for your perusal.

Thanks,

--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
There is a need to negotiate a multitude of parameters, settings, and
algorithms when setting up sessions using Session Initiated Protocol (SIP).
While SIP itself provides mechanisms for negotiation of these parameters on
a per-session basis through the use of the INVITE method, it does not
provide a ready mechanism for meta-session negotiation. The closest
mechanism provided is the REGISTER method, however, this method is directed
towards the registrar alone, and cannot be used to conduct negotiation of
parameters between any two arbitrary SIP nodes. Examples of parameters that
may need to be negotiated (and thus, the ready impetus for providing a
simple mechanism to handle this) include: compression algorithms, code book
size, message integrity mechanisms, encryption algorithms, etc. Many of
these parameters are not always eligible for use in an INVITE method, for
two reasons: 
	- The INVITE method describes the parameters for initiation of a
particular session. Once the session is over, the negotiated settings (such
as the RTP profile used, in the case of SDP) are invalidated for future
re-use. It would be inefficient to have to renegotiate parameters that are
the same from session to session, or have to transmit large quantities of
persistent data (such as a code book) each time. 
	- Many meta-session applications (and therefore their attendant
negotiable parameters) are best utilized if they can be applied for the
first message of a session. An example of this would be header compression.
If the INVITE were compressed, then the header that identifies the type of
compression in use would also be compressed, and therefore unintelligible
(assuming no shim mechanism). 

This document seeks to solve these problems by introducing a SIP extension
that allows for meta-session parameters to be negotiated in a generic
manner. This negotiation would take place prior to session establishment,
between any two SIP entities (User Agents, Proxies etc.).

 Agreed.  Most of the intelligence belongs at the edge.  Hummm.

Seems more regular to insist on having UACs always send BYE. Consider
this a HUM in favor of that approach. Hummmm.

Jonathan:

I recall having a similar discussion with you on the list in the context of 
the call reconstitution I-D.  The gist of the discussion is that the BYE is
is needed.  Going into the discussion I was unsure why this is so, but have
changed my mind since then.  

The reasons why BYE is preferred are listed in

Hello,

I have a few immediate comments. First, I agree that such
a mechanism is needed. My comments really are 
directed at the details of your proposal.

1) Do we need to define a named extension "negotiate"?
   It seems the Allow: header and the 405 response give
   you everything you need in this regard.

2) Would it be possible to use the OPTIONS method instead?
   I realize this is a bit of a twist on OPTIONS.

   Alternatively, a nested INVITE might work.

3) It seems that some of the information that you
   are negotiating should be applied on a per-session
   basis and should not necessarily be used across
   sessions (e.g keys). Do you anticipate sending a
   NEGOTIATE request before every INVITE? The Expires:
   header doesn't really give you the level of control
   that I'm talking about.

4) For stateless proxy operation, it seems more appropriate
   to include/reiterate the meta session parameters in the
   INVITE. That is, I wouldn't expect a stateless proxy
   to use parameters in the NEGOTIATE for the "next" INVITE.
   Naturally, there are some parameters that will be completely
   meaningless to a stateless proxy. Compression may be one
   example.

5) I would treat NEGOTIATE exactly like SUBSCRIBE with
   respect to forking proxies.

6) In your MD5 hash description, you convert the To/From URL
   to all uppercase. This is a bit pedantic, but wouldn't
   you want to preserve the case of at least the userinfo
   portion of those URLs for uniqueness?

Would future responders to this thread PLEASE remove
the copy to sipping.  If this were to be adopted as a work
item based on this draft, it would be a work item for sip.
It's conceivable we could take a step back and ask 
sipping to do a requirements document.  For the
moment, let's keep the comments on the sip list ONLY.
 
In general NEVER post the same message to sip and
sipping.  If you have a doubt, ask a chair near you.
 
Brian

i brought this same issue up before the london ietf.  i don't think that
there is any conclusion yet.  if a firewall restricts sip traffic only
to the outbound proxy, then 1) is the only possible choice.  one could
argue that in that case the outbound proxy should record route, which
would make the problem go away.  on the other hand, the outbound proxy
may not be controlled by the same entity as the firewall and may not
want to record route.

Subject: RE: [Sipping] SIP Negotiate


Hello, 
I have a few immediate comments. First, I agree that such 
a mechanism is needed. My comments really are 
directed at the details of your proposal. 
1) Do we need to define a named extension "negotiate"? 
   It seems the Allow: header and the 405 response give 
   you everything you need in this regard. 

[SP] Allow typically handles SIP Methods, we were looking at session
     parameters - Code Book size, Compression Algorithms, QoS mechanisms
etc.
     If we extended Allow to perform a Negotiation type role we would have 
     backward compatability issues, also it would be session specific. We
are looking 
     for a mechanism that applies across sessions. 

2) Would it be possible to use the OPTIONS method instead? 
   I realize this is a bit of a twist on OPTIONS. 

[SP] we considered OPTIONS when we started this work and 
     it is our opinion that it would break backwards compatability.

   Alternatively, a nested INVITE might work. 

[SP] If I understand ths correctly you would use the
     INVITE to perform negotiations. I see two problems with
     this approach (please correct me if I have mis-understood):
       ** this would add to delays in setting up sessions
       ** Again an INVITE would do this on a session-by-session basis
          it was our intentions that Negotiated parameters apply across
          sessions.

3) It seems that some of the information that you 
   are negotiating should be applied on a per-session 
   basis and should not necessarily be used across 
   sessions (e.g keys). Do you anticipate sending a 
   NEGOTIATE request before every INVITE? The Expires: 
   header doesn't really give you the level of control 
   that I'm talking about. 

[SP] Agreed certain parameters may need to be negotiated on
     a per session basis. You *could* use Negotiate for such
     situations too, in this case the Expires header does
     not have the same value. As an example we are looking 
     at meta-session parameters that you could negotiate that
     would last across sessions like: compression to your Local 
     Outbound Proxy.

4) For stateless proxy operation, it seems more appropriate 
   to include/reiterate the meta session parameters in the 
   INVITE. That is, I wouldn't expect a stateless proxy 
   to use parameters in the NEGOTIATE for the "next" INVITE. 
   Naturally, there are some parameters that will be completely 
   meaningless to a stateless proxy. Compression may be one 
   example. 
[SP] Agreed there are problems with Stateless proxies and we
     do note that in the document.

5) I would treat NEGOTIATE exactly like SUBSCRIBE with 
   respect to forking proxies. 
[SP] Thanks we will include that in future updates of the document.

6) In your MD5 hash description, you convert the To/From URL 
   to all uppercase. This is a bit pedantic, but wouldn't 
   you want to preserve the case of at least the userinfo 
   portion of those URLs for uniqueness? 
[SP] Its my initial reaction that we should have uniqueness even
     with the conversion to uppercase. But will definitely consider
     removing it if otherwise.

Sean Olson

Sean,
 
For your last question, about the MD5, the reason that we specified all
uppercase prior to the MD5 hash was because there is no requirement that
we're aware of that says that any given SIP node (proxy, UA, etc) has to be
case sensitive, or preserve the case of SIP message headers as they traverse
the network. So, if we didn't specify a case in the algorithm, the two nodes
could come up with two different hash values for the same set of headers.
 
As always, thanks for your comments.
 
Brian

Subject: RE: [Sipping] SIP Negotiate 


Hello, 
I have a few immediate comments. First, I agree that such 
a mechanism is needed. My comments really are 
directed at the details of your proposal. 
1) Do we need to define a named extension "negotiate"? 
   It seems the Allow: header and the 405 response give 
   you everything you need in this regard. 

[SP] Allow typically handles SIP Methods, we were looking at session 
     parameters - Code Book size, Compression Algorithms, QoS mechanisms
etc. 
     If we extended Allow to perform a Negotiation type role we would have 
     backward compatability issues, also it would be session specific. We
are looking 
     for a mechanism that applies across sessions. 

2) Would it be possible to use the OPTIONS method instead? 
   I realize this is a bit of a twist on OPTIONS. 

[SP] we considered OPTIONS when we started this work and 
     it is our opinion that it would break backwards compatability. 

   Alternatively, a nested INVITE might work. 

[SP] If I understand ths correctly you would use the 
     INVITE to perform negotiations. I see two problems with 
     this approach (please correct me if I have mis-understood): 
       ** this would add to delays in setting up sessions 
       ** Again an INVITE would do this on a session-by-session basis 
          it was our intentions that Negotiated parameters apply across 
          sessions. 

3) It seems that some of the information that you 
   are negotiating should be applied on a per-session 
   basis and should not necessarily be used across 
   sessions (e.g keys). Do you anticipate sending a 
   NEGOTIATE request before every INVITE? The Expires: 
   header doesn't really give you the level of control 
   that I'm talking about. 

[SP] Agreed certain parameters may need to be negotiated on 
     a per session basis. You *could* use Negotiate for such 
     situations too, in this case the Expires header does 
     not have the same value. As an example we are looking 
     at meta-session parameters that you could negotiate that 
     would last across sessions like: compression to your Local 
     Outbound Proxy. 

4) For stateless proxy operation, it seems more appropriate 
   to include/reiterate the meta session parameters in the 
   INVITE. That is, I wouldn't expect a stateless proxy 
   to use parameters in the NEGOTIATE for the "next" INVITE. 
   Naturally, there are some parameters that will be completely 
   meaningless to a stateless proxy. Compression may be one 
   example. 
[SP] Agreed there are problems with Stateless proxies and we 
     do note that in the document. 

5) I would treat NEGOTIATE exactly like SUBSCRIBE with 
   respect to forking proxies. 
[SP] Thanks we will include that in future updates of the document. 

6) In your MD5 hash description, you convert the To/From URL 
   to all uppercase. This is a bit pedantic, but wouldn't 
   you want to preserve the case of at least the userinfo 
   portion of those URLs for uniqueness? 
[SP] Its my initial reaction that we should have uniqueness even 
     with the conversion to uppercase. But will definitely consider 
     removing it if otherwise.

Take a look at section 2.1 of the bis draft dealing with SIP URL 
comparison. The user portion of the SIP URL is case-sensitive.
This should be taken into account when determining the call 
leg (based on To:/From: URLs). For example,
"sip:BOB@network.com" is not the same as "sip:bob@network.com"
 
It is a very minor nit. My recommendation would be to include the
user portion in its original case and everything else in lowercase.
This is not strictly correct either. I don't have a perfect solution
in mind. Just something to think about.

Sean,
 
For your last question, about the MD5, the reason that we specified all uppercase prior to the MD5 hash was because there is no requirement that we're aware of that says that any given SIP node (proxy, UA, etc) has to be case sensitive, or preserve the case of SIP message headers as they traverse the network. So, if we didn't specify a case in the algorithm, the two nodes could come up with two different hash values for the same set of headers.
 
As always, thanks for your comments.

Hello, 
I have a few immediate comments. First, I agree that such 
a mechanism is needed. My comments really are 
directed at the details of your proposal. 
1) Do we need to define a named extension "negotiate"? 
   It seems the Allow: header and the 405 response give 
   you everything you need in this regard. 

[SP] Allow typically handles SIP Methods, we were looking at session 
     parameters - Code Book size, Compression Algorithms, QoS mechanisms etc. 
     If we extended Allow to perform a Negotiation type role we would have 
     backward compatability issues, also it would be session specific. We are looking 
     for a mechanism that applies across sessions. 

2) Would it be possible to use the OPTIONS method instead? 
   I realize this is a bit of a twist on OPTIONS. 

[SP] we considered OPTIONS when we started this work and 
     it is our opinion that it would break backwards compatability. 

   Alternatively, a nested INVITE might work. 

[SP] If I understand ths correctly you would use the 
     INVITE to perform negotiations. I see two problems with 
     this approach (please correct me if I have mis-understood): 
       ** this would add to delays in setting up sessions 
       ** Again an INVITE would do this on a session-by-session basis 
          it was our intentions that Negotiated parameters apply across 
          sessions. 

3) It seems that some of the information that you 
   are negotiating should be applied on a per-session 
   basis and should not necessarily be used across 
   sessions (e.g keys). Do you anticipate sending a 
   NEGOTIATE request before every INVITE? The Expires: 
   header doesn't really give you the level of control 
   that I'm talking about. 

[SP] Agreed certain parameters may need to be negotiated on 
     a per session basis. You *could* use Negotiate for such 
     situations too, in this case the Expires header does 
     not have the same value. As an example we are looking 
     at meta-session parameters that you could negotiate that 
     would last across sessions like: compression to your Local 
     Outbound Proxy. 

4) For stateless proxy operation, it seems more appropriate 
   to include/reiterate the meta session parameters in the 
   INVITE. That is, I wouldn't expect a stateless proxy 
   to use parameters in the NEGOTIATE for the "next" INVITE. 
   Naturally, there are some parameters that will be completely 
   meaningless to a stateless proxy. Compression may be one 
   example. 
[SP] Agreed there are problems with Stateless proxies and we 
     do note that in the document. 

5) I would treat NEGOTIATE exactly like SUBSCRIBE with 
   respect to forking proxies. 
[SP] Thanks we will include that in future updates of the document. 

6) In your MD5 hash description, you convert the To/From URL 
   to all uppercase. This is a bit pedantic, but wouldn't 
   you want to preserve the case of at least the userinfo 
   portion of those URLs for uniqueness? 
[SP] Its my initial reaction that we should have uniqueness even 
     with the conversion to uppercase. But will definitely consider 
     removing it if otherwise.

    <P><FONT size=2>Hello, </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>I have a few immediate 
    comments. First, I agree that such </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>a mechanism is 
    needed. My comments really are </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>directed at the 
    details of your proposal. </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>1) Do we need to define a 
    named extension "negotiate"? </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems 
    the Allow: header and the 405 response give </FONT><BR><FONT 
    size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; you everything you need in this regard. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT size=2>[SP] Allow typically handles SIP Methods, we were looking at 
    session</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameters - Code 
    Book size, Compression Algorithms, QoS mechanisms etc.</FONT> <BR><FONT 
    size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we extended Allow to perform a 
    Negotiation type role we would have </FONT><BR><FONT 
    size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; backward compatability issues, also it would 
    be session specific. We are looking </FONT><BR><FONT 
    size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a mechanism that applies across 
    sessions. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT size=2>2) Would it be possible to use the OPTIONS method instead? 
    </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize this is a bit of a twist on 
    OPTIONS. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT size=2>[SP] we considered OPTIONS when we started this work and 
    </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is our opinion that it 
    would break backwards compatability.</FONT> </P>
    <P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, a nested INVITE might work.

I agree with Sean that you don't want to change the content of the headers,
but it is probably wise to normalize the header labels. In 2543bis (section
18.2), one is required to use the full & correct forms of the header labels
as input when cryptographically signing part of a SIP message.

> For your last question, about the MD5, the reason that we specified all
uppercase prior to the MD5 hash was because there is no requirement that
we're aware of that says that any given SIP node (proxy, UA, etc) has to be
case sensitive, or preserve the case of SIP message headers as they traverse
the network. So, if we didn't specify a case in the algorithm, the two nodes
could come up with two different hash values for the same set of headers.

Please excuse me for recycling part of a note from another conversation and
for abusing Hamlet's line. Orry, it's been one of those weeks . . .

The To: field can be envisioned as an indicator TO THE USER (or agents
thereof) of the "intent" or "original target" of a call.

For example:

Let's say my boss goes out of town and forward his phone calls to me.
Somewhere, there's a proxy replacing the RequestURI of his phone with one
that delivers INVITEs to my phone instead.

But when the call shows up at my phone, the To: field is still "boss" (Ok,
sip:boss@neuroses.org) .

So when I look at my GUI before answering a call, I know that the call was
originally to my boss, and has just been delivered to me because of some
sort of call forwarding. I may choose to give this call higher (or lower)
priority than I might otherwise, or do some sort of different handling as I
think appropriate, like not answer "WHASSSUP!!!" at the top of my voice.


Or, software in my phone (or proxy) could do something with this
information. For example, I might have a script in my phone that says "If
a call is To: my boss, play distinctive ring #4, even when I'm in no-ring
mode."

This isn't really "routing" of the call -- it's more "application processing
using supplemental information".
