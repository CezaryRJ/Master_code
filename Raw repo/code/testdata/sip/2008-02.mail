For this reason the Wildcarded Public User Identity concept is introduced i=
n IMS. This allows efficient implicit registration of ranges of numbers or =
sets of sip uri's.

You seem to be describing one of the models covered by the SIPForum in thei=
r SIPConnect specification. Is that what you mean?

 From the point of view of the registrar this seems similar to IMS implicit=
 registration, except that the scale is much larger - there may be *very ma=
ny* implicit registrations generated by this one explicit registration.

I find the case much less compelling than the IMS case.

IMO this is an abuse of REGISTER to a purpose for which it is not well suit=
ed.

Treating it as registration means that there is an *expectation* that the R=
-URI will be translated. That isn't really appropriate in this case. The re=
gistration doesn't specify the mapping anyway - it is configuration in the =
network of all the addresses that belong to the "pbx" that does that. This =
is more appropriately viewed as just a routing operation, and so pushing th=
e address of the enterprise server as a Route header is by far the best cho=
ice. Its only because this has been done using REGISTER that brings up how =
to preserve the old address when it is translated.

	Thanks,
	Paul

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : C. Jennings, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-certs-05.txt
	Pages           : 30
	Date            : 2008-02-01

This draft defines a Credential Service that allows Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP event 
package to discover the certificates of other users.  This mechanism 
allows user agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record 
(AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the
Credential Service, which returns an authenticated response 
containing that certificate.  The Credential Service also allows 
users to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-certs-05.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-certs-05.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-certs-05.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I've requested publication for this draft.

Here's the writeup I submitted along with the pub request, should you  =

be interested.


----------------

The SIP working group hereby requests publication of the document  =

draft-ietf-sip-certs-05 as a Proposed Standard.



    (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
           Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
           document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
           version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

The Document Shepherd is working group chair Dean Willis, who has  =

personally reviewed this version of the document and believes it is  =

ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication.


    (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
           and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
           any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
           have been performed?

The document has been extensively reviewed within the working group  =

and by external reviewers, including security area review.

    (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
           needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
           e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
           AAA, internationalization or XML?

No further review required.


    (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
           issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
           and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
           or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the  =

document, or
           has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
           event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
           that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
           concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this  =

document
           been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the
           disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on
           this issue.

No concerns.

    (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
           represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
           others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
           agree with it?

This document enjoys a high level of working group concurrence,  =

relative to the majority of security-related documents. Essentially  =

the working group as a whole agree with the document, including the  =

ones who actually understand it.

    (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated  =

extreme
           discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
           separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.   =

(It
           should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
           entered into the ID Tracker.)

This shepherd is unaware of any discontent.

    (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
           document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
           http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
           http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
           not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the  =

document
           met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
           Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The shepherd applied idnits 2.06.01. Note that the document does  =

contain a downref to RFC 2898. This downref is explained in the  =

references section of the document and appears to be justified under  =

the procedures of RFC 3967. The following text is quoted from the  =

document:

               This reference is normative.  The mechanisms used in this
               specification from RFC2898 are stable and sutable for use
               in a standards track specification.  RFC2898 has been  =

used
               as a normative reference in several prior standards track
               documents including RFC3185, RFC3370, RFC3962, and
               RFC4656.

The document also received appropriate review from the MIME Types  =

alias and SIP events alias.


    (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
           informative?  Are there normative references to documents  =

that
           are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
           state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
           strategy for their completion?  Are there normative  =

references
           that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
           so, list these downward references to support the Area
           Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

References are properly split, with one valid downward reference as  =

described above.


    (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
           consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
           of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
           extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
           registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
           the document creates a new registry, does it define the
           proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
           procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggest a
           reasonable name for the new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the
           document describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd
           conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG
           can appoint the needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

The IANA actions section appears to be correct, and has undergone  =

appropriate expert review.

    (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
           document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
           code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
           an automated checker?

The document appears to contain no formal language.

    (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
           Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
           Announcement Write-Up?  Recent examples can be found in the
           "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
           announcement contains the following sections:

           Technical Summary


This draft defines a Credential Service that allows Session  =

Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP event  =

package to discover the certificates of other users.  This mechanism  =

allows user agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record  =

(AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the  =

Credential Service, which returns an authenticated response  =

containing that certificate.  The Credential Service also allows  =

users to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys.  =

Several operational modes are defined, wherein the credential service  =

may act only as a distributor of the public key, may also act as a  =

distributor of the encrypted private key, or as the repository and  =

distributor of both the public and private key.



           Working Group Summary

The working group process for this draft was unusually long, spanning  =

several years.




           Document Quality
              Are there existing implementations of the protocol?   =

Have a
              significant number of vendors indicated their plan to
              implement the specification?  Are there any reviewers that
              merit special mention as having done a thorough review,
              e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a
              conclusion that the document had no substantive  =

issues?  If
              there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review,
              what was its course (briefly)?  In the case of a Media  =

Type
              review, on what date was the request posted?

We are currently not aware of any publicly announced implementations  =

of this specification, although one can be built relatively trivially  =

on top of general purpose SIP Events servers, and we are aware of at  =

least one internal prototype implemented in this manner.

MIME type review was non-controversial and was initiated on March 12,  =

2007. Bj=F6rn H=F6hrmann raised several points, which were resolved in  =

the -04 version of this specification.

SIP Events review was performed by Adam Roach, with several issues  =

being noted and resolved in -03 of this specification.

Hi Rohan and all,
   
  I can't find the discussing about the connection reuse when NAT/Firewall involved. Sorry if it is documented somewhere already. Here's my comments:
   
   
    
   SIP UA behind a NAT/Firewall using TCP: According to the current draft (08), the UA and proxy have to create bi-direction connections. It seems that it is impossible for the proxy (at the public side of the firewall) to make a new TCP connection to the phone for incoming requests without reusing the phones existing TCP connection with the proxy.  
   SIP UA behind a NAT using TCP to register to the server: The only possible way a UA can receive incoming calls is to reuse the TCP connection that it has created to register with the proxy/registrar.
   
  For the above two reasons, I think it would be better to treat the TCP/SCTP the same way as the TLS. It would make the design and implementation simple. The SIP routing behavior would be consistent when supporting the connection reuse draft.
   
  As the TCP security concerns are discussed in the section 9.3 Security Considerations for the TCP Transport, the first 3 attacks can be prevented by Digest authentications. I cant figure out what is the last case all about (Proxy enter an aliasing agreement with downstream proxy)?  If there are services between these two proxies, they will create connections, one or two, anyway. What are really the concerns here?
   
  Regards,
  Jerry

That particular behavior is documented in sip-outbound
(see Section 2 of connect-reuse for a reference to the discussion
delineating connect-reuse and sip-outbound.)  sip-outbound can be
accessed from: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-11

As it turns out, we are about to release -09 based on the WGLC review
in November.  Brett and I are trying to close an open issue between
us, and once that is done, -09 will be released later this week.
-09 provides more succinct reasons why TCP/SCTP cannot be reused and
it also shortens considerably Section 9.3 based on the WGLC review
feedback.

Thanks,

Thanks to everyone who responded to my earlier query (Target Refresh Request
and Contact Header thread).

I now have a similar query for establishing the Remote Target. Please
forgive the length in advance and feel free to insert corrections/input as
necessary.

From section 12.1 of RFC 3261, the following is stated:
Within this specification, only 2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag,
where the request was INVITE, will establish a dialog.

This seems to indicate that either a 2xx or 101-199 response (with a To tag)
to the initial INVITE can establish a dialog (confirmed vs early dialog
respectively), correct?

Then, from section 12.1.1 of RFC 3261, the following is added about the
response that establishes the dialog:
When a UAS responds to a request with a response that establishes a dialog
(such as a 2xx to INVITE), the UAS MUST copy all Record-Route header field
values from the request into the response (including the URIs, URI
parameters, and any Record-Route header field parameters, whether they are
known or unknown to the UAS) and MUST maintain the order of those values.
The UAS MUST add a Contact header field to the response.

This seems to indicate that the first 101-199 response sent from the
UAS/received at the UAC (with a To Tag) must contain a Contact header (to
set the Remote Target at the UAC), correct? So, if the Contact header is not
received in this response, this would be considered a violation of the spec
and an invalid response, correct? Also, according to the following section (
12.1.2), this also sets up the dialog state (items like the route set, if
not empty, and the Remote Target).

Section 12.2 of RFC 3261 goes into additional details of when the Remote
Target can be changed (ie, Remote Target Refresh):
Requests within a dialog MAY contain Record-Route and Contact header
fields.  However, these requests do not cause the dialog's route set to be
modified, although they may modify the remote target URI. Specifically,
requests that are not target refresh requests do not modify the dialog's
remote target URI, and requests that are target refresh requests do.  For
dialogs that have been established with an INVITE, the only target refresh
request defined is re-INVITE (see Section 14).  Other extensions may define
different target refresh requests for dialogs established in other ways.
      Note that an ACK is NOT a target refresh request.
Target refresh requests only update the dialog's remote target URI, and not
the route set formed from the Record-Route.  Updating the latter would
introduce severe backwards compatibility problems with RFC 2543-compliant
systems.

This seems to indicate that after the 101-199 response is received (that
establishes the dialog), only the re-INVITE and its 2xx response and UPDATE
(per RFC 3311) and its 2xx response can change the Remote Target. Therefore,
if a subsequent provisional response to the INVITE (ie, 180 Ringing that
followed a 183 Session Progress) is received, it is not allowed to update
the Remote Target if it contains a Contact header, correct? What about an
UPDATE received in the early dialog state? This would also allow the Remote
Target to be updated, correct?

Thanks again,
David Roan

I think everything you have said is right. These are some very fuzzy areas.

Note that an *unreliable* provisional response can establish an early 
dialog. But because it is unreliable the UAS can't immediately know if 
the UAC is aware of the dialog.

It is somewhere between very tricky and impossible to change the target 
during an early dialog. If you haven't found it yet, you should take a 
look at the race-examples draft 
(draft-ietf-sipping-race-examples-04.txt) for more discussion of this 
sort of subtle point.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the response.

So, if the provisional responses are sent reliably, the provisional
response would have an acking mechanism similar to the 2xx to ensure the
dialog is established (ie, the chance of lost messaging is greatly
diminished by the resending of Provisional Responses and the PRACK request),
correct?

I checked RFC 3262 wrt this and found the following:
If a provisional response is received for an initial request, and that
response contains a Require header field containing the option tag 100rel,
the response is to be sent reliably.  If the response is a 100 (Trying) (as
opposed to 101 to 199), this option tag MUST be ignored, and the procedures
below MUST NOT be used.
The provisional response MUST establish a dialog if one is not yet created.

This does not really indicate a dialog state, but this would still be an
early dialog, right? Or, would it be confirmed since, like the 2xx, there is
an ACK mechanism to ensure it is received?

Thanks again for the insight and the pointer to the race condition draft,
David Roan

This will be an early dialog.

	Hi Paul,
	=20
	Thanks for the response.
	=20
	So, if the provisional responses are sent reliably, the
provisional response would have an acking mechanism similar to the 2xx
to ensure the dialog is established (ie, the chance of lost messaging is
greatly diminished by the resending of Provisional Responses and the
PRACK request), correct?
	=20
	I checked RFC 3262 wrt this and found the following:
	If a provisional response is received for an initial request,
and that response contains a Require header field containing the option
tag 100rel, the response is to be sent reliably.  If the response is a
100 (Trying) (as opposed to 101 to 199), this option tag MUST be
ignored, and the procedures below MUST NOT be used.
	The provisional response MUST establish a dialog if one is not
yet created.
	=20
	This does not really indicate a dialog state, but this would
still be an early dialog, right? Or, would it be confirmed since, like
the 2xx, there is an ACK mechanism to ensure it is received?
	=20
	Thanks again for the insight and the pointer to the race
condition draft,
	David Roan

Because TMDA has been removed from all the IETF lists, SPAM is now
making its way through the SIP list. It is clear that the alternative
mechanisms are not working effectively.

It you fail to receive this message it is because it is too late....

1)	Please check that when you post a message, that it is
distributed. You can check the archives to do this at:

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/index.html

2)	If you are failing to receive messages from the SIP list, then
check whether ietf.org, or any part of it, has been blacklisted by
either your local or company SPAM filtering.

Any issues, mail ietf-action@ietf.org

This is the transition team responsible for these changes.

Regards

Further, if you send a message that you think needs to be released from
the moderation queue, then send me a mail directly.

The moderation queue of the SIP list is now filling up with SPAM
messages, and I will probably find it impossible to separate your speck
of gold from the crap.

That particular behavior is documented in sip-outbound
(see Section 2 of connect-reuse for a reference to the discussion
delineating connect-reuse and sip-outbound.) sip-outbound can be
accessed from: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-11

   
  [Jerry Yin] Hi Vijay, thanks for the response. The outbound draft is exactly reuse the client started connection as I indicated in the previous mail. It seems there's an inconsistency between these two drafts.

As it turns out, we are about to release -09 based on the WGLC review
in November. Brett and I are trying to close an open issue between
us, and once that is done, -09 will be released later this week.
-09 provides more succinct reasons why TCP/SCTP cannot be reused and
it also shortens considerably Section 9.3 based on the WGLC review
feedback.
  
[Jerry Yin] Looking forward to read your new draft.
  thanks, 
  Jerry
   
  
Thanks,

- vijay

Hi Jerry,

Please read the section 2.  The NAT/Firewall issues are not to be solved
by the reuse draft.

Right.

3261 is very carefully worded, because it only provides one way of 
establishing a dialog, and doesn't include reliable provisionals, but 
the specs for reliable provisionals were progressed in parallal so 3261 
"left room" for them as well as for other ways of establishing a dialog 
(like SUB/NOT).

It is still an early dialog, but its a way of *knowing* you have one.

Even if you don't use PRACK, I guess any other mid-dialog request from
the UAC to the UAS would also "indication" that the early dialog has
been established.

However, that does NOT mean that any SDP previously sent in an
unreliable 18x would be regarded as an offer/answer.

Also, regarding Paul's earlier comment that a target cannot be updated
during the early dialog. It is possible using UPDATE, isn't it (yes, I
agree with possible race condition issues)?

Yes, I think an intelligent UA can infer that receipt of an in-dialog 
request implies that the other end knows of the dialog. I am however 
unaware of any normative language about this. As a result YMMV when 
attempting such usage.

I'm not certain what you are saying. To paraphrase what I think you 
might mean:

A new offer MUST NOT be sent within an early dialog that has not been 
confirmed with reliable response.

The mechanisms are there to refresh the target, but are fraught with 
race conditions to the point that it is unwise to attempt.

I am not sure whether we would need any extra text: the 18x creates the
early dialog (as far as the UAC is concerned), and on early dialogs you
can send mid-dialog requests.

Now, whether all implementations out there work that way I don't know :)

Correct.

And, an SDP that was sent unreliably is NOT an answer (or offer) even if
mid-dialog requests has been received from the UAC after that.

   This seems to indicate that after the 101-199 response is received (that
   establishes the dialog), only the re-INVITE and its 2xx response and UPDATE
   (per RFC 3311) and its 2xx response can change the Remote Target. Therefore,
   if a subsequent provisional response to the INVITE (ie, 180 Ringing that
   followed a 183 Session Progress) is received, it is not allowed to update
   the Remote Target if it contains a Contact header, correct?

Everything you say is correct, as far as I know.  But there is one
treacherous point that many phones do not get right:  If a 1xx is
received, it establishes an early dialog, and sets the remote target.
If a second 1xx is received *with a different to-tag*, it establishes
*another* early dialog, and sets the remote target of that dialog.
Thus, the remote targets in the two 1xx responses are entirely
unconnected.

That works for the UAC. The UAS sent the 1xx and thinks there is an 
early dialog, and the UAC received it and agrees, so it can send a new 
request in-dialog.

The problem is for the UAS. It has *sent* the 1xx with to-tag so it 
thinks there is a dialog, but the UAC may never receive it. Now if the 
UAS sends an in-dialog request, it is a *bit* of a stretch to assume the 
UAC will be prepared to receive and handle it.

This *is* discussed in the race-examples draft. The assumption is that 
the UAC *ought* to make this inference, but there may be no normative 
support for it. The exception is for SUB/NOT, where there is a 
requirement to handle a NOTIFY where no dialog has yet been established. 
This is a very similar case.

> Now, whether all implementations out there work that way I don't know :)

Yes, that *is* the question. And further, whether an implementation that 
*doesn't* act that way can be declared non-compliant.

You can use gruu in any non-REGISTER request.

You don't need an INVITE, you only need to REGISTER the UA
to get a gruu.

from http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-13.txt :

3.3.  Using a GRUU

   Once a user agent obtains GRUUs from the registrar, it uses them in
   several ways.  First, it uses them as the contents of the Contact
   header field in non-REGISTER requests and responses that it emits
   (for example, an INVITE request and 200 OK response).

Attila

Hi Attila,

sorry maybe I wasn't clear in my question.

My problem is:
I send out a MESSAGE to a AoR, and I want be sure that the receiver of 
the MESSAGE
(if he wants to reply to the MESSAGE) will send out the reply to the 
same UA I used to send out the MESSAGE.
Now, how is it possible if I can not insert a Contact header with my 
GRUU within the MESSAGE ?

/sal

MESSAGE forbids the inclusion of Contact because it was not intended for 
message sessions. If you want to include a place you can be reached, you 
could use the Reply-To header. What you put in such a header is up to you.

In draft-ietf-sip-media-security-requirements-02, I changed the following
requirement from MAY to MUST:

   R-REUSE  The media security key management protocol MUST support the
         re-use of a previously established security context, and
         implementations SHOULD implement the re-use mechanism.

A discussion of this requirement appears in Section 4.6 of the document,
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-media-security-requirements-02#secti
on-4.6


Does anyone have equipment that they would implement this feature in?  In the
past, I have heard that some embedded devices (intelligent SIMs) could benefit
from key re-use.

Would it be reasonable to soften this requirement back to a MAY?

Based on the feedback from the -00 draft, I've added a section that  
details the changes this draft makes
in a more descriptive form (in addition to the patching-the-text form  
that already exists).

Please look at the new section 7 and see if this addresses the  
concerns around the document format.

I also spent some time experimenting with the suggestions to provide  
the changes in a diff format and have
not found anything promising. For the sake of discussion, I did  
prepare a patch file that I'll send in a separate
message. I'm becoming more convinced that that's the wrong approach  
to take though. We really don't want
to create some form of derived document that's the "current spec". If  
we really want a new document, lets create
a bis and be done with it.

The point of creating the patch-the-text form in the first place was  
not to facilitate creating a new
document out of the old document. It was done so that the impact of  
the changes on the spec is
expressed in as unambiguous a form as possible. The worst outcome  
would be an update that
_didn't_ make these explicit statements and half of the implementors  
in the world end up looking
at a section and saying "Oh, I didn't know it meant to change _that_".

The IESG has approved the following document:

- 'A Framework for Consent-based Communications in the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) '
   <draft-ietf-sip-consent-framework-04.txt> as a Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working 
Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Cullen Jennings and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-consent-framework-04.txt

Technical summary. 

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across many
media types,  including real-time audio, video, text, instant messaging, 
and presence. In its current  form, it allows session invitations, instant


 
messages, and other requests to be delivered from one party to another 
without requiring explicit consent of the recipient. Without such consent,
it is possible for SIP to be used for malicious purposes,  including 
amplification, and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This document 
identifies a framework for consent-based communications in SIP. 

Working group summary. 

There is consensus in the working group to publish this document. The
document came about due to security area concerns about the need to 
protect against denial of service attacks and amplification attacks 
when various relay and uri-list mechanisms are used in SIP. 

Document Quality 

The document has been extensively reviewed and discussed by the SIP WG
since 2004.

As I said in my last message, I think this kind of thing is the wrong  
thing to do.
But it came up in both Chicago and Vancouver, so to inform the  
discussion, here's a patch file
that you can run against rfc3261 to render the invfix changes.

Among the other evils this path seems to tend towards - it creates  
something that looks like an RFC
that isn't. In what I hope isn't too feeble an attempt to create  
confusion, a lot of the patch is to the footer
line of each page saying that the result is NOT 3261.

To use this, put it, and a copy of 3261 you don't mind destroying,  
into a directory and run

patch < invfix.patch

RjS

I've heard that a number of folks are not getting messages off this  
list correctly.

This may or may not have to do with the IETF's server transition, but  
things have been in play since lat Friday. Hopefully, they're settling  
down now.

But if you post something to the list, please doublecheck that it made  
it into the Mailman archive, which you can see online at:

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/index.html'

And if you're missing messages:

1) Try resubscribing - -some people apaprently got dropped
2) Try checking that you haven't been set  "nomail" due to bounces
3) Read your missing mail on the web archive, as linked above
4) and let me know if there is a chronic problem. I can't do anything,  
but I can share your pain.

Robert,
=20
So we have two sections containing RFC 2119 language and saying the same
thing in different ways. If section 7 is just a description, as it
claims, then should it not avoid RFC 2119 language. Otherwise, which
section takes precedence in the event of a conflict?
=20
John

	Based on the feedback from the -00 draft, I've added a section
that details the changes this draft makes=20
	in a more descriptive form (in addition to the patching-the-text
form that already exists).

	Please look at the new section 7 and see if this addresses the
concerns around the document format.

	I also spent some time experimenting with the suggestions to
provide the changes in a diff format and have
	not found anything promising. For the sake of discussion, I did
prepare a patch file that I'll send in a separate
	message. I'm becoming more convinced that that's the wrong
approach to take though. We really don't want
	to create some form of derived document that's the "current
spec". If we really want a new document, lets create
	a bis and be done with it.

	The point of creating the patch-the-text form in the first place
was not to facilitate creating a new
	document out of the old document. It was done so that the impact
of the changes on the spec is
	expressed in as unambiguous a form as possible. The worst
outcome would be an update that
	_didn't_ make these explicit statements and half of the
implementors in the world end up looking=20
	at a section and saying "Oh, I didn't know it meant to change
_that_".

		To: RjS@nostrum.com
		Subject: New Version Notification for
draft-sparks-sip-invfix-01=20


		A new version of I-D, draft-sparks-sip-invfix-01.txt has
been successfuly submitted by Robert Sparks and posted to the IETF
repository.

		Filename: draft-sparks-sip-invfix
		Revision: 01
		Title: Correct transaction handling for 200 responses to
Session Initiation Protocol INVITE requests
		Creation_date: 2008-02-07
		WG ID: Independent Submission
		Number_of_pages: 18

		Abstract:
		This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session
Initiation
		Protocol (SIP), to address an error in the specified
handling of
		success (200 class) responses to INVITE requests.
Elements following
		RFC 3261 exactly will misidentify retransmissions of the
request as a
		new, unassociated, request.  The correction involves
modifying the
		INVITE transaction state machines.  The correction also
changes the
		way responses that cannot be matched to an existing
transaction are
		handled to address a security risk.



		The IETF Secretariat.

Sorry Salvatore,
Clearly, my MESSAGE knowledge is not complete (didn't realise there was
a special requirement not to include Contact).

Thankfully, Paul and Jonathan have answered your questions.

Regards,
Attila

Hi Attila,

sorry maybe I wasn't clear in my question.

My problem is:
I send out a MESSAGE to a AoR, and I want be sure that the receiver of
the MESSAGE (if he wants to reply to the MESSAGE) will send out the
reply to the same UA I used to send out the MESSAGE.
Now, how is it possible if I can not insert a Contact header with my
GRUU within the MESSAGE ?

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : R. Mahy, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-09.txt
	Pages           : 20
	Date            : 2008-02-08

This document enables a pair of communicating proxies to reuse a
congestion-controlled connection between themselves for sending
requests in the forward and backwards direction.  Because the
connection is essentially aliased for requests going in the backwards
direction, reuse should be predicated upon both the communicating
endpoints authenticating themselves using X.509 certificates through
TLS.  For this reason, we only consider connection reuse for TLS over
TCP and TLS over SCTP.  A single connection cannot be reused for the
TCP or SCTP transport between two peers, and this document provides
insight into why this is the case.  As a remedy, it suggests using
two TCP connections (or two SCTP associations), each opened pro-
actively towards the recipient by the sender.  Finally, this document
also provides guidelines on connection reuse and virtual SIP servers
and the interaction of connection reuse and DNS SRV lookups in SIP.

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-09.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Folks: I have just submitted connect-reuse-09 that includes Dale's
  and Hadriel's extensive WGLC review.

The following is a synopsis of changes:

- Added definitions for persistent connections, connect reuse and shared
   connections.
- Updated S2 to stress that connection reuse is best done for
   TLS; for TCP and SCTP it should only be used with certain caveats.
- Took out S5.2 and S5.3.
- Added text saying that the alias table is not mandatory.
- Considerably shortened S9.3 (Security considerations for TCP
   transports).
- The malware and hi-jacking scenario is fairly convoluted to follow;
   replaced it with Hadriel's suggestion to keep it simple.
- Redid the discussion on virtual servers based on Dale's review
   and subsequent WG discussion.  The resulting section is much shorter
   and considerably clearer than before.

The -09 version is available in the IETF archives for your
review and comments:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-09.txt

Thanks,

The other week I interviewed Skype's general manager of audio and video.

When asked a question regarding SIP, he responded:

"I think that the vision of the early SIP founders has been largely
unreal in the SIP world. SIP is typically just used for this mundane
trunking application like the one we have or sending calls between two
networks and it is just calls. The vision of multi-modal
communications and rich end points has largely failed within the same
and I think that a big part of this is that they did not pragmatically
just solve basic problems like NAT traversal for example and they also
evolved the specification to the point that it is no longer had its
light weight appeal. So, we will see, SIP will continue to be dominant
protocol in terms of this sort of narrowly defined scenarios but I
think when it comes to rich communications, you are going to see more
of this fragmentation. You are going to see some islands of providers
who are just solving the problems. Just making it work for the user
and not being religious about the protocol for example."

For full transcript see:

Thought this may be of interest.

Lee

My opinion is that those requirements need to go to sipping first for
discussion as sipping is, as I understand it, chartered to agree on
requirements before any extension work is taken up by the sip wg.

Thanks,
Hisham

Hi Dan,

MUST specify, SHOULD implement and MAY use seems fine for me.

I can imagine that not only end hosts would benefit from this mechanisms.

There are two mechanisms that offered slightly different functionality 
regarding this security context reuse, namely
* Re-use of a previously established security context based on state 
that has been established by both end points
* Re-use of a previously established security context by caching 
security context only on the client side.

I can imagine that both approaches are useful in certain scenarios. The 
requirement does not differentiate these two cases.

Ciao
Hannes

Hi All,

    In SIP outbound draft 11 it was mentioned that flow back to
particular UA can be Identified based on instance-id and reg-id=2E

Then what is the need for flow-token=2E

Is this flow-token is used only in case of edge-proxy support?

If it is so what is the need of instance-id in case of edge-proxy=2E

Thanks & Regards,

Karthikeyan=2EG

Hi All,

   How to identify edge-proxy in this topology?

=20

UA - P1 - P2 - P3 - REGISTRAR=20

=20

Here in this case P1 and P3 are Edge proxy's as per Path header RFC
3327=2E

=20

=20

Edge proxy P1 can be identified based on VIA=2E

=20

Then how to edge proxy identify P3?

=20

Thanks & Regards,

Karthikeyan=2EG

The SIP, SIPPING and MEDIACTRL chairs (or at least a representative collection of them) did get together to consider this issue, and decided that as the work (as currently proposed) did not in fact extend SIP, that MEDIACTRL should retain the work. 

SDP extensions are proposed to MMUSIC, and that would appear to be appropriate.

At some point when the work is complete enough for review, it was agreed that RAI wide review of this document should occur, and one of the review experts in the SIP WG will be jumped on at that point to review the solution.

We did not discuss whether the solution adopted by the draft was the correct solution - if people in the SIP WG have concerns, then please address them to the MEDIACTRL WG. If you are not participants in that WG then we (the SIP chairs) will be pleased to forward on comments.

Regards

PS: My understanding of the various charters is that SIP does not generate requirements for development of SIP, except in the security area. However it can charter work based on requirements from any appropriate working group, which includes among others, both SIPPING and MEDIACTRL. I suspect the ADs would want to be confident that the appropriate experts had contributed to the appropriate requirements.

	My opinion is that those requirements need to go to sipping first for discussion as sipping is, as I understand it, chartered to agree on requirements before any extension work is taken up by the sip wg.

Even more informative is this section:

   When the 'rsa-sha1' algorithm [the default - DW] is specified in
   the 'alg' parameter of Identity-Info, the hash and signature MUST
   be generated as follows: compute the results of signing this string
   with sha1WithRSAEncryption as described in RFC 3370 [7] and base64
   encode the results as specified in RFC 3548 [8].  [...]  The result
   is placed in the Identity header field.

So the text of the specification says that the Identity value must be
a base64 string, while the ABNF gives it as hex digits.

Folks: We have submitted draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-00 as part
  of the SIP Essential Corrections Process.  This memo corrects the
  Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) production rule associated with
  generating IPv6 literals in RFC3261.  It also clarifies the rule for
  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) comparison when the URIs contain
  textual representation of IP addresses.

Until the draft is available in the archives, you can get a copy
from:
https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/gurbani/sip-ipv6-abnf/draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-00.txt
https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/gurbani/sip-ipv6-abnf/draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-00.html

The ABNF part of the draft was already documented in the predecessor
  version (draft-gurbani-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-00).  The new draft
  includes the additional discussion we had on the WG list around URI
  comparison when textual IP addresses occur in the URI.  Please review
  sections related to that portion.

Thanks,

- vijay

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Essential correction for IPv6 ABNF and URI comparison in RFC3261
	Author(s)       : V. Gurbani, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-00.txt
	Pages           : 9
	Date            : 2008-02-15

This memo corrects the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) production
rule associated with generating IPv6 literals in RFC3261.  It also
clarifies the rule for Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) comparison
when the URIs contain textual representation of IP addresses.

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-00.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

John,

Thanks for opening this can of worms. It is a very important problem to 
solve.

Did you intend for this to be discussed on the SIP WG mailing list?

>    When a UA receives an E.164 number represented as a SIP URI in a From
>    header field, what does this say about the source of the request?  Of

I'm not convinced about the above. It depends on what you mean by "should".

The existing rules for use of SIP URIs don't require that the user be 
reachable from the PSTN, or that the user have any relationship to the 
pstn number. The user part is still wholly the responsibility of the domain.

A corollary is that there are significant issues about how the recipient 
displays the identity of the caller. If the identity is displayed based 
solely on the e.164 number, without the domain, then it is a 
misrepresentation precisely because reverse routing using the e.164 
number may well not reach the same place.

This argument isn't very compelling to me. Nobody using the PSTN expects 
to see the enterprise name as part of the calling "number". PSTN caller 
id with calling name might be relevant, but it isn't a domain name.

If you want to use sip domain names for authorization purposes, then it 
makes more sense to use *real* sip URIs.

>    REQ2:  When a UAS receives a SIP request that includes a SIP or SIPS
>       URI identifying the originating user, if that URI contains an

Your examples all include ;user=phone, but none of the text says that 
you mean that when talking about sip URIs that contain E.164 numbers. I 
am somewhat inclined to agree with this requirement if user=phone is 
present, but otherwise not.

IMO, rather than trying to fix up the handling of sip URIs containing 
phone numbers we would be better off trying to fix up the use of TEL URIs.

The main limitation of TEL URIs is the inability of sip identity to deal 
with them. What we need is a way to extend identity to them in such a 
way that it truly proves ownership of the number, in whatever sense of 
ownership we want it to mean.

I think that can be achieved by translating a TEL URI to its ENUM dotted 
inverted number domain name format, and then applying sip identity to 
that. It means that if I am the end user assigned usage of 
TEL:+1978-555-1234 then *I* or some middle box acting as my agent, must 
have a certificate for 4.3.2.1.5.5.5.8.7.9.1.e164.ansi.

	Thanks,
	Paul

I agree and have an additional question:

What happens if the phone number is actually owned by the end user due
to number portability? It seems in this case a database service is the
essential ingredient.

This is an excellent I-D and I suggest we use it to clear up all these
issues.

Thanks, Henry

I just submitted a new I-D, which proposes a protocol called TOTE:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-tote-00.txt

Basically, TOTE provides the ability to exchange MIME objects of any 
type and "purpose" over a tcp/tls connection established e2e through SDP 
O/A procedures and ICE-tcp. This ties into the INFO disussion; it 
provides the media-plane equivalent of the INFO-events framework.

This draft should arguably go in mmusic but since the INFO debate is 
happening here I submitted it as a -sip.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

So far you're the only person to respond to my email.  I had asked for
feedback because I had received push-back on the requirement to store state
from previous sessions, because such storage weakens the security of the
system by destroying perfect forward secrecy.  PFS is a 'must be able to
support' requirement in the document right now.  Any thoughts on this
requirements collision?

On the second bullet, I assume you are referring to RFC5077 ("TLS Session
Resumption without Server-Side State")?

Should the requirement be reworded to differentiate between those two cases?

It appears that we will get only 2 hours of working group meeting time 
in Philadelphia.

That means we're going to have to be VERY efficient with our use of time.

What are the mosr important things? The things we REALLY need to talk 
about? Inquiring minds want to know.

Here are the things on our charter we're currently late on:

  1) Outbound
  2) SIPS (which I think is pretty much done)
  3) Diagnostic Responses
  4) Example security flows
  5) Extensions to SIP UA Profile Delivery Change Notification Event 
Package for XCAP
  6) Location Conveyance with SIP
  7) Connection reuse mechanism
  8) Session Policies
  9) Etags in conditional notification
10) Using SAML for SIP
11) New resource priority namespaces for DISA
12) Requirements for media keying
13) X.509 Certificates for TLS use in SIP (done?)
14) X.509 extended key usage for SIP (done?)
15) Roadmap for SIP
16) Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy
17) Establishment of secure media sessions using DTLS-SRT
18) MIME body handling in SIP
19) Identify requirements for test matrix to move SIP to Draft Standard

And the things we aren't late on yet:

1) Essential corrections to RFC 3261 (1st batch)
2) Mechanisms for UA initiated privacy to WGLC


So c'mon, people. What do we need to talk about? And why aren't we 
talking about it on the list already?

Very cool draft.

So with the right MIME object (octet-stream?) and Purpose token 
(iptunnel?), we appear to have an instant answer for the "How do we use 
SIP to set up a VPN connection" problem. Subject to the constraints of 
TCP, of course, which some people don't like. And we have a solution for 
the problem of establishing a device management connection with a device 
that's behind a NAT router.

Seriously: This draft is an exact answer to the question "what is the 
extension model for SIP?" We very much need to come to an agreement on 
that model, and stop extending SIP along three different and 
incompatible axes.

If we choose the model of TOTE, then we might start considering 
deprecation of INFO, MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE, and NOTIFY. We can also 
probably deprecate MSRP. And PUBLISH, of course. This would really clean 
up the protocol suite, at least for one way of looking at it.

This is a lot to think about. So start thinking!

I would like to comment on PFS:

The definition of the PFS in the Handbook of Applied Cryptography says:

"A protocol is said to have perfect forward secrecy if compromise of 
long-term keys
does not compromise past session keys."

Now, there is only the question what "long-term key" means in this context.

Hence, I am not so sure that PFS is destroyed with the ability to store 
session state. Furthermore, both parties can decide not to use it.

I would at least indicate that there are two forms of caching with 
somewhat different properties here.

Hi Dean,
 
One thing missing from your list is INFO. I am not sure whether we are "late" or not, but just keep in minds that there are other SDOs which may need the output. I am not sure how much time we would need to discuss it, but since we now have collected use-cases etc I think we should make some kind of decission on how to move forward.
 
Another thing missing, which has been discussed (again) lately is the how-to-reject-an-offer-in-PRACK. I wouldn't say that we are late on that, and for now I guess we can keep the discussion on the list if there is no time at the meeting.
 
Regards,
 
Christer

Subject: [Sip] Headsup on Short Agenda for IETF 71



It appears that we will get only 2 hours of working group meeting time
in Philadelphia.

That means we're going to have to be VERY efficient with our use of time.

What are the mosr important things? The things we REALLY need to talk
about? Inquiring minds want to know.

Here are the things on our charter we're currently late on:

  1) Outbound
  2) SIPS (which I think is pretty much done)
  3) Diagnostic Responses
  4) Example security flows
  5) Extensions to SIP UA Profile Delivery Change Notification Event
Package for XCAP
  6) Location Conveyance with SIP
  7) Connection reuse mechanism
  8) Session Policies
  9) Etags in conditional notification
10) Using SAML for SIP
11) New resource priority namespaces for DISA
12) Requirements for media keying
13) X.509 Certificates for TLS use in SIP (done?)
14) X.509 extended key usage for SIP (done?)
15) Roadmap for SIP
16) Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy
17) Establishment of secure media sessions using DTLS-SRT
18) MIME body handling in SIP
19) Identify requirements for test matrix to move SIP to Draft Standard

And the things we aren't late on yet:

1) Essential corrections to RFC 3261 (1st batch)
2) Mechanisms for UA initiated privacy to WGLC


So c'mon, people. What do we need to talk about? And why aren't we
talking about it on the list already?

Hi Jonathan,
 
Interesting draft.
 
One question: is your intention that this would be the ONLY way of using INFO in SIP, or would it be one alternative?
 
The drawback with media planes based solutions is of course that any intermediate interested in the information must have access to the media plane, which may not always be the case.
 
Regards,
 
Christer

Subject: [Sip] New I-D - TOTE - "INFO" on the media path



I just submitted a new I-D, which proposes a protocol called TOTE:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-tote-00.txt

Basically, TOTE provides the ability to exchange MIME objects of any
type and "purpose" over a tcp/tls connection established e2e through SDP
O/A procedures and ICE-tcp. This ties into the INFO disussion; it
provides the media-plane equivalent of the INFO-events framework.

This draft should arguably go in mmusic but since the INFO debate is
happening here I submitted it as a -sip.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Hi Jonathan,
 
Chapter 2 of the draft says:
 
"All TOTE implementations support at least the lite versionof Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) for TCP [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp]."
 
Now, as far as I know we haven't specified any ICE lite procedures for TCP. ice-tcp-05 (do I read the wrong version?) also says:
 
"Because this specification requires multiple candidates for a media stream, it is not compatible with ICE's lite implementation, and can only be used by full implementations."
 
Now, different alternatives regarding this were discussed in Vancouver, and one of the proposals discussed was to implementing "TCP ICE lite" simply by removing the candidates, use the RFC 4145 "fallback" - and specify that ICE could still be used for UDP based streams.
 
As you said, though, I guess the detailed discussion of the proposal belongs to MMUSIC...
 
Regards,
 
Christer

Subject: [Sip] New I-D - TOTE - "INFO" on the media path



I just submitted a new I-D, which proposes a protocol called TOTE:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-tote-00.txt

Basically, TOTE provides the ability to exchange MIME objects of any
type and "purpose" over a tcp/tls connection established e2e through SDP
O/A procedures and ICE-tcp. This ties into the INFO disussion; it
provides the media-plane equivalent of the INFO-events framework.

This draft should arguably go in mmusic but since the INFO debate is
happening here I submitted it as a -sip.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

It would be one of three alternatives for "application signaling". The 
other two being the existing event framework, and the other being the 
newly proposed info framework.

I am nearly done with a draft which I'll submit shortly that provides 
guidance on selection of a mechanism. I think there are cases for all three.

Exactly. In those cases you'd use a signaling path solution.

I just submitted the following short I-D:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-info-litmus-00.txt

This proposes some litmus tests in evaluating whether an application 
should use the INFO framework, TOTE or the sip events framework.

A DTLS-SRTP implementation would have both the server and client
cache the TLS Session Id, and remember the Session Id between
phone calls.  This means the TLS security parameters and keys, 
and thus the SRTP key (which is derived from the TLS security
parametersa and keys), are remembered between phone calls.  

As far as I am aware, there is no guidance for how long (hours)
this information is expected to be retained.

If _either_ party stores the information, compromise of that
device (the one which stored the information) destroys PFS.  So 
even if I have configured my device to not store such information, 
whoever I'm calling might not have configured it that way.  There 
is no mechanism, currently, to negotiate or communicate if you
want the remote party to cache TLS session information.  Perhaps
RFC5077 could be used as the negotiation mechanism, such that
if both sides implement RFC5077 they are agreeing to caching
session information.  I am not too interested in RFC5077's
ability to have one side (the TLS client) store the state, but
rather I am interested in a negotiation mechanism such that
both sides agree to break PFS.

Suggestions?

I am now leaning towards something like this; I am now leaning
towards MAY because no-one has said this feature is necessary
for equipment they envision in the field:

   R-REUSE, a system MAY describe how to cache state between
            SRTP sessions in order to reduce CPU processing for
            future calls.  Note that such caching destroys PFS.

   R-CACHING, if a system does implement R-REUSE, both peers
            MUST agree to such caching.

Thoughts?

I just submitted:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-rfc4474-concerns-00.txt

This is basically a discussion on the security properties of rfc4474 
with phone numbers, and a comparison to rfc3325 in this case. Also a 
discussion on what happens to dtls-srtp.

Comments welcome.

Hi,

Dan Wing and I wrote up a draft identifying a method for using RFC-4474 sig=
ned requests as "bait" for a SIP Phishing or SPIT attack.  Comments welcome=
, of course.

[JRE] Yes, but E.164 numbers are used extensively, and a big advantage
is that they can be reached from PSTN as well as being reachable from
within the SIP world. So it would make sense to be able to use E.164
numbers but also be able to draw the same conclusions about domain as
one can for "real" SIP URIs.

[JRE] That was my intention - with user=phone.

[JRE] This brings us firmly back to the concept of ownership of E.164
numbers, since clearly if a recognised CA is going to sign a certificate
for such a domain, that domain would need to demonstrate some kind of
ownership. I gather in North America this would fit well with the idea
that enterprises "own" their E.164 numbers (I am referring here to a
comment from Henry), and if this is true elsewhere it might be a
realistic proposition. I do like your suggestion.

Jonathan,

I guess the time has come for this discussion, since John Ewell has also 
submitted a draft on this subject.

I thought the problem was already well known, but perhaps not. IMO the 
main thing now is to figure out the *solution* to the problem!
IMO a solution is to use a 4474-style approach, but where the 
certificate is tied to just the phone number, not to some arbitrary 
domain name. That of course would depend on a model where the "owner" of 
the phone number is the one who may obtain the certificate for that number.

My thought is that we already have an algorithmic mapping from an E.164 
phone number to a domain name, defined by enum. If the sender puts an 
E.164 number in From, and can sign it with a cert for the enum mapped 
domain name corresponding to that number, then that ought to be valid 
proof of the validity of the sender.

In those places where public enum is in operation, I think there is 
already a legal mechanism in place to give the owner of record of a 
particular phone number control over the contents of the corresponding 
DNS entry. That should also be sufficient to allow a certificate 
authority to assign a cert to that same owner.

Combine all that and you have a complete e2e identity model for phone 
numbers, based on public enum. And that can be true even if public enum 
isn't used to *route* the calls to that number. So it could be used for 
"unlisted" numbers.

To use this approach the From header should contain either a TEL URI, or 
a sip/sips URI containing the enum-mapped domain name corresponding to 
the phone number. (I would rather see the TEL used for this - it is more 
user friendly.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi Gonzalo,

I have been going through draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-01 and noticed
something that is either en error or counter-intuitive.

Section 5.1 states:
   The body parts are
   ordered so that the last one is the richest representation of the
   information.  This way, the recipient of a 'multipart/alternative'
   body chooses the last body part it understands.

Section 6.2 states:
   If the handling of a 'multipart/alternative' body is required, the UA
   MUST set the 'handling' parameter of the 'multipart/alternative' body
   to 'required'.  The UA MUST also set the 'handling' parameter of the
   last body part within the 'multipart/alternative' to 'required'.

Why the last body part? Somehow, I would have expected that the
'handling' parameter of first body part to be set to 'required', not the
last one, as the last one should hold the richest representation of the
information, and possibly the one most difficult to
understand/implement...

And thinking about it a little bit more, I think that an application
should always set the 'handling' parameter in the internal parts of a
'multipart/alternative' to 'optional', as this is pretty much what
'multipart/alternative' is. If 'multipart/alternative' itself is has its
'handling' set to 'required', then it means at least one of its internal
part must be understood and handled. The sender cannot really decide
which one has to be understood.

Maybe my suggestion is going against things already defined in MIME or
somewhere else. If this is the case, I think a simple clarification in
the draft would do, something in the line:

Even though the last part of the 'multipart/alternative' has its
'handling' parameter set to 'required', the receiving UA (or UAS) does
not necessarly have to be able to handle this specific body part, it
only has to be able to handle any body part within the
'multipart/alternative' body parts.

Best Regards,

EricT

This seems indeed to be cutting the Gordian Knot!
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot)

Should this not be a joint I-D with the ENUM WG, or have at least have
some coordination?
The exact mechanism to do this is certainly of interest to the ENUM
folks.

Jonathan,

I guess the time has come for this discussion, since John Ewell has also

submitted a draft on this subject.

I thought the problem was already well known, but perhaps not. IMO the 
main thing now is to figure out the *solution* to the problem!
IMO a solution is to use a 4474-style approach, but where the 
certificate is tied to just the phone number, not to some arbitrary 
domain name. That of course would depend on a model where the "owner" of

the phone number is the one who may obtain the certificate for that
number.

My thought is that we already have an algorithmic mapping from an E.164 
phone number to a domain name, defined by enum. If the sender puts an 
E.164 number in From, and can sign it with a cert for the enum mapped 
domain name corresponding to that number, then that ought to be valid 
proof of the validity of the sender.

In those places where public enum is in operation, I think there is 
already a legal mechanism in place to give the owner of record of a 
particular phone number control over the contents of the corresponding 
DNS entry. That should also be sufficient to allow a certificate 
authority to assign a cert to that same owner.

Combine all that and you have a complete e2e identity model for phone 
numbers, based on public enum. And that can be true even if public enum 
isn't used to *route* the calls to that number. So it could be used for 
"unlisted" numbers.

To use this approach the From header should contain either a TEL URI, or

a sip/sips URI containing the enum-mapped domain name corresponding to 
the phone number. (I would rather see the TEL used for this - it is more

user friendly.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

I have been pestering various people off list, and have decided to see 
whether someone else understands and can explain this in a way I can 
follow.  The following is somewhat longer than I like.  Sorry.

The pair of questions is:
When should the user part of a SIP URI be considered an E.164 number?
And what assertion is being made by such consideration?

Taking them backwards, as far as I can tell from reading the RFCs and 
the I-Ds, the assertion that is supposed to hold is that if a SIP URI 
can be properly understood to have an E.164 number in it's user part, 
and if it legitimately has that number, then the party the SIP URI 
represents can also be reached by calling the E.164 number on the PSTN.

There are some interesting ambiguities left even with that definition, 
but we can live with it.

So, when does the user part have an E.164 number, so that it is 
reasonable to ask if the assertion holds?
As far as I can tell, there are three cases:

Case 1 - No ;user=phone option
In the absence of a ;user=phone option, the user part of the SIP URI 
should be considered an opaque string.  It should not be considered an 
E.164 number, even if it is formatted as a telephone subscriber number. 
  I can legitimately use +17035555555@joelhalpern.com as a SIP URI.  And 
if the whitehouse.com deliberate confusion is still active, they could 
use +12024561414@whitehouse.com as a SIP URI.
It is reported that some SIP devices will display the phone number 
without the domain for such URIs.  That is a UI error, not a protocol 
error.  The protocol can not make the UI do the right thing.

Case 2 - ;user=phone option present, no ;phone-context= option
I believe this is an assertion that the user part of the SIP URI is an 
E.164 number, and that if one is doing validation E.164 validation is 
appropriate.  The whole question of the meaning of the domain, and 
whether we are better off with tel: URIs applies to this form of SIP URI.
While it is possible (any character string is possible) to have a SIP 
URI with ;user=phone and no ;phone-context and not have the user part 
formatted as a telephone-subscriber number, such a mismatch looks to me 
to be a violation of RFC 3261.  The only reasonable handling is that if 
one is trying to perform E.164 validation, such validation will fail on 
such a SIP URI.

Case 3 - ;user=phone and ;phone-context= options present
The RFCs seem to say explicitly that the user part of the SIP URI can 
not be considered an E.164 number, and that one can not even expect to 
concatenate the phone context and the user part to get an E.164 number. 
  So there can be no E.164 validation because there is no E.164 number.


Some folks seem to have suggested that one should observe the format of 
the user part of the SIP URI in order to decide if an E.164 number is 
intended.  I sincerely hope that is note the case.

Yours,
Joel M. Halpern

I'm a little confused by the need to "sign" phone numbers.  I mean, whomever
uses the number makes a call to or from it right?  If the receiver of the
call doesn't want to talk to whomever calls, don't they just hang up?  This
seems like a lot of extra work for little gain.

Thanks,
FM

This seems indeed to be cutting the Gordian Knot!
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot)

Should this not be a joint I-D with the ENUM WG, or have at least have
some coordination?
The exact mechanism to do this is certainly of interest to the ENUM
folks.

Jonathan,

I guess the time has come for this discussion, since John Ewell has also

submitted a draft on this subject.

I thought the problem was already well known, but perhaps not. IMO the 
main thing now is to figure out the *solution* to the problem!
IMO a solution is to use a 4474-style approach, but where the 
certificate is tied to just the phone number, not to some arbitrary 
domain name. That of course would depend on a model where the "owner" of

the phone number is the one who may obtain the certificate for that
number.

My thought is that we already have an algorithmic mapping from an E.164 
phone number to a domain name, defined by enum. If the sender puts an 
E.164 number in From, and can sign it with a cert for the enum mapped 
domain name corresponding to that number, then that ought to be valid 
proof of the validity of the sender.

In those places where public enum is in operation, I think there is 
already a legal mechanism in place to give the owner of record of a 
particular phone number control over the contents of the corresponding 
DNS entry. That should also be sufficient to allow a certificate 
authority to assign a cert to that same owner.

Combine all that and you have a complete e2e identity model for phone 
numbers, based on public enum. And that can be true even if public enum 
isn't used to *route* the calls to that number. So it could be used for 
"unlisted" numbers.

To use this approach the From header should contain either a TEL URI, or

a sip/sips URI containing the enum-mapped domain name corresponding to 
the phone number. (I would rather see the TEL used for this - it is more

user friendly.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

You might take a look at "Identity Based Authentication in the Session  
Initiation Protocol",  draft-kupwade-sip-iba-00.

This draft is a bit incomplete, but it's the reduction of a far longer  
master's thesis that I'm familiar with.

It seems reasonably feasible to consider the phone number an  
"identity" within the domain of an identity-based private key  
generator.  The math is now available to handle multiple levels of PKG  
hierarchy, which allows key-generation delegation along the ENUM tree  
lines. On an operational basis, it seems a lot easier to work with  
than a CA model.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Using Extended Key Usage (EKU) for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) X.509 Certificates
	Author(s)       : S. Lawrence, V. Gurbani
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-eku-01.txt
	Pages           : 10
	Date            : 2008-02-18

This memo documents an extended key usage (EKU) X.509 certificate
extension for identifying the holder of a certificate as
authoritative for a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) service in the
domain named by the DNS name in the certificate.

I think we're trying to get something out of the signature that currently isn't fully there: caller-id.  Currently rfc4474 just tells you that the signer sent the request to someone (not necessarily you), within the past hour, with the attached body unchanged between it and you.  Per rfc4474 that signer should have verified the authenticity of the AoR in the From before sending it.

If the signing domain didn't do strong verification of the From before signing an email-style URI, the impact of such is really against the signing domain.  In other words its in the signing domain's best interest to get it right, because it's affecting their own customers' identity legitimacy.  But when a signing domain signs an e164 that is not its own, it's affecting a global number's legitimacy - its spoofing the identity of someone outside of the signing domain.  Without some way to verify the signing domain *owns* that e164, you have no way to know if it's good or not.

For example, if a provider gets a call from a PSTN tandem trunk, and passes it on in SIP, they really shouldn't sign its From, because they have no way to verify the authenticity of its user part. (CLID spoofing is not a new phenomenon)  And likewise if an enterprise signs an e164 other than their own, it would be an error.  But there is currently no way to detect such errors or intentional mischief.

Intesting point.  But again, I'll ask the question.  So what?  If the call
goes to or come from somewhere that's unintended, one or the other party
just hangs up (I do it all the time when the telemarketers call  ;)  ).  Why
do we need all this infrastructure if a simple operational usage solves this
problem well enough?

Thanks,
FM

How do they know who called? Can the thing being presented as caller- 
ID be trusted?

Example use case:

You get a call from "Memorial Hospital" at 999-454-5678. Your child  
was apparently injured at school and is claimed to be in ICU, but your  
signature is urgently needed before a life-saving procedure can be  
administered. You double-check by calling back 999-454-5678 and get  
the front desk at Memorial Hospital. Just to be sure, you look in the  
phone book, and yep, that's their number. Of course, you rush to the  
hospital.

While you're out, the burglar who faked the call cleans out your house.

Or even more fun: Your neighbors are having a really noisy party. Call  
911, faking their phone number as the source, and report a murder-in- 
progress. Stand by and wait for the SWAT team to show up.

-09 was submitted on Feb 8 and it included the comments
raised during WGLC review and subsequent list discussion.

Yes.  Needs WG review.

Just submitted an updated -01 for sip-eku.  Needs WG review,
probably along with PKIX's as well.

Thanks, Dean.

How do they know who called? Can the thing being presented as caller- 
ID be trusted?

Example use case:

You get a call from "Memorial Hospital" at 999-454-5678. Your child  
was apparently injured at school and is claimed to be in ICU, but your  
signature is urgently needed before a life-saving procedure can be  
administered. You double-check by calling back 999-454-5678 and get  
the front desk at Memorial Hospital. Just to be sure, you look in the  
phone book, and yep, that's their number. Of course, you rush to the  
hospital.

FM: Call me crazy but I get weird caller-ids on my phones all the time now,
with the trusted PSTN.  You don't think that people won't figure out how to
circumvent what we do if they really want to?


While you're out, the burglar who faked the call cleans out your house.

Or even more fun: Your neighbors are having a really noisy party. Call  
911, faking their phone number as the source, and report a murder-in- 
progress. Stand by and wait for the SWAT team to show up.


FM: Any reasonable person would call the hospital back first before rushing
out.  Besides, this same trick can be done now with Private or Blocked in
the PSTN.

Two reasons off the top of my head: SPIT and Phishing.

Phishing: how do you know who the caller is?  If a call comes in claiming your Bank's phone number, or the local Police, or whatever, would you hang up?  How would you know to?  You probably would be suspicious, being a technically savvy individual, but plenty of people click on the false PayPal links in email.  My wife did, for example, and needless to say two hours later the credit card company called saying there had been suspicious charges. (at which point I asked her how did she know it was the credit card company!)  If the Caller-id was at least verifiable, there'd be recourse for law enforcement to find the caller.

SPIT: Your phone rang, you answered, and then learned it was a telemarketer.  They succeeded.  You hung up, but many don't.  A "telemarketer" call actually isn't SPIT in my book, if they use a legitimate CLID. (for some people it still is though)  But if they can just pick random E.164's as CLIDs, SIP will turn into email, and that ain't good.  I don't want my phone to ring constantly.  Current email form of spam detection doesn't make sense for VoIP.  IF we can get a verifiable caller-id, then there's a chance of stopping it with blacklists/whitelists or reputation systems or whatever. (I think that task is rather daunting in itself, but that's the premise anyway)

Frank,

So are you asserting that reliable callerid is not needed, or that it is 
not possible?

If its not needed, then I guess sip identity was a waste of time, as is 
P-Asserted-ID. From should be good enough.

The PSTN callerid is to a large extend based on transitive trust, and is 
reliable if the providers are careful. It breaks when providers trust 
sources that they shouldn't. Apparently that is becoming an increasingly 
common case.

If we create a cert-based mechanism similar to 4474 that works for phone 
numbers then there should be no way around it other than stealing the 
certs. So it should be better than the PSTN.

	Paul

Subject: Re: [Sip] New I-D on RFC4474 and phone numbers

Two reasons off the top of my head: SPIT and Phishing.

Phishing: how do you know who the caller is?  If a call comes in claiming
your Bank's phone number, or the local Police, or whatever, would you hang
up?  How would you know to?  You probably would be suspicious, being a
technically savvy individual, but plenty of people click on the false PayPal
links in email.  My wife did, for example, and needless to say two hours
later the credit card company called saying there had been suspicious
charges. (at which point I asked her how did she know it was the credit card
company!)  If the Caller-id was at least verifiable, there'd be recourse for
law enforcement to find the caller.


FM: I don't think we can equate email Phishing with Phishing in the phone
system.  There are two reasons.  First, email is just a lot easier to do
this with.  I don't mean its easier because its easier to disguise your
identity with email.  I mean its easier because it takes less effort
economically to actual fire off a million emails than it does to make a
million phone calls, even with automated systems.  Second, Phishing exists
in the PSTN now.  Yes it's a problem but, if we can't stop it there, what
makes you think we'll be able to stop it here.  While we can do lots of
fancy (and expensive) things to protect ourselves in the IP world, the
counterbalance is that hacking IP based systems is a lot easier than hacking
the PSTN.  The best thing to do is to tell your wife and kids what I've told
mine, never, ever, ever click on a link that you're not absolutely sure
where it came from or who it is.  Unsolicited emails don't fall into that
category.


SPIT: Your phone rang, you answered, and then learned it was a telemarketer.
They succeeded.  You hung up, but many don't.  A "telemarketer" call
actually isn't SPIT in my book, if they use a legitimate CLID. (for some
people it still is though)  But if they can just pick random E.164's as
CLIDs, SIP will turn into email, and that ain't good.  I don't want my phone
to ring constantly.  Current email form of spam detection doesn't make sense
for VoIP.  IF we can get a verifiable caller-id, then there's a chance of
stopping it with blacklists/whitelists or reputation systems or whatever. (I
think that task is rather daunting in itself, but that's the premise anyway)


FM: I'd luv to be able to do this but...   What do you do when a number
comes in that is just a number, i.e. it doesn't have a "caller id"
associated with it?  That happens all the time to me and would probably
happen all the time for IP systems as well.  It may be signed but so what?
You may not know where that number is, but what do you do?  Most people just
answer it.  If its SPIT, you hangup.  Why is that so hard?  If we're going
to stay with the anachronism of phone numbers, why can't we just stay with
the remedies that have been developed for it, Do-Not-Call lists and laws
governing telemarketers and legal action against them and such.  Those are
the things that modify the behavior of humans ultimately, not our
technology.

Frank,

So are you asserting that reliable callerid is not needed, or that it is 
not possible?

FM: Not possible enough to justify the expense.


If its not needed, then I guess sip identity was a waste of time, as is 
P-Asserted-ID. From should be good enough.

FM: Well, waste of time would not be the exact words I would use...  ;)



The PSTN callerid is to a large extend based on transitive trust, and is 
reliable if the providers are careful. It breaks when providers trust 
sources that they shouldn't. Apparently that is becoming an increasingly 
common case.

FM:  Yes and no.  Its definitely based on trust that we don't assume in IP
based systems.  And its still relatively easy to get around.


If we create a cert-based mechanism similar to 4474 that works for phone 
numbers then there should be no way around it other than stealing the 
certs. So it should be better than the PSTN.



FM: Look, I'm sure this community is going to probably go off and spend a
lot of time doing this.  And there may ultimately be large, expensive
deployments of certs and signatures, etc. etc.  Just don't kid yourself that
its going to stop phishing or spit cuz it won't

I agree that something along the lines of enum could solve this problem, 
and I believe there was a draft that proposed such a thing. This has 
been discussed since the start of rfc4474.

However, I fear that saying, 'use enum' is kind of like saying, we'll 
just use an All-Knowing Oracle, so lets figure out the interface 
protocol to the Oracle. The easy part is the interface (the enum 
mechanism). The actual hard problem is how to get those entries 
populated. The deployment of public enum has been - shall we say - less 
than spectacular. I'd hate for that to be our only solution. Not that 
its obvious what else to do; though I do suggest in my draft how domain

I don't think it is very clear anywhere in our current RFCs, that the 
presence of a +<number> in the user part, along with user=phone, 
actually implies that the user is reachable by that e164 directly. 
Overall this remains a messy area for us.

I took a stab at trying to sort some of it out in an I-D I published a 
while back:

http://www.watersprings.org/pub/id/draft-rosenberg-rai-phone-names-numbers-00.txt

and John's draft discusses similar issues.

Hi Jonathan, =

Hi Paul,

thanks for raising the aspect of E.164 and ENUM usage. There was an offline=
 discussion between Dan Wing, Klaus Darilion, Kai Fischer, David Schwartz, =
Hadriel Kaplan, John Elwell, and myself about E.164 and SIP Identity. As pa=
rt of the discussion Klaus and I polished a former document of Alexander Ma=
yrhofer on the usage of ENUM for E.164 numbers (see draft-mayrhofer-enum-do=
mainkeys-00). As we moved along with the work we obviously came across a co=
uple of problems (as one can easily imagine) and the document triggered a l=
ong discussion among us. Dispite a couple of challenges, we published the d=
ocument today (see http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-darilion-sip-e=
164-enum-00.txt). I learned a lot while working on that document. =


In addition to publishing the document a few of us have also worked on a do=
cument that captures some of our discussion on E.164 number ownership. I wi=
ll publish it very soon -- just a bit more proof-reading. =


Ciao
Hannes =

Yes, there is no debate that cost/expense and closed networks have kept phone calls from being hammered like email.  Unfortunately/fortunately, that cost is dropping.  This topic isn't about today - it's about 5-20+ years from now.  If the call cost drops at the current rate, and if enough SIP providers peer with each other and/or it opens up more, then we'll have a problem.  For me, it's particularly the peering problem that concerns me. (for obvious reasons)

That's a lot of "ifs", but really the IETF's time has been spent on protocols and methods with far less chance of success or potential need.  ;)

With regard to performance, we already have a tool which can generate 1 Million call attempts, each to different targets, each with random From's, in approximately 5 seconds.  This tool is purely software running on MS Windows.  It can do it (and has) running on my laptop, which has a GigE interface.  The tool can send pre-recorded RTP media to as many destinations as 200K packets/sec can cover for the codec rate and ptime.  It's not able to complete dialogs, or make full calls, and trying to do so would reduce it immensely I'm sure.  But it would only have to do that for the calls that answer.

The only thing that stops such a thing from succeeding other than cost is that the SIP infrastructure can't deal with that kind of rate, so certain devices at provider borders are built to stop it.  But as the performance of the provider equipment increases, or more entry points are available, it's the per-call cost (or bulk cost) that will prevent it, and once that's down enough we could be in trouble without some form of strong identity.

Then you know not to show a caller-id, and it is suspect.  In other words the signing de-values those that aren't signed.

Do-not-call-lists and legal action are only possible if the source is verifiable, no?  Calls originate and transit through providers outside of the local nationality, too.  The "if it's SPIT you hang up" model doesn't work if the rate of SPIT is even a fraction of email's spam.  You wouldn't put up with it, or at least most people wouldn't.

As part of an off-line discussion regarding Kai Fischer's draft on e2e-security-media and whether his From-URI copying tactic would succeed or not at a policy level, if rfc4474 fails to do so, I gave my 2 cents on what some providers had been telling me.  Dan asked me to write up a draft on it, in case people are interested.  This is the draft:

Dean,

I took a look but didn't spend a lot of time. I can't understand it 
enough to figure out how it might apply.

To me the basic points are that enum provides the basis for a *legal* 
definition of ownership of numbers, which could be tied to a CA scheme. 
Enum also provides a mapping from numbers to domain names, which 
provides a direct way to map to DNS-based certs.

If this new scheme can be related to e.164 numbers then maybe it can 
apply as well. One thing I don't understand is how it would tie to a 
legal definition of ownership of the numbers.

The question about whether it "legitimately has that number" is troublesome.

And whether the person can be reached via the PSTN is also questionable. 
For instance, suppose you received a call with only MSRP as media from 
such an address, and tried to return the call. If you used MSRP they it 
would almost certainly fail. (Unless there was an MSRP - SMS GW.) If you 
used voice it might still fail if the owner has no voice terminal 
registered.

I agree with you. But common practice is otherwise.

I always interpreted this as meaning that the *syntax* of the user part 
conformed to the TEL URI. IMO it is much less clear that you have any 
guarantee that this identifies the same place you would reach if you 
made a PSTN call.

Yes, syntax wise I agree.

Yes, I agree. This is more a question about TEL URIs in general than 
about sip URIs. IMO there is opportunity for further standardization of 
how to generate routing to TEL URIs with phone-context parameters. But 
that is for the future.

Yes, I agree. IMO we have no business reserving that whole subset of the 
username space.

However there is a sticky point. Registration is done without regard for 
parameters in the user part of the AOR, and translations based on the 
location service also ignore the parameters. So its impossible for a 
domain to have both:

	sip:+12024561414@whitehouse.com;user=phone
	sip:+12024561414@whitehouse.com

as distinct AORs. In practice that reserves the whole e.164 space in 
domains that want to honor e.164 numbers.

I agree that the problem exists. But in the end for any signing based on 
number to work there must be a tie to the legal notion of ownership of 
e.164 numbers. There is no getting around that. Its just a matter of 
whether there is *one* system for tying to ownership, or two.

In this case it doesn't require that dns entries in the e164.ansi tree 
be populated. Rather it requires that some CAs support the legal 
framework for assigning certs, based on the same definitions of ownership.

It isn't essential that the certs be distributed to the end users owning 
the numbers. A SP could act as an agent for the user in managing the 
cert and doing the signing. (But an end user who wants to sign his own 
requests should be able to get the cert.)

"less than spectacular .." now there is an understatement, if there ever was
one. Though private non DNS visible enum systems are going like gangbusters
as TCAP/SS7 replacements all over the place.

I find this entire discussion somewhat hilarious, almost side splitting,
considering what some us had to go through to get A. get public ENUM defined
B. then see what happened with delegations in the e164.arpa domain in the
intervening 6 years or so. 

The very idea that there is going to be some consensus on who "owns" a phone
number, much less a deployable system considering the various competing
interests here is a complete fantasy.  



I'd hate for that to be our only solution. Not that

Actually, I'm not even sure it really requires that.  It is debatable if you truly own your number, and certainly debatable if CA roots would be willing to sign off on certs that are given to direct end users if the SP acts as an agent middle-man. (that basically breaks their vetting process, no?)  On the other hand, if you'll allow solely for the UAC's and UAS's local providers/enterprise's to do the authentication *and* verification, and give up on the UAS being able to verify directly, then it may be more palatable and potentially succeed.

For example, if you are willing to ignore DNS' lack of security (assuming there is no dnssec), then all you really need is a DNS root to get ownership domain names from for the numbers, rather than certs per number or entry.  In other words let enum return the naptr identifying the owner's domain name, rather than a next-hop route resolution or certificate directly.  Then just check that the 4474-provided cert matches that name.  Obviously if DNS is subverted, or the DNS request intercepted or response spoofed, it breaks.  But it's a lot lighter weight and manageable than putting a cert per number into the DNS.  Heck, even using dnssec it would probably be lighter weight.

Whether providers would be willing to put that ownership info into a public dns tree I don't know.  But they might be willing to in a non-public tree only other providers could use. (since that info is essentially already available in SS7)  Or even exchange that info with each other.  I believe that is one possible logical outcome of Peppermint, for example.

Nice draft.

One thing this highlights is that even if we solve the identity problem 
for E.164 numbers in sip-sip cases, the identity problem will remain for 
the pstn-sip case.

The solutions for the sip-sip case will presumably require that somebody 
actually *know* the sender is the owner of the number. The GW in a 
pstn-sip call will in general not know that. In reality the callerid in 
pstn calls cannot be trusted, so a true assertion of it cannot be done 
with a pstn source. Yet from a practical perspective most will consider 
a pstn assertion of identity to be something they want to know about.

That suggests to me that a weaker form of assertion is needed in that 
case, and that for suitably smart phones different forms of callerid 
presentation be used in those cases, reflecting the degree of confidence 
in the value being presented.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Definitely.  If the user part even smells like an e164, it's treated as one by a lot of folks. :(

Really ???  Transitive trust seems to have worked reasonable well for the
time being   .what examples have you found of sources that providers thought
they could trust but found they shouldn't have?

Well just as a small side bar here ... by International Treaty ...yes our
friends in Geneva, no one "owns" phone numbers. The governance of E.164
phone numbers are strictly nation state matters. So anything that touches
the namespace gets to be vetted by each and every country. See the IAB-ITU
agreements on e164.arpa for instance.

You are starting from a fallacy aka "ownership" already and fast going
downhill. "Right to usage" is even more a slippery slope...been there done
that.  :-)

IMO its up to the owner of the UA and his SP whether the UA has the cert 
and does the signing, or the SP acts as an agent for the UA, holding the 
cert and doing the signing. While I would like it to be possible for a 
user to do this himself, most probably won't want to, and most providers 
won't want to let them. While sad, it would probably be good enough if I 
had to go looking for a provider that would let me manage my own cert.

Similarly, on the verification side I can see how many UASs would prefer 
to have a SP do the hard verification and just relay the results on via 
a P-A-ID header. It would however be good if a UAS *could* do the 
verification itself - which means that the public key must be accessible 
to it in some way.

IMO the part that gives me the most worry is if there is reluctance to 
*define* ownership. But I don't think I believe that is a real problem. 
I will bet that if somebody shows up with a warrant demanding the 
disclosure of the owner of some phone number, the SP will be willing and 
able to provide an answer, and defend it in court.

I presume the real reluctance is to *disclose* the ownership to anyone 
who asks, for both business and legal reasons. But if its not the 
identity, but simply the public key or cert that is disclosed, then I 
would hope it would be hard to justify keeping it private. But perhaps 
that is just wishful thinking on my part.

It is debatable if you truly own your number, and certainly debatable if CA roots would be willing to sign off on certs that are given to direct end users if the SP acts as an agent middle-man. (that basically breaks their vetting process, no?)  On the other hand, if you'll allow solely for the UAC's and UAS's local providers/enterprise's to do the authentication *and* verification, and give up on the UAS being able to verify directly, then it may be more palatable and potentially succeed.

In other words let enum return the naptr identifying the owner's domain name, rather than a next-hop route resolution or certificate directly.  Then just check that the 4474-provided cert matches that name.  Obviously if DNS is subverted, or the DNS request intercepted or response spoofed, it breaks.  But it's a lot lighter weight and manageable than putting a cert per number into the DNS.  Heck, even using dnssec it would probably be lighter weight.

(since that info is essentially already available in SS7)  Or even exchange that info with each other.  I believe that is one possible logical outcome of Peppermint, for example.

In your experience would there be a quorum of incumbent providers who would be willing to publish their numbers in an infrastructure enum, available only to other "club members"?  Such a thing is essentially the logical conclusion of Peppermint, isn't it?  Just in a distributed form.

I haven't been involved in the space like you have. I realize that 
"ownership" iss probably too strong a word. Pick whatever word you like. 
Some entity is entitled to have a phone associated with a particular 
number, and other entities are not entitled to have phones associated 
with that same number. Whatever you want to call that is ok with me.

When the feds show up with the warrant, what does the SP tell them? That 
is what defines it.

In those places where public enum is supported, some entity is entitled 
to give instructions on how it shall be populated for a given number. 
What do you call that entity?

	Thanks,
	Paul

It takes far more time to listen than deleting an email and is far more
annoying than email spam. IMO the efforts proposed here are fully
justified, though it will not be easy to accomplish.

One of the main reasons for giving up PSTN service may be to just get
relief from telemarketing calls.

Subject: RE: [Sip] New I-D on RFC4474 and phone numbers



I'm a little confused by the need to "sign" phone numbers.  I mean,
whomever
uses the number makes a call to or from it right?  If the receiver of
the
call doesn't want to talk to whomever calls, don't they just hang up?
This
seems like a lot of extra work for little gain.

Thanks,
FM

This seems indeed to be cutting the Gordian Knot!
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot)

Should this not be a joint I-D with the ENUM WG, or have at least have
some coordination?
The exact mechanism to do this is certainly of interest to the ENUM
folks.

Jonathan,

I guess the time has come for this discussion, since John Ewell has also

submitted a draft on this subject.

I thought the problem was already well known, but perhaps not. IMO the 
main thing now is to figure out the *solution* to the problem!
IMO a solution is to use a 4474-style approach, but where the 
certificate is tied to just the phone number, not to some arbitrary 
domain name. That of course would depend on a model where the "owner" of

the phone number is the one who may obtain the certificate for that
number.

My thought is that we already have an algorithmic mapping from an E.164 
phone number to a domain name, defined by enum. If the sender puts an 
E.164 number in From, and can sign it with a cert for the enum mapped 
domain name corresponding to that number, then that ought to be valid 
proof of the validity of the sender.

In those places where public enum is in operation, I think there is 
already a legal mechanism in place to give the owner of record of a 
particular phone number control over the contents of the corresponding 
DNS entry. That should also be sufficient to allow a certificate 
authority to assign a cert to that same owner.

Combine all that and you have a complete e2e identity model for phone 
numbers, based on public enum. And that can be true even if public enum 
isn't used to *route* the calls to that number. So it could be used for 
"unlisted" numbers.

To use this approach the From header should contain either a TEL URI, or

a sip/sips URI containing the enum-mapped domain name corresponding to 
the phone number. (I would rather see the TEL used for this - it is more

user friendly.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

That is the problem .. first you have the service provider of record that
actually issued the number under the authority of a nation state then the
entity that actually uses that number (consumer or enterprise) all of this
is complicated by the issue of Local Number Portability, of course and
lastly the fact that the number could be used by multiple applications,
delivered by different application service providers etc.

Ah if it were only that simple :-) 

Well that's when you get into the real fun of the fact that numbers could be
issued by a wholesale service provider to a downstream application provider
so the carrier of record in many nation states is not the entity providing
the service ..aka Vonage and Level3 for instance. This is a problem that is
vexing our friends in the LEA's even as we speak. The numbering databases do
not completely reflect the reality of service deployments.

Short answer NO but that is IMHO. Not in a global DNS tree, it's too fraught
with real politics and I mean REAL politics.

It not entirely clear the pain threshold has been reached on the overriding
identity problem you all are addressing and yes the ITU is definitely
looking at the issue. 

PEPPERMINT is not about the provisioning of public, infrastructure (carrier
of record) or private ENUM trees. It could easily encompass bilateral or
multilateral arrangements or PBX to SP data exchanges.

PEPPERMINT does not presume any business model for the exchange of data (
which certainly could include a cert tree ) only a standard methodology for
the exchange of data itself. 

And yes you all are welcome to come to the 2nd PEPPERMINT BOF, alas beer
will not be served.

   Yes, there is no debate that cost/expense and closed networks have
   kept phone calls from being hammered like email.
   Unfortunately/fortunately, that cost is dropping.  This topic isn't
   about today - it's about 5-20+ years from now.

Of course, the entire economic driver of SIP adoption is the hope of
reducing the cost of phone calls ... to the point that SPIT would be
easy and inexpensive!

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP
	Author(s)       : M. Munakata, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-01.txt
	Pages           : 10
	Date            : 2008-02-18

To withhold a user's identity and related information, RFC 3323
defines a Privacy mechanism for SIP, which requires the use of an
privacy service.  This document proposes a new privacy mechanism that
a user agent can facilitate to conceal privacy-sensitive information
without the need for aid from a privacy service.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-01.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-01.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

   From: "Joel M. Halpern" <jmh@joelhalpern.com>

   The pair of questions is:
   When should the user part of a SIP URI be considered an E.164 number?
   And what assertion is being made by such consideration?

I would start by saying "the user part is never an E.164 number,
unless a particular domain uses it that way (and you have to route the
call to that domain for it to make that determination)".

I appear to be wrong, since RFC 3261 gives examples of SIP URIs with
user=phone and phone-context URI parameters.  But the best information
I can find is RFC 2848, and it appears that that RFC is about
identifying the user-part as a *dial string* to be interpreted within
the context of the dial plan at the specified SIP proxy.

Where is the normative description of when SIP user-parts are to be
interpreted as "phone numbers"?

That's on a different level of Dean;s 7-Layer Model -- the Political.


The simplest approach is that a top-level authority (say, ITU) operate  
a top-level PKG that then provides private keys to the national  
authorities, who then act as PKGs for lower-level delegations, and on  
down to the individual  phone number.

So, if you're in possession of a private key for your phone number,  
from the PKG that's authoritative for your phone number (according to  
whichever definition of that  authority we adopt), you are in  
possession of the identity indicated by that phone number.  Not all  
that different from enum, just a different algorithm for the key  
management and crypto.

That, treating anything that smells like an E.164 like an E.164, may 
well be common practice.
But it seems to me
a) it is a practice which is inherently misleading and error prone
b) it is a practice we can not sensibly design for / around.
c) It is not the working group's problem to repair security flaws 
introduced by such behavior.  It is the vendor's problem.

It works right now, because virtually all sip communication is E.164's, if the userpart is digits at all (and long enough, and following certain patterns).  In fact, I'd argue it works *better* than not doing it, for that reason.  Most of the time, maybe virtually ALL of the time, when there is no user=phone param, it's because a device screwed up not putting it there.
So you've got the incumbent/deployed boxes doing something that works.  If it ain't broke, no one is going to fix it.  Especially if fixing it breaks something already deployed.
(BTW, I'm talking about provider side - I don't know if this holds true in Enterprise SIP at all, given their funky dial plans, but my guess is for them it's a pattern match or external dial prefix match)


> b) it is a practice we can not sensibly design for / around.

I'm not sure we need to.  I didn't catch what the "problem" with this is with regard to E.164 assertions?  I mean let's pretend all of them have user=phone, and look just like a TEL username should or whatever.  What does that solve in terms of e164 identity?


> c) It is not the working group's problem to repair security flaws
> introduced by such behavior.  It is the vendor's problem.

And what exactly is the security flaw introduced?  You're not telling me that a user=phone parameter is somehow a security mechanism?  Is it like the evil bit or something?  ;)

Counterargument: If I call phone number X, and the responding party  
can complete a media-path handshake against the published key for that  
number, then I'd claim they "own" it. Possession is, after all,  
9/10ths of the law.

In other words, to heck with the government -- who answers the phone?

I agree with you there.  I'm thinking something slightly less global, like local in fact.

That's not how I meant it.  I meant, as it appears from the ESPP proposal, the idea is to exchange prefix and possibly unique number data reachability data.  It is not clear if it would encompass ported numbers too, or not.  Regardless, ESPP can't actually handle transit cases as written, but one possible outcome is that such data exchanged could let the providers learn the terminating provider domain, and thus if a call comes from it, what should have signed it. (sort of like uRPF in IP routing)  Doesn't matter anyway for now, just fantasizing. :)

I would think it should be schnapps... peppermint that is.  If you guys can't come up with a better name. (please!)

In fact, I'd argue it works *better* than not doing it, for that reason.  Most of the time, maybe virtually ALL of the time, when there is no user=phone param, it's because a device screwed up not putting it there.

What you are describing is a "do what I mean" system rather than a "do 
what I say" system.

With enough brute force you can make this work, by configuring 
everything to understand the conventions of all its neighbors. (And I 
know that is the typical deployment style used by my own employer's 
products.) It is better than nothing, but it is far from ideal.

It of course then enhances the belief that peering arrangements must be 
bilateral, because you need to negotiate the mapping of dial strings. 
(And if your business is managing these boundaries then this may be a 
good thing.)

But a system where everyone uses E.164 numbers, and where they *say* 
they are E.164 numbers, would simplify a lot of that.

I know of systems that assume a user part containing digits is a dial 
string. They don't quite "get it" that the dial string of one party may 
not be a vaid dial string for another party, or that even if it is it 
may denote a different destination. Is that a "problem"? I guess that 
depends.

Is this an appropriate thing to do? IMO no. But in a world where 
everybody decides for themselves what the user part of somebody else's 
phone number means, who is to say it is wrong?

All;

I have just submitted a new version of ua-privacy draft.
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-01.txt

Thanks to John Elwell for his comprehensive review,
we managed to make a lot of editorial corrections
and some technical.

One profound open issue we have is on how to get an
anonymous URI for a From header.  While we can use a
temp-gruu for a Contact header, there is no mechanism
to obtain a functional anonymous URI for the From
header or any other headers that houses URIs.

RFC3323 recommends to use "anonymous@anonymous.invalid"
for an anonymous URI in a From header.  However, this
impedes the use of SIP-Identity, as SIP-Identity
mandates the domain portion of the "From" URI and
that of "Identity-Info" to match.

One of the expired draft written by Jonathan, attempted
to use the GRUU to get this functional yet anonymous URI
to address this issue.
http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-rosenberg-sip-identity-privacy/

I can see few ways forward.

1. Suggest the use of anonymous@{user's domain name}, which
   verifier then can verify the signature's validity as
   domain portion of the URI and that of Identity-Info matches.
    >> If SIP-Identity is used, the domain is given away anyhow
       in the Identity-Info, so what is the point of hiding the
       domain in the From header?

2. Make a note that SIP-Identity will not function when
   anonymous@anonymous.invalid is used.
    >> Describe the caveat that verifier is likely to fail the
       request or suggest that Authentication Service does not
       add Identity-Info/signature.

3. Extend GRUU to support mechanism that Rosenberg suggested.

Does anybody has any preferences or any other suggestions?

Regards,
Mayumi

If the chairs could update everyone on the status -- we're 
waiting for requirements from 3GPP -- that should be enough

There is a discussion on the list regarding one requirement 
(R-REUSE), but so far only two of the co-authors of the document 
seem to be interested in discussing that requirement, so I guess 
it isn't much of a 'discussion'.  We'll take it off-list and 
assume everyone agrees.

There is the whole SIP Identity and E.164 problem which was brought
to light during Jason Fischl's DTLS presentation in Vancouver.  There
are at least eight new drafts posted related to SIP Identity and 
E.164:

  draft-darilion-sip-e164-enum-00.txt
  draft-elwell-sip-e164-problem-statement-00.txt
  draft-fischer-sip-e2e-sec-media-00.txt
  draft-kaplan-sip-baiting-attack-01.txt
  draft-kaplan-sip-uris-change-00.txt
  draft-rosenberg-sip-rfc4474-concerns-00.txt
  draft-schwartz-sip-e164-ownership-00.txt
  draft-wing-sip-e164-rrc-01.txt

So it seems there is interest in that topic, but a 10-20 minute
slot isn't enough time to say anything intelligent.

Hi Richard

I have thought about that. When I spoke to a couple of people about =

requesting a slot in ENUM they told me that ENUM is not the right place =

to discuss this.
Feedback from the ENUM WG would certainly be helpful. ;

Ciao

It sounds like a super big thing when someone talk about an "oracle". 
The DNS is in some sense such an oracle since it returns you an IP 
address when you give it the FQDN. Hence, we are talking about a 
distributed database in this case for providing E.164 ownership. It is, 
for sure, more complicated than other techniques (such as matching the 
content of certain fields in a certificate with fields in a protocol 
message) but if these simpler techniques don't  work what are you 
supposed todo?

Ciao
Hannes

That is what draft-wing-sip-e164-rrc-01 does, except it does it
over the signaling path.  The same thing could be done over the 
media path (using TOTE, even, if we like), if doing RRC over the
media path is deemed better/stronger/faster.

Nothing will stop phishing or spit.  Absolutely nothing.  Similar
attacks happen in the Real World with looks-like-real FedEx trucks
and Border Patrol vans,
http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/popup?id=4154733&contentIndex=1&page=6

What strong identity will do is create ... strong identity.  With
that, we can build useful and reliable whitelists.  We can build
useful and reliable reputation systems.  We can build a lot of
things.

Without strong identity, SIP will behave very much like everyone's
inbox.  Except, unlike email, you cannot filter SIP using content 
filtering (because there is no message) so popular and relatively
effective tools like Bayesian filters and SpamAssassin will not 
work for SIP.

So SIP needs effective and functional identity.

Nobody believes identity, by itself, will stop spit or phishing.  
However, identity is necessary to build anything else of value.

The PSTN's assertion of identity using CLID (which is the PSTN's
user-asserted identity) is as valuable as SIP's "From:" (which is 
SIP's user-asserted identity).

The PSTN's assertion of identity using ANI (which is the PSTN's
network-asserted identity) is as valuable as SIP's 
"P-Asserted-Identity:" (which is SIP's network-asserted 
identity).

A PSTN->SIP gateway would not want to, and MUST NOT, attempt to
provide a stronger assertion of identity because the PSTN itself
has very a weak identity model (transitive trust).

companies that appear to provide caller ID spoofing for a fee.  Of course,
providers don't care much about Caller ID spoofing as that only fools
subscribers.

So, to your question:  providers do care about the ANI, which is used by their
own systems.  I will leave you to search the Internet to see if there are
companies and products that proport to sell or provide ANI spoofing.  I found
1 product and 3 service companies on the first page of my Google search.

Hi All,

Is supported and require methods are required for INVITE request (RFC 3262)
or any of method(either Supported or require) will suffice for INVITE for
Provisional ACK. Because I see in one of INVITE(from server) sending only
require: 100Rel, but there is no Supported Header.

Should we treat as complete or incomplete request?

Any response is highly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance
Sudhir

Yes, but I should have been clearer - I'm not advocating we try to standardize it or some such.  It just is the reality.  So we can just continue assuming user=phone and such make it an e164, for the purpose of the identity mechanism for e614 (whatever the mechanism is).  Those who treat other things as e164 will just apply the same rules to them.  We may just need a "I signed this as e164" flag if the identity mechanism is different than for non-e164, or some such concept.

Actually, that is very much NOT in the best interest of those managing such things.  Any configuration whatsoever slows down peering bring-up time, and that does not help sell more border boxes.  It is in the best interest of border-box vendors to make it as plug-play/standard as possible.  (and I don't think peering is bilateral because of dial-string formats, but that's getting off-topic)

Yeah, no disagreement there.

Hi Sudhir,
  "Supported" and "Require" are known as headers rather than methods.
  These two headers have the following significance as per RFC 3261 :
  =20
20.32 Require
The Require header field is used by UACs to tell UASs about options
   that the UAC expects the UAS to support in order to process the
   request.
=20
20.37 Supported
   The Supported header field enumerates all the extensions supported by
   the UAC or UAS.

  If INVITE contains just "Supported" header, the UAS "MAY" send the
non-100 responses reliably as stated in RFC 3262
=20
  If INVITE contains "Require" header, the UAS "MUST" send the non-100
responses reliably. If it does not support this extension, it should
respond to the INVITE with "420 Bad Extension" response.
=20
  Its valid for a UAC to send INVITE with just "Require: 100 rel" header
as well.
Best Regards,
Rekha

Well ENUM is on a short leash in Philadelphia with only 1 hour, we are
trying to slowly but deliberately wind things down. It might not be the best
time, but we certainly have large body of expertise in dealing with E.164
numbers and the history of trying to deal with number mappings in globally
distributed databases. :-) =


It's certainly something worth discussing the ENUM WG list from time to time
but the real issues are all layer 8 and above.

I wish I knew. But I do know Patrik Faltstrom, I and the IAB-IESG have no
stomach for sitting around the ITU in Geneva for the next 5-7 years trying
to get them to buy into a solution involving another apex involving e164
numbers. 

We are still trying to resolve the issue regarding the concept of
Infrastructure ENUM ( which could involve certs BTW) and the associated
drafts we produced in the last couple of years.  We have been told that the
IAB is trying to finalize the liaison letter to ITU SG2 on that issue as we
speak.

You might recall Patrik and I sent a Memorandum on this very issue of
Infrastructure ENUM and related issues involving e164 numbers to the
IAB-IESG some time ago.

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/enum/current/msg05529.html

If there is going to be a solution to the SIP identity problem involving
e164 numbers, it will not IMHO be solved in the IETF.

IMO it is perfectly fine to provide an address with no identity.

Interesting view. I obviously does not appear to be an easy thing;

Fine. But what value does that bring to the recipient, compared to no 
authenticated identity at all?

This is not to say that the IETF could play a useful and essential role. We
can certainly develop and define the requirements, use cases etc. 

In addition the IETF can architect a solution but experience tells me that
deployment and implementation issues surrounding e164 issues will need the
cooperation of "other bodies" which is where the problem lies. It's not
really the ITU, in fact the ITU is a much easier place to get things done
these days. The complications arise with the ITU member states, who
jealously guard their diplomatic and political prerogatives.

This was the conclusion that we drew when the Infrastructure ENUM issues
first arose. We essentially said ..."Here is this problem, this is what we
(IETF) think, the solution is in your court. Have a nice day."

Well, maybe that is what is needed. If there is to be anything 
approaching reliable callerid then there needs to be *something* that is 
directly tied to the "ownership" of E.164 numbers.

IMO authenticated but private is something more then not authenticated.
In first case, you know that on the other end there is an authenticated
user for that domain, in the second one there is a complete lack of
identity ... this entails that there is no reasons why sip uri (e.g.
anonimous@pippo.org) cannot be signed by authentication service.

This uri may be used for special scenarios generating the value you are
looking for.

Please do not assume that the only path to E.164 enlightenment is
ENUM.  

I have one proposal on the table, draft-wing-sip-e164-rrc, which 
does not use ENUM.  My proposal may not be perfect, but it does 
not use ENUM.

Of what value to a recipient is an authenticated From:anonymous@chaos-computer-club.org 
? Or a phished anonymous@bank0fAmerica.com?

In the absence of a reputation service and separate authentication of  
the source domain I don't see any at all. What are your assumed  
preconditions for this authentication to have value?

These need explicit statement.

True.

There are other solution approaches that have a different ownership 
criteria.
draft-wing-sip-e164-rrc, for example, performs a return routability test.

Another "solution" is to not do it.

By that I mean, use RFC 4474 for domain-based security, and if you =

insist on using phone numbers, then it's not "secured that way".

Before the flaming start: by definition, if something is addressed by a pho=
ne
number,  it is something that is likely to be reacheable through the PSTN.

The way security works in the PSTN is completely different. The media is al=
most
never encrypted for one. So in the context of SIP, it means there is a gate=
way =

somewhere destroying the end-to-end nature of the encryption.

Even for the Identity, it's different. For one thing, the Identity assertion
is not end-to-end =E0-la-RFC 4474.

So, I'm proposing that if you are using phone numbers as your identity, then
it is not a design requirement of this group to re-invent a "better" identi=
ty
security system for the PSTN.

It's not because something is a problem that it necessarily needs to be sol=
ved.

My 2 cents.

Oh of course, but you would not get an argument from me if you asserted that
sure the path to damnation is through ENUM.

I think we don't need something *better* than the PSTN, though that =

would be nice. What I think we need is something that is *not worse* =

than the PSTN. The problem is defining what that means.

I think that means at least:

- when you connect via sip you get a callerid for at least those
   pstn callers where you would have gotten one if you had a pstn phone
   *and* that callerid was "correct".

- callerid is available to callees from sip callers with E.164 AORs
   when it hasn't been intentionally blocked and the caller is the
   legitimate "owner" of the number.

- the frequency with which "incorrect" (spoofed) callerid is delivered
   to callees is no worse, on average, than with pure pstn calls.

I realize this are a bit vague and hard to measure. But I think this is =

subjectively what will be required for sip to be widely accepted as a =

substitute for pstn phone service.

There is a distinct difference between a caller who is unknown to me but 
known to someone who is known to me and a caller who is truly anonymous. 
In the first case, if the caller proves to be "a problem", I have some 
recourse through channels. In the second, I do not.

So let us take the typical public network scenario.  If all caller's 
identities are known to the operator, an anonymized identifier asserted 
by that operator could be used to trace a nuisance call back to the 
source. That's useful: It could drive "black listing" operations, "white 
listing" operations, and support legal investigation into harassment 
calls, etc.

I certainly *want* something better than PSTN. But perhaps we don't =

But perhaps the first order of business is to come to agreement on what =

I think we might be talking about two different aspects.

For "phone numbers", I agree with you that parity is ok.

For "email-looking addresses", I believe the bar is higher (and we
have it already with 4474).

Greetings,

While discussing draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer-05, several
questions surfaced.  Christer has requested time to discuss it at the
IETF; however I thought that I'd seek earlier resolution.

Many agree that offers within PRACK should be deprecated.  However since
they are discussed within draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer and these
questions are not limited to PRACK offer, please consider the questions
anyway.

Is rejecting PRACK by a UAS generically allowed by rfc3262?  And if so,
is the 18x 100rel considered acknowledged from UAS perspective always,
never, or sometimes?  And if sometimes, when?

Per rfc3262, is the UAS allowed to reject the PRACK body with responses
such as 488?  And if so, is the 18x 100rel considered acknowledged from
UAS perspective?  If UAC receives a PRACK 488 (or similarly body
response), should it resend PRACK with higher cseq and appropriate
SDP/body modifications/removal if desiring to provide satisfactory
acknowledgement of INVITE 18x?


Recent "sipping-sip-offeranswer-05: comments and questions" discussions
can be found within the sipping email archive; first post was 1/31/2008.
I didn't provide links to the relevant postings since I'm currently
unable to access the IETF email archives.


Thanks,
Brett

In this case there is no expectation that the anonymized address will be 
willing or able to report to anyone what the identity of its client was. 
In the absence of any such assurance, having sip identity is of no use.

OK. THen we aren't far apart. I agree we want and have something better 
for email-style addresses where the domain is significant. It is the 
"phone number" addresses I am concerned with here. I think we must have 
parity, and ideally better when the PSTN isn't involved.

Hi Brett,
 
Thanks for putting this e-mail together.
 
A small correction, though: I have not requested time for this at the meeting. I told Dean that it was an issue missing from his list, which could be a candidate for discussion.
 
Regards,
 
Christer

Subject: rfc3262: validity and meaning of PRACK 488



Greetings,

While discussing draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer-05, several
questions surfaced.  Christer has requested time to discuss it at the
IETF; however I thought that I'd seek earlier resolution.

Many agree that offers within PRACK should be deprecated.  However since
they are discussed within draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer and these
questions are not limited to PRACK offer, please consider the questions
anyway.

Is rejecting PRACK by a UAS generically allowed by rfc3262?  And if so,
is the 18x 100rel considered acknowledged from UAS perspective always,
never, or sometimes?  And if sometimes, when?

Per rfc3262, is the UAS allowed to reject the PRACK body with responses
such as 488?  And if so, is the 18x 100rel considered acknowledged from
UAS perspective?  If UAC receives a PRACK 488 (or similarly body
response), should it resend PRACK with higher cseq and appropriate
SDP/body modifications/removal if desiring to provide satisfactory
acknowledgement of INVITE 18x?


Recent "sipping-sip-offeranswer-05: comments and questions" discussions
can be found within the sipping email archive; first post was 1/31/2008.
I didn't provide links to the relevant postings since I'm currently
unable to access the IETF email archives.


Thanks,
Brett

	I can't find any text in the draft detailing notifier behavior when  
the Accept header is missing in a SUBSCRIBE (RFC 3265 sec 3.1.3  
requires that event packages define the behavior in this case). I  
imagine the easy thing to do is assume that the subscriber can handle  
application/xcap-diff+xml?

Howdy,
	So I read this, then re-read this after having some more coffee,
and I seriously considered re-reading it again after something alcoholic,
just so I could see whether it seemed like a good idea in any of those states.
Since my workplace declines to provide a wet bar, I didn't manage the
last, so there is some chance I'm way off base here.
	First, some comments on the mechanics.  Having a "purpose"
that is not tied to the top level type of the mime type you're transporting
opens you up to a lot of silly states.  If I send you a purpose claiming
something is a pic, but provide text/plain, is it ascii art?  If I claim it is
a pic, but provide application/octet-stream, will the data get fed to
a renderer?  That is, does the MIME type or the purpose handle disposition?
The "Semantics" session seems to indicate it is purpose that governs this:

     Semantics:  Each purpose MUST clearly define what its used for.  T he
      definition must be sufficiently clear to allow an implementation
      to decide whether to render the object, what kind of UI to apply,
      how and where to store the object, how to process it, and so on.

That's going to break how a lot of other things handle MIME object
transport, and incidentally call into question a very basic mechanism
for minting new application protocols currently in favor (that is, using specialty
MIME types to trigger the handling).  I'm not saying it's not a valid design choice,
but it does run counter to the current set of trends.  I also am concerned that in using
the purpose, the design opens things up  to crafted payload attacks. 
	Second, none of the examples seem to show parameters
being included with the MIME types; dealing with those provides a serious
set of problems for interoperability (think of the charset parameters for an
easy example).  Supported MIME types may not be enough to determine
whether you and your intended recipient actually do share enough for
an interoperable transfer.  This is also true with bucket MIME
types (like message/cpim) which can contain other MIME types. 
	I found your description of the session model and the
answerer behavior somewhat unclear, and I'd like some additional
clarification.  In the answerer section, you say:

    An agent receiving an offer with an m=message line including the
   protocol "TOTE" or "TOTES" is being offered the opportunity to set up
   a TOTE session for one or more purposes.  If the agent is capable of
   receiving objects using at least one of the purpose tokens associated
   with the tote session, the agent SHOULD accept the session.  If it
   can receive none of them, it MUST reject the session (by setting the
   port to zero).

The TOTE session described here looks like it is multiplexed for all the original
purposes.  For a receiver to remove one or more purposes from the
original set, do I understand correctly that it needs to tear down the
TOTE session and set up another?  (On a side note, the TOTE vs. TOTES
issue looks to have exactly the same ratholes we've seen before).
	Your draft says:

   An actual TOTE message can
   span several RFC4571 frames; this is analagous in general to reads
   off of a TCP connection - the amount of data read at a time has no
   bearing on the length of the actual message.  As a consequence of
   this, even though RFC4571 has a limit of 64k, there is no constraint
   on the length of a TOTE message.

I assume that this means that a TOTE implementation should not
try to split its messages using any existing MIME facilities for that.
Why not re-use the mechanism of things like message/partial?
It would also be good to describe whether a MIME type like
multipart/alternative SHOULD be split and each alternative listed
in the SDP offer, or whether the multipart/alternative should be
listed.  If the former, the semantics of how to restore the default choice
semantics of multipart/alternative should be described.  If the latter,
how does the receiver know anything about the interal parts' mime types?
 	In other issues, I found the IANA consideration section very
underspecified.   This seriously needs to indicate when a purpose like
"whiteboard" is general and when it is specific to an application.  Having
something that indicates what potential MIME types would be for this
(and a way of updating the registration) would be much better than
the "Description" field you have, and having both would be better still.
The IANA considerations section also needs to re-mention the possibility
of vendor specific purposes, and indicate whether they should conform
to things like the SHOULD limit of 20 characters.  (To put this another
way, your IANA considerations only handle one of the two namespaces,
and should mention the other and describe it as well).  You have
several examples (name, pic, bizcard, whiteboard) in the draft,
but you do not register them.  Why not?
	The Security Considerations don't begin to describe the
issues here, and I assume that would change if this progressed.
I look forward to hearing how the deep-packet inspection industry
enjoys a bi-directional TLS-protected generic MIME tranport that
gets through NATs and Firewalls using relays everyone thought
they were deploying for VoIP.
	On the big picture, I think this is in the muddy middle
in too many ways.  Having an application linked to a specific
transport is pretty well understood.  Having a transfer protocol linked to
very limited application semantics (e.g. FTP) is also pretty well understood.
Having a generic rendezvous mechanism that multiplexes MIME objects
intended for consumption by multiple different applications seems to
run across some pretty rathole-infested ground (head of line blocking
for my camera-control object when I'm sending media to a different
application; MIME disposition ambiguity; interoperability
problems when every vendor chooses their own specific purpose
strings).
	If this is the cure, the disease was much, much worse than
I thought.
	I look forward to my post-work re-read,
					Ted

Yes.

According to RFC 3261, Supported and Require are optional. But if they
are needed, they must be present.
These two header fields are all for standard SIP extensions.

Hi Sudhir,
  "Supported" and "Require" are known as headers rather than methods.
  These two headers have the following significance as per RFC 3261 :
  =20
20.32 Require
The Require header field is used by UACs to tell UASs about options
   that the UAC expects the UAS to support in order to process the
   request.
=20
20.37 Supported
   The Supported header field enumerates all the extensions supported by
   the UAC or UAS.

  If INVITE contains just "Supported" header, the UAS "MAY" send the
non-100 responses reliably as stated in RFC 3262
=20
  If INVITE contains "Require" header, the UAS "MUST" send the non-100
responses reliably. If it does not support this extension, it should
respond to the INVITE with "420 Bad Extension" response.
=20
  Its valid for a UAC to send INVITE with just "Require: 100 rel" header
as well.
Best Regards,
Rekha

Hi All,

Is supported and require methods are required for INVITE request (RFC
3262) or any of method(either Supported or require) will suffice for
INVITE for Provisional ACK. Because I see in one of INVITE(from server)
sending only require: 100Rel, but there is no Supported Header.

Should we treat as complete or incomplete request?

Any response is highly appreciated.=20

Thanks in Advance

>"Here is this problem, this is what we

I believe this puts it in nutshell.

The telecom specific uses of ENUM technology are more appropriately
handled in the telecom standards organizations, such as the ITU-T, and
ETSI.

Let's move on and work with Internet and web addressing that I believe
have the real potential for the Internet standards development and where
IETF resources are better placed.

Thanks, Henry

This is not to say that the IETF could play a useful and essential role.
We
can certainly develop and define the requirements, use cases etc. 

In addition the IETF can architect a solution but experience tells me
that
deployment and implementation issues surrounding e164 issues will need
the
cooperation of "other bodies" which is where the problem lies. It's not
really the ITU, in fact the ITU is a much easier place to get things
done
these days. The complications arise with the ITU member states, who
jealously guard their diplomatic and political prerogatives.

This was the conclusion that we drew when the Infrastructure ENUM issues
first arose. We essentially said ..."Here is this problem, this is what
we
(IETF) think, the solution is in your court. Have a nice day."

Actually what I am hoping to do is to just clearly document the 
applicability of RFC4474 to numbers and be much crisper with guidance on 
when to use it, when to not, what it buys you with numbers (since it 
does help a little even then - receivers can know the domain that 
asserts that number and use blacklists/whitelists to judge trustability).

I also want to make sure we are not basing SRTP security on integrity 
properties delivered with RFC4474, when said properties aren't really 
delivered so well with phone numbers.

Well, it is a little hard to be crisp and clear about the usage of 4474 
with "numbers" when we don't know what a "number" is, nor do we know 
when we have one.
So I am not sure that your stated goal is achievable without first 
solving some other problems.

Yours,
Joel M. Halpern

I disagree.

The presence of an Identity header declares that the  asserter of the  
anonymized identity  of the address, will if suitably encouraged (as  
in a court order), reveal the identity of the client.  If they aren't  
willing to take the responsibility of having made an assertion of  
identity on behalf of that client, then they shouldn't put an Identity  
header in.

I might be more willing to accept a call from an anonymous party if I  
knew that,  should said anonymous party be making a threat, my lawyer  
can subpoena somebody and find the culprit.

Well then, none of the way we use MIME in any of the "considered good"  
uses in SIP must make any sense.

For example, with NOTIFY, the body is some sort of MIME object that  
may well have many different possible uses. It's the event type that  
tells us what that specific mime type means in the context of this  
NOTIFY.

Otherwise said, an event package that defines a NOTIFY contain an  
application/octet-stream has to explain what to do with the octet- 
stream.

What does it mean if we get a NOTIFY containing an image/jpeg? Should  
we display it? File it? Turn it into an mjpeg movie? Run a fingerprint  
recognizer on it? Apply steganogarphic analysis to extract the  
watermark? Here, the handling is driven by the event type, not the  
MIME type.

That's the same as a "purpose" in TOTE. Each TOTE purpose would need  
to be documented, and that documentation would need to explain what  
MIME types can be sent for that purpose, and what it means to receive  
such a type in the context of a given purpose.

The whole argument against INFO is that the MIME type itself is  
inadequate to trigger the handling. If it were adequate, we wouldn't  
have had this big fight about INFO for the last n-many years.

Or are you now saying INFO is good and sip-events are BAD?

   Counterargument: If I call phone number X, and the responding party  
   can complete a media-path handshake against the published key for that  
   number, then I'd claim they "own" it. Possession is, after all,  
   9/10ths of the law.

Whoever publishes the keys ipso facto defines who owns the numbers.
And there's no reason that there would be only one publisher.

I agree that it requires a separate identity service.
It's my understanding that the SIP-Identity mechanism [RFC4474]
makes use of separate authentication services to verify identities.

Thank you for clarifying the use cases of authenticated anonymous address.
I would like to include such use cases in the next version of the draft
if those will be accepted as useful.

Even if the asserter is not going to reveal identity of the client,
you can at least tell whether the call is authenticated by identity
service or not.  On the basis of that, I might want to receive
authenticated anonymous calls but reject simple anonymous calls.

Isn't that like saying we have created the best saddle for unicorns one could possible make?  (and I should note that the saddle isn't even made for all humans to sit in, and isn't even very sturdy)
Ok, maybe unicorn isn't quite right... maybe a Lipizzaner horse.

But event packages are fairly fully specified, compared to what this
draft seems to propose.  If you have an extremely generic statement
like "pic" and expect to extract semantics beyond that of the top
level image/ mime type, I think you're going to get pretty disappointed.
Now that I am re-reading after having gotten "home" (wink-wink),
maybe I did miss the idea.  If the idea is that the specification of
"pic"  or "name" is at the level of the specification of an event package,
then we are dealing with something else entirely and the draft can
be re-written to express that.  But I would expect, in that case, for each
of the registered purposes to be very carefully specified as to what the
acting application would do with them.  And I suspect pretty much
everything like "name" would have to go.

Again, if the level of specification that is expected is equivalent to event
packages, this has some hope of working.  Look at the IANA considerations
section again, though, and I think you'll see that does not appear to
be required by the current draft.

I'm saying that what the draft appears to be replacing INFO with is as bad
as INFO, as the "purpose" looks to be a mighty low-quality signal for
disposition.  There are some existing, common MIME types which
are bad, no question.  "pic", however, doesn't seem to tell you any better than
image/jpeg whether to display, it file, transform it, examine it for watermarks,
or print out the coupon it contains for a free helicopter ride to
CityWest.    Neither image/jpeg or "pic" is likely to do as you as much
good as one of the application-protocol specific MIME types created with
a disposition in mind, like application/atom+xml .

Permit me to suggest a dram or two of a well-tempered liquid, preferably
after it has been aged in a wood barrel of some kind.  It might not result
in clarity, but that won't bother you nearly as much.

Hi Henry,

there are two aspects to the story:

* Do you believe there is a problem for security when interworking 
between the PSTN and SIP?
(e.g., in the way how SIP Identity deals with E.164 numbers)

* If yes, do you think that someone should be investigating what todo 
about it?

Don't get hung-up in the details of a specific strawman proposal that, I 
believe, shows quite well some of the challenges around the aspect of 
E.164 number ownership.

Ciao
Hannes

Jonathan,

I agree with a lot of what this says. A few comments:

1. "Unfortunately, this problem is a FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF PHONE
   NUMBERS.  No specifications or efforts on the part of IETF can fix
   this problem.  Phone numbers are fundamentally NOT scoped to a
   domain, and attempts to represent them in any other form are
   ultimately futile from an identification perspective."
But on the other hand, you can at least see what domain the request came
from, and if you trust that domain, this might be of value. The
particular value of the user part of the SIP URI may not be some
important, in some scenarios, as the domain part. This seems to be
acknowledged later when it talks about the "second model".

2. "However, in the second model, intermediate domains do not resign
   requests.  Furthermore, UA's utilize white lists and black lists of
   domains that are known to be trustworthy (or not).  Today, such lists
   do exist and are provided for email spam.  One can imagine a UA
   contacting such a service periodically, or upon an incoming call, to
   verify the signing domain against the list."
Or maybe the user is expecting a call from a particular domain (e.g.,
his bank) or answers the call and the caller announces that he/she is
from the bank. Of maybe the user has called his bank and uses
connected-identity to ensure that he really is connected to his bank.
These all seems to be situations akin to the second model with some
practical benefit.

3. "Thus, DTLS-SRTP still provides better security than Sdescriptions.
   However, when used with phone numbers, it is by no means ideal.  Most
   importantly, it does NOT provide guarantees that intermediaries have
   not been able to intercept and decrypt the media."
Not true. If you use DTLS-SRTP with RFC 4474 and an E.164 number in the
SIP URI, it DOES provide a guarantee that intermediaries between the
domain in the SIP URI and the UAS are unable to intercept and decrypt
media. This seems to be of value in some situations.

John

Yes, I think this is the right direction. I would not want to prevent
investigations on how to do it better, e.g., based on the ENUM tree in
some way. But what you propose is a practical step that gives some value
in the short term, both in terms of anti-spam and DTLS-SRTP.

Perhaps we also need to do even more to promote email-style SIP URIs,
alongside Tel URIs for use when interworking with PSTN. This does not
necessarily prevent the use of numeric values in the user part of
email-style URIs (without user=phone), thereby making it easier to
correlate the a SIP URI with the telephone number that would need to be
used to contact the user from the PSTN. Perhaps it would be beneficial
to provide both an email-style SIP URI and a Tel URI in From, so that
the Tel URI can be used if the call breaks out to PSTN (where end-to-end
security is not achievable) and the SIP URI can be used in other cases.

Hannes,

[JRE] There are actually two separate situations: use of E.164 numbers
for communication within the SIP world; and use of E.164 numbers when
interworking between SIP and PSTN. Did you intentionally limit your
question to the second of these?
Assuming that was the intention, I would point out that we can never
achieve end-to-end security when interworking with PSTN. The best we can
do is achieve security across the local SIP part as far as the PSTN
gateway. There are different opinions as to whether the PSTN itself is
secure - I won't express an opinion on that aspect. However, what
happens beyond the PSTN? Another SIP hop? An H.323 hop? There is no way
of knowing whether that is secured or not. Some guarantee of security as
far as the gateway is the best we can achieve, and, importantly, the
user should be made aware of this - do not raise his expectations
concerning the end-to-end security of the call.

Let's concentrate on the end-to-end SIP case and provide a good security
solution for that. One possibility might be to use email-style URIs for
that.

Unfortunately email-style URIs make identity portability harder. Number
portability is a regulatory requirement in many countries and solved for
E.164 numbers. I can imagine that regulators might require an equivalent
feature from SIP providers.

Hadriel,

Thanks for this draft. One comments:

When talking about changing the host part of SIP URIs, are you referring
just to SIP URIs containing an E.164 number in telephone-subscriber
format (e.g.: +123456789@example.com;user=phone)? Or are you also
talking about other forms of URI that look like E.164 number (e.g.,
+123456789@example.com)? Presumably you are not talking about email
style URIs.

John

Ernst,

In a separate message on this list earlier today I suggested email-style
along with TEL URIs. The latter would be used when interworking with
PSTN and would allow number portability to be achieved.

Also, for enterprises email-style still gives number portability - an
enterprise would keep its domain name even when changing the SIP
carrier. Admittedly that model doesn't work for an individual user that
relies on the carrier's domain.

John

I wanted to make people on this list aware of an effort at SPEC to develop
an industry-standard SIP benchmark.  SPEC is a non-profit corporation
formed to establish, maintain and endorse a standardized set of relevant
benchmarks that can be applied to the newest generation of high-performance
computers. SPEC develops benchmark suites and also reviews and publishes
submitted results from our member organizations and other benchmark licensees.

The SPEC SIP SubCommittee was established in March of 2007 and has been
chartered with designing, developing, and releasing a benchmark.  The
benchmark design document is completed, and development of the benchmark
is under way with an expected release date of 2Q 2008.

The design document is available for review at

        http://www.spec.org/specsip

The design document is a result of a collaborative, consensus effort
with participation from AMD, BEA, Columbia University, Communigate
Systems, HP, Intel, IBM, and Sun Microsystems.  There is also a design
FAQ to answer common questions.

I'm making this announcement for two reasons:

- To solicit feedback about the design document.  Most of our members
  are on the server side rather than ISP or NEP side, and getting
  additional perspective would of course help.

- To encourage participation in the SPEC SIP SubCommittee.  There's
  still plenty of opportunity to influence the benchmark and help in
  the development, testing, and documentation.

While participating in SPEC does cost money, we can allow temporary
participation on a trial basis in the SubCommittee so that people can
test it out and see if they want to pursue it.  We have weekly calls on
Thursdays at 10:00 AM Pacific.  We could also schedule an extra call if
there is enough demand.  You can find out more about SPEC membership at

        http://www.spec.org/spec/membership.html

Please contact me if interested. I'll also try to respond to any comments
about the design document posted on the mailing list.

Thanks,

-Erich

Section 3.2 suggests there is no definition for Infrastructure ENUM. At lea=
st reference RFC 5067!

Section 3.3  wallet garden model? I like that :-)

Is there a reason why a carrier can't use infrastructure ENUM to certify a =
given populated caller ID using a general rather than a specific key? (If t=
hey were willing to)

Well ENUM is on a short leash in Philadelphia with only 1 hour, we are
trying to slowly but deliberately wind things down. It might not be the best
time, but we certainly have large body of expertise in dealing with E.164
numbers and the history of trying to deal with number mappings in globally
distributed databases. :-) =


It's certainly something worth discussing the ENUM WG list from time to time
but the real issues are all layer 8 and above.

Hi John,

you are essentially suggesting to use an identifier like 
+123456789@example.com;user=phone whereby example.com corresponds to the 
domain that operates the authentication service?

Ciao

This should not be a surprise to anyone...

Due to the complex management of of E.164 numbers, which includes  
management, routing to, billing models and everything else, I have  
personally all the time thought sip-email-like addresses "win". That  
will be the format used for routing of "calls" in the future. Full stop.

What ENUM solves is something that can be viewed as an intermediary  
problem on mapping from the (old) E.164 addressing to the (new) domain  
name based.

Sure, E.164 numbers will be around for a Very Long Time, but domain  
based address is what the Internet use, and what people will use in  
the future. And btw, even more quickly grows the use of VCard like  
mechanisms (electronic business cards) which imply the end user have  
absolutely no idea what identifier is used to set up the call. The  
application select the fragment of the VCard that it can understand,  
and routing mechanisms (on application layer) must be smart enough to  
ensure the call setup actually works.

Because of this, of course E.164 based mechanisms MUST work also on  
the Internet, but it MUST at the same time be remembered that it is an  
old technology that will not grow anymore. Because of this I urge  
people to NOT base any service/application solutions on the function,  
working and deployment of E.164 numbers.

Please use Domain Name based addressing instead.

Dean,

I don't think I agree.

In the non-anonymous case, the asserter will attest that the source is 
entitled to claim the address. AFAIK nothing else is implied. But assume 
it will provide more - for instance the name, address, and SS# of the 
person entitled to the address.

Now assume that the address is an "anonymous" address. The asserter will 
then be providing information about the anonymizer, not the entity that 
is being anonymized. Its entirely possible (likely) that the anonymizer 
won't maintain records that would give it the capability of reporting on 
the address being anonymized.

If some UAS prefers an anonymous address that has been authenticated, 
then I have no objection, though I consider it irrational. But I don't 
see this as a necessary condition for a privacy mechanism.

well, having tried to do that for something like ten years now, and 
having STILL seen the industry primarily doing pstn replacement which 
requires phone numbers, I am somewhat skeptical that there is anything 
IETF can do here.

Now that is a topic worth discussing.

 From can only have a single URI. Interestingly PAI does allow more; you 
can assert both a tel and a SIP URI. What would be really nice is to be 
able to assert both the phone number and the username in the From and 
have the domain covered by the 4474 signature. As my draft points out, 
there is some small value in the 4474 signature there.

One way to do this for example would be something horrible like this:

From: sip:jdrosen*+14089023084@cisco.com;user=composite

where "composite" means that the user part is a series of names within 
the domain, each one separated by "*".

Unfortunately that would work much better in theory than in practice 
since I think most implementations ignore the user attribute of the URI 
and would not know that they shouldn't render this weird looking user part.

Probably the better solution is some hybrid where PAI is used for the 
phone numbers and 4474 for the user@domain identifier. Thats another 
thing useful we could do, is to try and clarify how PAI and 4474 work in 
concert. Right now that is clear as mud.

I am sorry for my late answer. After long time I have found time for the
draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06 reading.

I have following notices:
1) Section 3 contains small typo in paragraph under the figure 2. There
is written "If the endpoint and two proxies involved follow RFC 3260
recommendations, the tree ..." - There should be RFC 3261.

2) Section 4.1: The 2nd and 4th paragraph uses different words in the
same meaning - "destination" and "location". My opinion is that it could
be a little misleading. I thing the word "location" is according to RFC
3261 terminology.

3) The draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06 shows and describes in detail two
horrible examples when a proxy follows only RFC 3261 recommendations.
Why this document doesn't also show result of recommendations described
by this document? I thing something like following text is very
motivating for implementation of shown recommendations.

When proxies follow recommendation of RFC XXXX, the number of stimulated
messages is reduced to 14 and message tree looks like depicted on Figure
X. In case of simplified attack using twice the same uri with two
different uri parameters, the number of stimulated messages is reduced
to 10.

I'd say that the sooner that we stop worrying about what happens
when the signaling and media streams cease to be transported by
IP, the sooner our sanity will seek us out again.  Or even less than
that. We can't possibly even enumerate all of the potential hazards
even within the IP realm like, oh say, media->email/MIME
attachments re-posted to Usenet.

It seems that we have two parallel worlds: one using email-style 
addresses and another using phone numbers. While there are some devices 
that can play in both worlds, the majority of devices can only play in 
one of the worlds, or at least are strongly biased towards one so that 
usability with the other form is compromised.

It seems essential that sip find a way to be successful in the phone 
number world - at least to the extent that a sip device in not perceived 
as being functionally worse than a comparable device using PSTN 
protocols. No amount of arguing that things would be better if you just 
used an email-style address will win the day there.

The alternative is to accept that sip is worse than native PSTN 
equipment for phone numbers, and hope that the parallel communications 
world based on email-style addresses will eventually win out. But that 
is like waiting for IPv4 to be replaced by IPv6.

If the intermediary created the RFC4474 signature itself -- which
is necessary if the intermediary changed the SDP -- the intermediary
could have also changed the a=fingerprint.  Changing the a=fingerprint
allows the intermediary to perform the DTLS-SRTP handshake itself and
thus decrypt the SRTP packets to/from both callers.

draft-kaplan-sip-uris-change-00.txt describes reasons why an 
intermediary might want or need to change the SDP and the From URI.

Most intermediaries are service providers.  Most service providers
operate SBCs.  All SBCs change the SDP (otherwise, they would merely
be B2BUAs).

Ok, I think I agree with you here. Each "purpose" would need to be  
very clearly specified, at roughly the same level of detail as is  
required for an event package or would be required for an INFO package  
if we were to go that way. And yes, the draft is a bit short on this  
right now.

Well then in most jurisdictions it can go to jail for contempt of  
court when it can't respond to the court order. Seriously, you really  
shouldn't be acting as an identity service if you have no way to  
validate the identity being asserted against. It's like notarizing a  
signature on a document without checking the signer's ID.

In other words, the anonymizer and the identity service MUST be  
integrated. The identity service needs to perform an identity  
verification check on the user BEFORE anonymizing, if it's going to  
act as an identity service for that user. Slapping an identity record  
on something that's been anonymized elsewhere is worse than useless.

We are entering the realm of legal opinion, where I am not qualified to 
operate. But I will still render an opinion.

I could potentially operate an anonymization service simply by getting 
two PSTN phones. If you want my service, you call me on one of my lines 
and tell me who you want to call. I call that number with my other line, 
and just hold the receivers together to couple the media.

The recipient will get the callerid of my 2nd line. You can serve me 
with a court order to provide the actual identity of the caller, but it 
won't do any good because I don't know who that was.

Further, I am not identity provider. My telco provider is the identity 
provider for the line. A court order to them also will serve no purpose.

I don't *think* anybody is violating any laws here.

I see a sip anonymization service as being logically equivalent to the 
above.

Hello,

=20

I would like to be able to signal a video channel using SIP.  I have
seen in SDP how to signal the codec, the bandwidth and the rtpmap but I
don't see how to signal frame rates, frame sizes, and other negotiable
capabilities of a video codec.  Can you point me to how this is done?  I
see that in SDP, I can use the "a" for attributes but are there some
standard identifiers that are being used by the industry or described in
some rfc for how to do this?

Some would argue that you could be held culpable due to aiding and  
abetting. What happens if someone uses the open access point at your  
house to send threatening messages to the white house? What happened  
to the folks who ran the anonymous remailer service in Finland a while  
back? (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penet_remailer)

Laws vary. But we're I thought we were talking about another  
situation, see below.

I didn't say you couldn't have a SIP anonymization service.  I'm  
saying that if you're running an identity service that inserting an  
identity header asserting that you know who the message is from when  
you don't actually know who the message is from  is a bad idea.

Conversely, there is a legitimate role for a service that is both an  
anonymizer and an asserter of identity. The assertion here is "I know  
who this person is, but I'm not telling you without proper cause". As  
an end user, I'd be inclined to grant this a higher level of trust  
than I would a message that claims nothing about who it might be from.

I think it's time for a reality check...

In the PSTN, if you are an enterprise and have a trunk to a service provider,
you can pretty much put whatever you want in the Calling Party Number (you
can't do that from home with an individual line as the CO puts the Calling
Party Number for you). The network will pass it for you to the other end.

So, not only is the identity in PSTN "hop-by-hop" and not end-to-end, anybody 
with suitable trunk interface can spoof anybody else.

So again, I don't see why WE need to worry about phone number identity.

I agree with Jonathan that we should just document the limitations.

And personally, I don't mind if we restrict the usefulness end-to-end
identity (4474) to addresses where the domain name actually matters and is
not ignored (as is the case with user=phone type numbers).

As far as I know, both true E.164 and those that "look like" E.164 are being changed, as well as NANP/local-exchange format, emergency code, and some cellular-specific number formats, etc.  To be honest I really believe a lot of these truly are E.164 or non-local-scope numbers in nature/meaning, and just aren't using the exact format one would want.  In other words it's as Paul says "do what I mean, not what I say".

Really some of the rules are pretty simplistic, including even just change it regardless of username format.  But I would consider those just bad and need to be corrected, and will if email-style URI's start showing up.

Really though I don't think there's much/any email-style URIs crossing provider borders. (inside Enterprises or within a provider may be, but that doesn't need rfc4474)  Or maybe it's just my particular customers, or my kind of customers.  I dunno.  I find everyone on the IETF list has a different view of SIP, because they represent different users/markets.

Hi,
 
You should check out the AVT WG. They specify these kind of SDP attributes for different codecs.

Subject: [Sip] Signaling Video Details



Hello,

 

I would like to be able to signal a video channel using SIP.  I have seen in SDP how to signal the codec, the bandwidth and the rtpmap but I don't see how to signal frame rates, frame sizes, and other negotiable capabilities of a video codec.  Can you point me to how this is done?  I see that in SDP, I can use the "a" for attributes but are there some standard identifiers that are being used by the industry or described in some rfc for how to do this?

 

 

Thank You,

   Ok, I think I agree with you here. Each "purpose" would need to be  
   very clearly specified, at roughly the same level of detail as is  
   required for an event package or would be required for an INFO package  
   if we were to go that way.

IMHO the purposes need to be specified in *more* detail than an event
package.  The reason is that an event package is "pull" information,
the meaning of the information is defined by the event-name, but the
requestor is presumed to know *why* it wants the information, that is,
what it intends to do based on that information.  A TOTE object, like
an INFO, is "push" information, and the attached meta-data must
specify not only what the information means, but how the recipient is
expected to act on it.

Dale

Paul,

That is not quite what I meant. I meant that for PSTN interworking there
is no point in trying to do anything more secure on the SIP hop than the
security provided by the PSTN hop and anything beyond the PSTN. Security
is only as good as the weakest link. So let's try to be as good, but not
better. In the SIP world we can try to be better.

Most devices today either don't support SRTP or support it using
Sdescriptions. As devices evolve to support DTLS-SRTP, they too must
evolve to exploit email-style URIs, because little benefit seems to be
achieved by using of DTLS-SRTP with E.164 numbers, especially if devices
display the number part and don't display, or don't give prominence to,
the domain part.

*ANY* anonymization service will have this problem. It can know who *it* 
is getting the message from, but it cannot know if that source is acting 
as a relay point. If it can't provide identity without knowing that then 
it can never provide identity.

Yes, I guess there could be some value in such a thing. But it will only 
be valuable if the recipient of the identity can determine it has this 
property.

If I get a call from an address I don't recognize (which is typically be 
the way I will see it if there is an anonymizer involved) then how am I 
to know:
- this is an anonymizer (as opposed to a direct call from somebody
   I don't know)
- that this anonymizer will be willing and able to disclose the
   identity under certain circumstances
- what those circumstances are

Dan,

Well, yes, if the intermediary changes the From URI and resigns, at
least you know that you have security only as far as that intermediary.
If the originating URI is carried elsewhere in the header,
intermediaries might be less likely to change it, but if they do the
same consideration applies. Unfortunately, as noted on another thread,
there is the difficulty of bringing this fact (that security is only as
far as the intermediary) to the attention of the user.

Why hasn't somebody sued a SP for providing false identity???

The SP *should* be restricting what the enterprise can put based on the 
numbers that the SP knows belong to the enterprise. (The SP doesn't need 
to care if the number is the precise one originating this call.)

But I knew this. In principle the reliability of the pstn callerid is 
nonexistent. But because it is somewhat difficult for most users to 
spoof, *on average* callerid is reasonably reliable. Enough so that many 
can/do make use of it.

(Admittedly the ease of spoofing is increasing, and so the average 
reliablility of callerid is probably going down.)

The problem is that with sip phones if there is no form of authenticated 
identity in use, the ease of spoofing is much easier. So if we use 
nothing on sip phones then end user perceived reliability of callerid 
will be degraded. So the question is: how can we get the *perceived* 
reliability of callerid with sip and phone numbers up to the perceived 
level of the pstn?

Perhaps the solution *is* to wait for the perceived reliability on the 
pstn to go down. (When people stop believing callerid altogether they 
will be ready to by sip phone service.)

I certainly don't mind if we have separate mechanisms for email-style 
addresses and phone number addresses, or that the guarantee is better 
for the email-style.

Hold on a second. Doesn't SIP have the concept of redirection? That is,
even if I use a tel: URL I might get redirected to another device which
doesn't ever touch the PSTN?

It sure seems to me that the prudent thing to do is *always* use the
best security you can instead of trying to divine whether it's going
to end up being on a less secure path.

In other words it's as Paul says "do what I mean, not what I say".

(inside Enterprises or within a provider may be, but that doesn't need rfc4474)  Or maybe it's just my particular customers, or my kind of customers.  I dunno.  I find everyone on the IETF list has a different view of SIP, because they represent different users/markets.

I expect you might get a different story from Microsoft. (But then they 
probably aren't a customer of yours.)

That is what I meant about it being two different worlds. Each world has 
its own set of SPs. And they aren't very good at peering with one another.

I agree with Mike here.

People are clearly tolerating a less than ideal situation in the pstn. 
Many know that the mechanisms for securing the callerid (and the media) 
are not 100%, but they think they are also more than 0% and are willing 
to tolerate the level they get.

We ought to be pulling the percentages up, rather than down. E.g. being 
able to assert that the information is accurate back to the nearest PSTN 
gw is better than not.

We have traditionally presumed that if the party requesting anonymity/ 
identity can pass a digest authentication or equivalent test that some  
level of assertion about the identity of that party is warranted.

the anonymizing identity service has an included an Identity header  
signed by the identity service. That's different from NOT having one.

Consider the difference between a SIP request with a "From:" of "agent@fbi.gov 
" and the same request carrying an RFC 4474 Identity body that is  
signed with the FBI.GOV cert (which validates back to a trusted root).

Or consider the difference between this message, and a similar one  
signed by  the self-signed cert for "john smith".

As in all certificate work, you have to have knowledge of the policy  
and role of a signer in order to decide what sort of trust you wish to  
extend to it.


>

I see this is more a function of "identity" than "anonymity". If you  
act as an identity service, whether anonymizing or not,  then you  
probably need a policy statement about your identity service just as  
every CA needs a policy statement about its credential service.  But  
mosly, it comes down to a trusted relationship.

A signature from an anonymizing identity service that you don't trust  
obviously adds no value.

Let's talk about the context of eBay. Buyers and sellers occasionally  
communicate outside of the offer-bid cycle. This has raised the  
opportunity for all sorts of fraudulent activity, such as forged "2nd- 
chance" offers.

Ebay found it necessary to put in its own messaging infrastructure  
which provides for authenticated transmission. If you get a message in  
that channel claiming to be from the seller of an item on which you  
are bidding, there is a much higher probability that this is true than  
if you get such a message from a 3rd parry email server. Here, eBay is  
acting as an identity service -- somebody presumably had to be able to  
log into eBay as the seller in order to be able to send the message.  
The seller is still more-or-less anonymous -- we don't know who they  
are -- but eBay has vouched for their role, and we know that if things  
go bad, they'll attempt to apply their published policy in resolving  
the situation.

Extending to the SIP anonymous/pseudonymous/identity discussion, I  
might get an INVITE from "Anonymous" that carries an Identity header  
verifiably from eBay. From this, I'd know that the party contacting me  
has a verified relationship with eBay, and I'd be able to make some  
decision about that message that might be a different decision than if  
the Identity header were not present.

And yes, there's all sorts of room for SAML-like things added to  
Identity headers.

It's also because the telephony service provider has additional  
logging records that can be used to back-trace the call if it turns  
out to have been fraudulently identified.

Try this experiment: Take your home ISDN BRI line. Add your own  
terminal adapter with POTS interface (if you don't have one, I'll be  
happy to sell you one of mine -- I have several that need to be  
eBayed). Dummy up your CPID field to whatever you want (this works, at  
least here on Verizon lines). Now place a crank call to somebody very  
important, and see how long it takes for the authorities to show  
up . . .

Security can be reduced by such a sequence, but it can never be  
increased beyond that of the weakest link.

So if a call is coming from the PSTN, the trust anchor is the identity  
assertion of the PSTN, which is weak.  Putting really cleaver crypto  
on it makes it no stronger. However, it can mask the weakness of an  
assertion by making it look stronger, which could be its own sort of  
bad thing.

To paraphrase Postel's maxim:

Be appropriately secure in what you send, and suspicious of what you  
receive.

Good advice also comes from Shakepeare, who gave us the wise words of  
Polonious  to Hamlet that might be phrased applicably as:

Neither gild nor dross a message's integrity;
For  faux increase doth thy recipients faith offend;
And false discard dulls the edge of security.

I'm sorry, but I don't get this. If I send to a tel: URL in the clear 
because
I think it's going to hit an "insecure" link, I'm better off even if it 
turns
out that the tel: URL never made it to the PSTN? How does that make
any sense?

In fact, I'd expect that as VoIP becomes more prevalent, this sort of
situation will become more and more common since e.164 will be
more and more vestigial. This idea of trying to divine what happens
outside of the scope of SIP to affect SIP signaling is the path to
insanity.

But let's put it another way: who on earth would want to maintain
the crufty hacks and pretzel logic to implement this in 5 years time?

   That, treating anything that smells like an E.164 like an E.164, may 
   well be common practice.
   But it seems to me
   a) it is a practice which is inherently misleading and error prone
   b) it is a practice we can not sensibly design for / around.
   c) It is not the working group's problem to repair security flaws 
   introduced by such behavior.  It is the vendor's problem.

I agree with you strongly.  If one wants to specify an E.164 number,
one should use a tel: URI (with the right qualifiers).  In a Sip: URI,
one can only map an E.164-like user-part into an E.164 number if one
knows that the policy of the specified domain is to do so.

It does sound like many systems make broader assumptions.

We may want to introduce the concept of using tel: URIs in SIP
systems, by which the UA delegates the proxy to choose the "best way"
to get to the specified E.164 destination.

It makes perfect sense to strongly assert an identity than one has  
high confidence in, and if we're lucky enough to have an end-to-end  
path that preserves the integrity of the assertion, then we're good.  
What happens if we aren't so lucky?

I'm more concerned about the "other direction" -- that is, an identity  
assertion that came from the PSTN is never going to be stronger than  
the PSTN, no matter how we package it. And by packaging it wrongly, we  
can give a false impression as to its validity.

A link that transitions "downward" on the axes of integrity protection  
doesn't need to inform the next hop of this downgrade; the next hop  
can assume that the integrity protection is no stronger than that  
provided by the immediately preceding link. It's when links try to  
upgrade the protections that errors are introduced.

It is entirely possible that our "security" mechanisms might be  
deployed in such a way that the eventual recipient is blinded to the  
weakness of such an assertion and therefore makes a mistake in  
trusting it. If the cryptographic envelope is "upgraded", we need some  
way to preserve the provenance of the assertion in order to keep this  
form happening.

The simplest approach is to always  consider a "tel:" assertion to be  
at the PSTN level of strength, even if it came from an IP source.

This would imply "use domain-level source addressing when you can; if  
coming from PSTN, use telephone addressing, and never convert back".

I think it depends on what you think the future looks like.

Yes a PBX PRI can spoof a CLID, though I would argue it's much harder to fake an ANI (because of who sets it).  But anyway, I think such a thing is more limited in scope on the PSTN simply because there is less benefit to doing it.  If you do it from a PRI, there is a physical link and switch records can be used to track back, and so your gain is limited - unless it's targeted at specific individuals (which makes that very insidious).  Add to that that it still costs money to make the calls usually, and the benefit goes down further.

But if you think in the future (a) call cost approaches zero or becomes bulk in nature, at least for voip-voip calls, and (b) voip peering grows and/or open providers are included, then the benefit of CLID spoofing grows to potentially make SPIT profitable or Phishing attacks untraceable.  It's not a near-term problem, and may never be a problem.  It's just that email has such a problem and so there's concern that SIP could too someday.

But since there's no way to stop the signer from simply converting to a sip-URI, or decide/not to sign things, what you're saying is the verifier/UAS  must not believe the ID of any signed request if the From is an E.164, regardless of sip|sips|tel, right?  And since the signer could just remove the user=phone param before signing, you're saying the UAS can't believe it if the username even looks like an E.164?

[JRE] The problem is a call that comes from a different part of a large
enterprise, with a number that is not within the range of numbers
reachable from that particular SP. Or a call that comes from outside the
enterprise and then is forwarded to the PSTN (say to the enterprise
user's home or mobile phone). This "unscreened" number can
advantageously be passed to the callee.

[JRE] I agree, but when a PSTN gateway is encountered we may have to
downgrade to the level of security appropriate to a mixed SIP-PSTN call.

[JRE] Agreed. But this is still a downgraded security, because the fact
that I have a secure connection to a PSTN gateway doesn't tell me
anything about the end-to-end security.

Mayumi,

I would note that RFC 4474 already allows option 1. I see various emails
discussing the usefulness of this. I can see it as beneficial where a
domain wishes to assert that the request originated in that domain, but
does not wish to disclose the particular user ID, e.g., in call centres.

Given that this is already allowed in RFC 4474, I would prefer that the
ua-privacy draft does nothing to deprecate that.

Of course, we also need to allow the use of option 2.

I don't see a need for option 3, and I haven't heard anyone else
speaking in its favour.

John

Just to put some background to what is happening here with caller id in
the PSTN.

If the calling terminal provides a caller id, then the public network
has two options:

-	it screens it (is this line entitled to use this number) and
puts it in the ISUP calling party number field
-	it does not screen it and puts it in the generic number
parameter. The calling party number has some sort of default number for
the access.

Which of these it does depends on a special arrangement. US providers
appear to give that special arrangement to everyone. European operators
will either give that special arrangement only to PBX customers (i.e.
they trust the PBX operator to configure the equipment to deliver
numbers to some level of trust), or they do not provide it at all (no
trust). The reason for this is based on history.

At the terminating side calling line identity is provided using the
content on the generic number if present, and then on the calling party
number (in ISDN both are delivered by the second may well be discarded).

Malicious call identification (the network recording call details) is
based primarily on the contents of the calling party number, and only
optionally records other identities. Therefore if the police do bother
to turn up, they will turn up to the address associated with the default
number for that line if the special arrangement exists.

And none of this is capable of being mimicked completely by RFC 3325 or
RFC 4474 so that provides yet another set of rules.

Regards

Keith

You are saying that the enterprise has numbers assigned/managed by 
multiple SPs, and the call is entering the PSTN from the enterprise via 
a GW attached to SP1 while the asserted number is managed by SP2?

In that case the enterprise in effect acting as a transit network. 
Either the SP must really *trust* the enterprise, or else it should have 
a list of all the numbers assigned to the enterprise, or else it should 
treat this as invalid or block the identity. The enterprise can solve 
this by entering the PSTN through the SP that can verify the ID.

Only an issue if the call is hairpinned through the enterprise.

If it is, then again it is acting as a transit network, and trust is 
required.

Of course trust is a dangerous thing, especially in the last case. How 
did the enterprise verify this identity before reasserting it?

But I see your point. The SPs may have caved to demands from their 
customers to trade off accuracy vs functionality.

John,

I agree. Taking the number learned from the PSTN and asserting it with 
something akin to sip identity would be asserting more than is known.

It seems that some weaker form of assertion is needed. (PSTN-grade 
security.)

I think it might be worthwhile to keep in mind that there's more to
overall security than absolute guarantees that can be made to
individuals. Security is also about populations, and overall risk
management. Mainly what we're trying to do is get the bad guys
to find somebody else to annoy rather than hoping you can survive a
full frontal attack. Defending the SIP side of the house regardless of
any weaker links is just inviting the bad guys to go find something else
to do with their time which most likely has nothing to do with telephony
at all since the pstn side of this is already pretty well understood.

       Mike

That would be one way to handle it "by convention". There may be  
better solutions.

With email and DKIM, there are really two kinds of assertions that can be
made:

1) this message came from me
2) this message passed through me

I actively don't want to sign messages that purport to come from me from
sources I don't trust (like, say, the internet). The second is more of a 
statement
of fact, essentially being a digitally signed received: (via) header.

I think that both are interesting assertions for filters, and it seems 
to me that
the same situation exists with SIP. For example, I may want to whitelist
anything coming through ietf.org even though I can't _really_ count on
the validity of the From: address. That's because experience tells me that
the likelihood of ietf.org being an attack vector is extremely low.

Exactly.

For example, me sitting in California can make a SIP call to somebody in Texas.
Internally, it will be routed through our internal network until it reaches
a PSTN gateway in Texas (least-cost routing). That gateway will insert my california
CLID in the ISDN message.

And yes, this is totally prone to abuse. But the benefits have been judged
by the industry to outweight the cost.

So, trying to fix the "phone number" assertion problem seems (a) out of scope
of what IETF's mandate is and (b) unlikely to be solveable.

That is why my thinking is that we should focus on things were we can actually
make a difference. "Email-looking addresses" or "Addresses where the domain
matters" fall in that category.

Putting a warning that if the system routes on the "user part" instead of the
"domain" (like is often the case with phone numbers), it breaks domain-based
identity assertion is a good start.

(As WG chair)

This is to announce a WG last call on BOTH

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-domain-certs-00.txt

and

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-eku-01.txt

Comments should be submitted to both the list, and to the authors, by
Friday 7th March 2008. This will give the opportunity for discussion of
major issues at the SIP WG meeting in Philadelphia.

Please clearly identify the position of any issue in the internet draft,
and if possible identify what you would like to see as a correction.
Please also indicate the nature or severity of the error or correction,
e.g. Major technical, minor technical, NIT, so that we can quickly judge
the extent of problems with the document.

Note that both these documents are used by:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-09.txt

This particular document is finished and ready for the publication
request, but if you feel your comment also addresses the usage by this
document, please clearly indicate and get the comment in.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Addressing Record-Route issues in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : T. Froment, C. Lebel
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-record-route-fix-02.txt
	Pages           : 26
	Date            : 2008-02-22

A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is to
set a Record-Route header on initial requests in order to make
subsequent requests pass through it.  This header contains a SIP
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) indicating where and how the
subsequent requests should be sent to reach the proxy.  Like any SIP
URI, it can contain sip or sips schemes, IPV4 or IPV6 addresses, and
URI parameters that could influence the routing like different
transport parameters (UDP, TCP, SCTP...), or a compression indication
like "comp=sigcomp".  When a proxy has to change some of those
parameters between its incoming and outgoing interfaces (multi-homed
proxies, transport protocol switching, sip to sips or IPV4 to IPV6
scenarios...), the question arises on what should be put in Record-
Route header(s).  It is just not possible to make one header having
the characteristics of both sides at the same time.  This document
aims to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified on
this topic; it formally recommends the use of the double Record-Route
technique as an alternative to the current RFC3261 text, which
describes only a Record-Route rewriting solution.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-record-route-fix-02.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

FYI, the draft on the Baiting attack with RFC4474 has been updated:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-sip-baiting-attack-02.txt

I changed section 12.1 possible solution to the problem of the request being delivered to unintended recipients.

This new solution only works for true SIP ends, vs. to a PSTN-gateway, but based on the mailing list discussion so far that appears to be a behavior the WG may want in the end.
(Personally I feel one might as well then only make RFC4474 work for SIPS URIs with S/MIME bodies, but that's just personal opinion)

[JRE] The purpose of RFC 4474 was to provide authentication without
requiring a certificate at the UA - S/MIME requires a certificate!

S/MIME requires a separate body part, too.  But SIP neglected to
clearly require support for multipart MIME and many implmentations 
neglect to include support for multipart MIME.  Robert Sparks 
collected information on multipart MIME support a SIPit or two 
ago, <http://www.sipforum.org/content/view/294/171>:

   " This is how the endpoints answered how they supported
     multipart/mime:

       7%  I break if someone sends me multipart/mime
      30%  I pretend multipart mime doesn't exist if someone sends 
           it to me
      20%  I ignore multipart/mime, but will proxy it or hand it 
           to my application if it shows up
      17%  I try to do something useful with multipart/mime I 
           receive, but I never send it
       3%  I ignore multipart/mime I receive, but I try to send it 
           to do something useful
      20%  I try to do something useful with multipart/mime I 
           send and receive "

I expect any SIP functionality that relied on multipart MIME would have
disappointing results in the field unless these numbers vastly improve.  But
without multipart MIME messages, implementors have little reason to code or
test it.

Sorry for my followup, then; the joke was lost in the translation

It only gets pushed to the client if the client indicates support for 
it. Thus, the typical flow is:

A->B : "hey, you can send me pic if you want"
B->A : "ok I will"

and I think this is very much like:

A->B : "please send be pic"
B->A : "ok I will"

which is what SIP events is about. In terms of the need to understand 
the semantics of the data, they are identical.

Now, the intended model in TOTE is that there would be two types of 
purpose parameters. Global ones which are standardized, and a vendor 
tree. The global ones require a specification, though it doesnt at the 
moment require standards track. But it does need an RFC. I am happy to 
debate standards track vs. ietf action.

That said, depending on the purpose, I don't think there is that much 
needed in such a spec. For example, for pic, something along the lines 
of "this purpose is meant for picture sharing between users. For 
example, in cases where a user with a cell phone snaps a picture during 
a call and wishes to send it to the other person, or wishes to send an 
existing file on disk. The received picture is normally rendered, 
possibly with user permission, and possibly saved by the recipient. All 
implementations MUST support image/jpg."

I'm not sure that much more is required; we could debate whether 
max-size needs to be dealt with, and that could be done any number of 
ways. The TOTE model would argue that you would do this by having a 
message from recipient to sender, over this TOTE connection, with the 
max size. Indeed, you could also have a message from sender to recipient 
first that indicates an interest in sending a picture right now, 
including picture metadata. This would imply that "pic" is really a 
three way handshake, two of which are some new messages we'd need to 
define (and presumably would be defined by the tote usage). We could 
alternatively send those params through SDP, but that constrains us to 
the O/A 2-way handshake; and as we have seen with things like SRTP, 
having the flexibility of building the protocol without the constraints 
of O/A is highly beneficial. It also means you can add new stuff without 
extending SIP itself.

What TOTE does is it avoids the need for this particular application to 
define how to get connections set up through sip, how to secure them, 
how to do nat traversal for them, how to signal what they are used for, 
how to negotiate them, and so on. It also gives us the ability to share 
connections across applications when it makes sense; this also allows us 
to have very rich multi-app communications in one session without this 
large number of connections.

And so in my mind, it lowers the bar for new applications by providing a 
framework for adding new ones without needing to change SIP, and to have 
the flexibility of engineering the application ideally for its 
particular needs.

I just submitted:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-ice-error-code-01.txt

This is nearly identical to a draft I submitted before Vancouver, but we 
never discussed. The basic idea here is to define a new SIP response 
code for the case when all ICE connectivity checks fail. THe main 
benefit is that proxies can log this and collect statistics on 
successful and failed ICE cases from the SIP messaging.

Comments welcome.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : The use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : F. Audet
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-sips-08.txt
	Pages           : 57
	Date            : 2008-02-23

This document provides clarifications and guidelines concerning the
use of the SIPS URI scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
It also makes normative changes to SIP.  This document also provides
a discussion of possible future steps in specification.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Requirements and Analysis of Media Security Management Protocols
	Author(s)       : D. Wing, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-media-security-requirements-03.txt
	Pages           : 48
	Date            : 2008-02-24

This document describes requirements for a protocol to negotiate a
security context for SIP-signaled SRTP media.  In addition to the
natural security requirements, this negotiation protocol must
interoperate well with SIP in certain ways.  A number of proposals
have been published and a summary of these proposals is in the
appendix of this document.

I just submitted a version -03 of media-security-requirements,
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-media-security-requirements
-03.txt


The major changes to the document include:

* After the discussion on the mailing list about R-REUSE, I have returned that
requirement to a MAY.


* Offline, Peter Schneider sent a detailed review of
draft-ietf-sip-media-security requirements.  Many of his comments were
resolved with new text or editorial changes, but a few of his comments
resulted in new or adjusted requirements.  He also had comments about R-REUSE
and suggested it should not be a MUST-level requirement.


* I added a new requirement, R-HERFP; there was existing discussion text
around handling HERFP correctly, but this creates a specific requirement:

   R-HERFP:
         The media security key management protocol MUST function
         securely even in the presence of HERFP behavior.


* To the discussion of the R-PSTN requirement, (which is unchanged and 
says "The media security key management protocol MUST support termination 
of media security in a PSTN gateway."), I added:

     It is desirable, even when one leg of a call is on the 
     PSTN, that the IP leg of the call be protected with SRTP.

This comment has some relationship with the active discussion (and I-D's) we
are have with RFC4474 and E.164 numbers, so this may need revision.  What I'm
trying to do is ensure we have SRTP on the IP leg, even if we know (or
suspect) the call is going across the PSTN.  There is no need to force RTP
over the IP leg of a call just because the call is going over the PSTN later.


* As mentioned above, R-REUSE has been returned to a MAY (it was only a MUST
in version -02 of the document):

   R-REUSE:
         The media security key management protocol MAY support the re-
         use of a previously established security context.

               Note: re-use of the security context does not imply 
               re-use of RTP parameters (e.g., payload type or SSRC).


* The R-AVOID-CLIPPING requirement now references Security Preconditions
rather than simply PRACK.


* Other changes can be seen by running rfcdiff,
http://www.tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff

This document provides clarifications and guidelines concerning the use =
of the SIPS URI scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
It also makes normative changes to SIP.  This document also provides a =
discussion of possible future steps in specification.

logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sips-08.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader =
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the =
Internet-Draft.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : J. Rosenberg
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-05.txt

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous
specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be
difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set
of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification serves
as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists the specifications under
the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups them into
categories.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

I just submitted an update to the hitchhikers guide:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-05.txt

This update reflects Keith's review after WGLC, addition of the last 
comments from WGLC, and addition of the normative call flows documents, 
which was an open issue from the previous draft.

Here is a table I put together that indicates the number of references 
in each version of this document:

Version	References
ind-00	85
sip-00	100
sip-01	104
sip-02	109
sip-03	112
sip-04	122
sip-05	140


Quite an increase over time.

Changes from -04:

* added draft-ietf-sipping-v6-transition to Minor Extensions added

* RFC4497 (QSIG to SIP) in PSTN interworking. ISUP to SIP was already
there.

* draft-ietf-sipping-gruu-reg-event added to event packages

* draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services added to URI Services
   section. Updated the descriptions of the URI list services specs to
   point to this.

* draft-ietf-sipping-consent-format added to security section. It
   comes in as a MIME object for SIP.

* added draft-ietf-mmusic-qos-identification to the QoS section

* added draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance to the emergency services
   section

* added draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse to minor extensions

* added draft-ietf-sipping-session-policy-framework

* added connected-identity (RFC4916) to security (was previously just
   in core). RFC4474 was in core and security, so it makes sense for
   4916 to mirror that

* added SIPS to security (was previously just in core)

* added draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-dtls to security

* security preconditions -> RFC 5027

* acr-code -> RFC 5079

* added draft-ietf-sip-body-handling to general infrastructure specs

* added draft-ietf-sip-domain-certs to security

* added draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy to security

* added ipv6-abnf-fix to the list of essential corrections

* added draft-ietf-sipping-pai-update as part of the description of
   rfc3325

* broadened slightly the scope of documents to include, so that BCPs
   which significantly clarify other normative specs are included. This
   adds:

    RFC3665: Basic call flow examples [core sip]
    RFC3666: PSTN call flows [PSTN interworking]
    RFC4579: CC conferencing [conferencing]

   Abstract:

   This document creates additional Session Initiation Protocol 
   Resource-Priority namespaces, and places these namespaces in the 
   IANA register.

As an editorial matter, can the abstract be made less vague?  Such as
mentioning that it creates a set of namespaces for the use of the US
Defense Information Systems Agency...

This document specifies how to use the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) to establish an Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
security context using the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
protocol.  It describes a mechanism of transporting a fingerprint
attribute in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) that identifies
the key that will be presented during the DTLS handshake.  It relies
on the SIP identity mechanism to ensure the integrity of the
fingerprint attribute.  The key exchange travels along the media path
as opposed to the signaling path.

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : An Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) Diff Event Package
	Author(s)       : J. Urpalainen
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-01.txt
	Pages           : 14
	Date            : 2008-02-24

This document describes an "xcap-diff" SIP event package, with the
aid of which clients can receive notifications of the partial changes
of Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
(XCAP) resources.  The initial synchronization and document updates
are based on using the XCAP-Diff format.

for the record, -10 of this ID will mimic what's at the location you 
suggest above

The ID will be submitted in 1-2 hours.  I'll send a note to the SIP 
list about it.

Hi Jonathan,
=20
The response code is ICE specific. But, couldn't it be useful at least
also for RFC4145, if one fails to establish a TCP connection?
=20
So, instead of "Connectivity Checks Failed" the text would be more
generic and say "Connectivity Failure", or something like that...
=20
Regards,

Subject: [Sip] I-D on ICE diagnostic error code



I just submitted:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-ice-error-code-0
1.txt

This is nearly identical to a draft I submitted before Vancouver, but we
never discussed. The basic idea here is to define a new SIP response
code for the case when all ICE connectivity checks fail. THe main
benefit is that proxies can log this and collect statistics on
successful and failed ICE cases from the SIP messaging.

Comments welcome.

Ok, I think I agree with you here. Each "purpose" would need to be  
very clearly specified, at roughly the same level of detail as is  
required for an event package or would be required for an INFO package  
if we were to go that way. And yes, the draft is a bit short on this  
right now.

[Chris Boulton] BUT then we are just recreating the Control Framework
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-fr
amework-01.txt) from the MediaCtrl work group - just called a different
name.  I'm not sure why we can't just use that.

Chris.

Sweet draft.

I would actually define the session-based IM usage for this first.  It would fix a lot of the NAT traversal issues we can't currently get around with MSRP. (the basic lesson being: don't put IP Addresses/ports in application layer messages when you don't need to)

Hadriel,

would you box block it since it travels along the media path?

Well, looking at draft-ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework-01.txt for the first time, I would say one reason is that the TOTE mechanism has a better chance of success in more environments.  At least across SBCs, if that matters to you. (it matters to me, obviously, but not everyone)

Also, TOTE is a lot lighter weight, although I'm sure after a few rounds of drafts with lots of people's inputs it will probably grow to be not far off. :)

Well, looking at draft-ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework-01.txt for
the first time, I would say one reason is that the TOTE mechanism has a
better chance of success in more environments.  At least across SBCs, if
that matters to you. (it matters to me, obviously, but not everyone)

[Chris Boulton] Which is exactly why the Control Framework needs
valuable input from RAI experts for the next revision (which is already
planned).  This is certainly an area that 'we'(mediactrl) have flagged
to look at for the next version of the Framework.  I certainly wouldn't
want to see yet another 'parallel fork' (that one is for Dean) in IETF
technology - especially as the Control Framework is the rarest of beasts
in the IETF in that it ACTUALLY has several 'running code'
implementations. 

Also, TOTE is a lot lighter weight, although I'm sure after a few rounds
of drafts with lots of people's inputs it will probably grow to be not
far off. :)

[Chris Boulton] hehehe - that made me smile.  Next you will be telling
me that SIP is a light weight protocol :-).

Chris,

Thanks for pointing this out - I hadn't looked at the 
mediactrl-framework before and there is definitely overlap and a 
relationship between it and TOTE.

Here is my analysis on the similarities and differences:

Both of them are about establishing connections between agents through 
an O/A exchange. Mediactrl uses comedia, whereas TOTE uses ICE-tcp. 
ICE-tcp will fall back to comedia when both sides are unnatted.

TOTE, however, provides a layer of demux within the SDP signaling, 
allowing for negotiation of what runs over the channel as part of the 
O/A negotiation. In mediactrl, this is done within the control channel 
itself, by doing a supported kind of exchange over the mediactrl protocol.

TOTE and media-ctrl framework both define a simple message protocol that 
runs over the connection. This is lighter weight in TOTE; its just for 
framing and purpose demux. mediactrl defines specific messages - 
control, report, synch, etc., transactions, response codes.

Mediactrl solves the problem of binding a connection to a dialog by 
defining a SYNC message. TOTE solves this problem by using ICE, which 
provides this correlation as part of its normal operations. Mediactrl 
solves the problem of keepalives using its own keepalive message; TOTE 
uses the ICE keepalive mechanism.

Since TOTE is a bit lower-layer than mediactrl, one model is to think of 
running mediactrl over TOTE. Mediactrl would then be a specific 
"purpose" parameter. When you do this, a bunch of features would get 
removed from mediactrl - all of the SDP stuff, connection establishment, 
synch mechanism. Mediactrl would continue to define the notion of 
control packages, control package negotiation, REPORT, CONTROl, response 
codes, transaction rules, etc.

I think thats a good story - instead of each and every protocol (like 
mediactrl) needing to worry about this lower-layer connection management 
and connectivity stuff, we solve it once, and provide a framework for 
reusing connections across different protocols and applications. So that 
one tcp connection between me and my media server could be used for 
mediactrl messages, streaming commands, picture transmission, etc.

Nope.  As I tried to explain a bit in the To/from uri changes draft, it's not that SBCs want to block such things, it's up to the owner of the SBC to decide whether to allow it or not.

I thought about that a bunch; I had planned a separate draft on how MSRP 
is different than session-mode IM over TOTE. The million dollar question 
is, what MSRP features would be lost and would we still need them. I've 
convinced myself that the key architectural difference - the use of turn 
for relays rather than an IM-specific relay, causes a very different 
inter-server connection model and has a huge impact on the functionality 
required in the protocol.

That said, I do think TOTE has a really good overall nat/sbc story. Its 
usage of ice-tcp will allow it to work reasonably well (with some amount 
of relaying...) with existing fw/nat. Whether it would work through 
existing SBCs depends a lot on what they do; whether they have the 
ability to pass unknown m-lines or not. However, more importantly, once 
an SBC does support TOTE, it would only need to support it once, and 
then from then on, all tote-based applications would work through the 
resulting connection (of course I have no doubt that SBCs would want to 
do per-purpose blocking/allowing but this becomes an issue of 
configuration and NOT software update; that is what I want to avoid).

Jonathan,
	Did you see my messages in this thread?  I raised several
issues with the approach you appear to be outlining again here, and I'm
wondering if you saw them.  To recapitulate just slightly:

The negotiation model appears inadequate to deal with MIME types
with significant parameters, with multipart MIME types, or with
MIME types that have "bucket" semantics (like message/cpim, the
container video types, or the 3ggp bucket mime types). 

Having a dispatch based on purpose without detailed specifications or
reference to specific applications seems to hit a middle ground that's
kind of nobody's sweet spot.  A specific application already has detailed
semantics that go beyond this purpose to actual decisions of whether
to render or store, user permissions needed, sizes accepted, etc;
generalized MIME transfer protocols like SMTP or HTTP already
use a different system for deciding which applications to invoke
when faced with a MIME object, and this forces systems with that
logic to have a parallel track.

The muxing seems liable to head of line blocking unless BEEP-like
channels are introduced.

This seems to re-purpose the deployed TURN servers in ways that
transform them into a generic NAT/Firewall avoidance mechanism
for any MIME type.  You're listing that as a feature.  Isn't there
a risk that security folks will see it as a bug?

				regards,
					Ted

Ted,

I did see your note. Dean had responded, and your response to him, I 
thought, indicated that you were satisfied that having purposes 
specified (which was the intent of the draft) addressed your concerns. 
Sorry for having misunderstood. Some responses below:

OK; this was just a -00. There are two ways to deal with that:

1. add the additional negotiation needed for this as new SDP parameters, or

2. don't bother at all with MIME negotiation as part of SDP for TOTE; 
rather, each purpose would have a protocol to doing the negotiations 
needed to make its functionality work. This avoids needing to do a 
general purpose MIME thing. FOr example, in the case of "pic", we'd 
actually define a little protocol that negotiates pictures sizes and 
supported types. In that applications, buckets and multiparts aren't an 
issue.

I'm inclined towards #2 actually. But note that, I put into TOTE exactly 
the same level of MIME negotiation that SIP itself provides. SO if it is 
grossly inadequate here, so it is there.

That was never the intent. The IANA considerations section states that 
these require specification.

That would seem to argue for pulling the MIME aspects out of TOTE.

This is discussed; if the purpose requires significant content, set it 
up as a separate session/tcp connection.

I think you are getting wrapped up in the MIME parts of this, which is 
not the main point. The main point is that there are lots of cases where 
we need UA to UA communications - see:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-sip-info-use-cases-00.txt

I was trying to provide a common mechanism for addressing those cases 
where we don't want to send all this garbage over SIP - we want it over 
the media plane. Are you objecting to that?

We just submitted revised versions of the DTLS-SRTP documents:

- draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework
- draft-ietf-avt-dtls-srtp

These include the following revisions:

- Harmonized our requirements evaluation with the current
  requirements doc.
- Added a requirement to generate a pilot STUN transaction
  to address the SBC latching issue
- Clarified the anonymity issue as discussed in YVR
- Required that the SDP offerer do actpass to deal with
  symmetry breaking issues
- Merged the material from draft-fischl-mmusic-* into
  these drafts Note that draft-fischl-mmusic-sdp-dtls is redundant and
  has been incorporated entirely into the other two drafts.
- Added a section on interactions with ICE
- Removed the use of the connection line from SDP
- A bunch of cleanups suggested by Flemming Andreasen

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional Event Notification
	Author(s)       : A. Niemi
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt
	Pages           : 24
	Date            : 2008-02-25

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables
receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP
user agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating,
refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and
periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures have a serious
deficiency in that they provide no tools to avoid replaying event
notifications that have already been received by a user agent.  This
memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to
condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed
since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition
is true, either the body of a resulting event notification or the
entire notification message is suppressed.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I think this is an implementation issue. But really, the notifier
shouldn't be generating a new entity-tag, if the entity hasn't changed. 

I think the model already talks about this. A resource can have several
*different* representations, each of which also has its own private pool
of entity-tags.

This is fixed in -02. Now, the condition applies to all subsequent
notifications.

No I really meant copies. I guess this could be said differently, but I
like my way better. ;)

The wildcard is better motivated now, I think.

No, it's not zero; the expires is zero because it's a "fetch". The poll
interval is the time between successive fetches. That can be anything
the subscriber wants.

Well, these are not in priority order.

This would cause the entity to change, no?

It should get a new NOTIFY that reports the latest state.

The model tries to take privacy filtering into account with the concept
of representations. In effect, each possible variation of the resource
state due to privacy filters being applied and whatnot, is a unique
representation that has it's own entity-tag pool. Notifications are only
generated for this representation, when actual reportable changes
trickle through the filters. At this point, a new entity-tag would be
generated as well.

If the model isn't clear on this, I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks for the review!

Done.

Yes, but if the same entity-tag was given to a subscriber in the past,
how would the notifier know which one the subscriber is using?

Right, generating unique entity-tags doesn't require much more than
this. The extra information can be a timestamp and the resource URI for
instance. That would already fulfill the uniqueness property.

You're correct. The new draft version does exactly this but in another
way, i.e., there is now only one header field that does all that the
previous two did separately.

This was probably a little too sci-fi. I've removed the text.

I believe the draft says exactly this. Can you point to specific text
that needs fixing?

A timestamp is a good idea in any case, given the uniqueness requirement
for an etag.

I'm reluctant to specifying any fixed (normative or otherwise)
specification of the entity-tag, but to leave it as an implementation
detail. Implementors don't need help here, and are likely to come up
with a better one that suits them better anyway.

The way this needs to work for the subscriber is that a new NOTIFY
always resets the entity. I added a sentence on this based on Brian's
comments. Still, if you think this needs to be more explicit, I'm open
to suggestions.

Possible in theory, but in reality, how likely is it that this will be a
problem?

I just find it an incredibly bad idea to build a system that behaves
this way.

Hmm... Good point. AFAICS, this should work as-is with REFER
subscriptions as well. I added this to section 4: 

        The conditional notification mechanism is independent of the
        way in which subscriptions are installed. In other words, the
        mechanism supports implicit subscriptions, such as those
        associated with the <xref target="RFC3515">REFER
        method</xref>.

Fixed.

Thanks for the review!

The subscriber really need not know. It is the notifier's responsibility
to keep the entity-tags unique across all of the insanely difficult SIP
routing that it may deploy in front of it.

Correct.

This isn't the subscriber's problem. Moreover, I really doubt that it is
even feasible to build a system where a new subscription sent to the
same AoR will randomly reach a different notifier instance that is in no
way synchronized (as in state, entity-tag values, etc) with the other
instances.

Section 4 defines the entity to include the Event header field, which
includes all of the parameters.

Yes it is. A PUBLISH request will succeed (with a 2xx) or fail (412)
based on the condition; whereas a SUBSCRIBE will always succeed (with a
2xx) regardless of whether the "suppress" condition is true or not. This
is because the condition only affects the NOTIFYs that follow.

This document defines an extension to the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) to convey geographic location information from one 
   SIP entity to another SIP entity.  The extension covers end to end 
   conveyance as well as location-based routing, where proxy servers 
   make routing decisions based on the location of the SIP user agents.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : C. Jennings, R. Mahy
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-outbound-12.txt
	Pages           : 50
	Date            : 2008-02-25

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to
initiate TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User
Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, many practical
considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network
Address Translators (NATs), prevent servers from connecting to User
Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User
Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be
delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It
also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open
and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent
to its Registrar.

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-12.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

   well, at least I didn't overstate things...  ;-)

   I can change this if you want me to

I've been sick and perhaps my message was a little short.  But when I
read the abstract, I realized that if I didn't already know what the
I-D was about, the abstract really wouldn't tell me.  It would be even
clearer to say something like "This document creates 40 additional SIP
... for the use of DISA."  But that might sound snarky, as people have
wondered what so many namespaces are needed for.

Few questions/clarifications:

Should there be a "content-disposition: recipient-list" header
included in the SUBSCRIBE?

When a SUBSCRIBE is refreshed, should the body sent again?

Is there a way to change the subscription if different body will be sent
in subsequent SUBSCRIBE?

Thanks

[Sip] I-D Action:draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-01.txt






A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group 
of the IETF.


                 Title           : An Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) Diff Event Package
                 Author(s)       : J. Urpalainen
                 Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-01.txt
                 Pages           : 14
                 Date            : 2008-02-24

This document describes an "xcap-diff" SIP event package, with the
aid of which clients can receive notifications of the partial changes
of Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
(XCAP) resources.  The initial synchronization and document updates
are based on using the XCAP-Diff format.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-01.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then
                 "get draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
                 mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
                 "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-01.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
                 MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use 
this
                 feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the 
"FILE"
                 command.  To decode the response(s), you will need 
"munpack" or
                 a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant 
mail readers
                 exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
                 "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been 
split
                 up into multiple messages), so check your local 
documentation on
                 how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Thanks for putting this together.

I'll add another to your list. This is more of an enterprise thing, but 
oftentimes the From URI is changed because the caller identity needs to 
be set to the attendant number before going to another domain. For 
example, if anyone within example.com makes a call, and that call 
remains within example.com, the caller ID is unchanged. But if the 
request exits the domain, the display name is often changed (Example 
Org.) and the number is changed to the direct number for example.com. I 
personally think this practice is an artifact of days long gone but it 
remains common.

Dan asked me to write up a draft on it, in case people are interested.  This is the draft:

For posterity, I have updated the info-use-cases draft to fix some errors and include MSML.
I don't expect this draft to go anywhere, since it has served its purpose, but wanted to get it right for Google's memory banks. (for when it becomes self-aware in 2029)

Howdy,
The info-events draft has been updated with the following major changes (mostly based on Adam's comments):
Incorporated RFC 2976 and changed the draft to replace it. (lots of changes there)
Changed terminology to be "Info Packages" and changed header names.
Added section on applicability, based on Eric's info draft.
Added section on legacy use.
Added section on requirements for defining a new Info Package.
Changed BNF, but it's still not right yet.
Other minor changes/edits based on mailing list comments.

Known issues brought up on mailing list still open for SIP-WG discussion/decision:
Whether to include Info-Packages in OPTIONS and REGISTER.
Whether to have delayed package negotiation, for 3PCC cases.
Whether to have re-Invite/Update re-negotiate packages.
How to deal with overlapping or out-of-order INFO requests, if at all.
What the response code should be for not-understood INFO.

Yeah good point - it is what I would include under number translation I guess.  Providers do it too in a way, when they remove internal routing prefix codes or "*" codes, fwiw.

well, no. This is about sending a flat uri-list about "interesting" 
xcap-resources to a single server (closely coupled with the 
xcap-server).  And also of course about syncing with this single server.

right, even with conditional re-subscriptions where the server returns a 
full response if there's no match in "etag" values.

you may change the subscription body with any re-subscribe, so that the 
client stamps all previous state as stale.

Having body always is imo simpler and more consistent with conditional 
re-subscriptions, no ? And also body-content is presumably  anyways  
pretty small.

br, jari

ps. there were minor changes from 00 version, some missing Accept-header 
and some text about  Aki's subnotetags.

Hi,

I have submitted a new version of draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags. I've sat
on my hands for months on this, and I apologize for that.

This version clears the backlog of the WGLC comments from late last
year. I've sent replies to those comments separately. 

The biggest change is that the draft now joins together the two
previously separate header fields (Suppress-Notify-If-Match and
Suppress-Body-If-Match) and behaviors into a single header field
(Suppress-If-Match) and behavior, as was suggested by Jonathan
Rosenberg. 

I think this draft is about ready for publication, but as the diff to
the previous version is non-trivial, perhaps another WGLC is in order.
But I let the chairs speak on that.

Cheers,
Aki

Subject: [Sip] I-D Action:draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.


	Title           : An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) Events for Conditional Event Notification
	Author(s)       : A. Niemi
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt
	Pages           : 24
	Date            : 2008-02-25

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving
asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents.
This framework defines the procedures for creating, refreshing and
terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and periodic polling of
resource state.  These procedures have a serious deficiency in that they
provide no tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have
already been received by a user agent.  This memo defines an extension
to SIP events that allows the subscriber to condition the subscription
request to whether the state has changed since the previous notification
was received.  When such a condition is true, either the body of a
resulting event notification or the entire notification message is
suppressed.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Well... I can easily put the purpose of the namespaces in, to 
differentiated it from future IANA registrations of RP 
namespaces.  I'll submit this in two weeks, when we're out of the 
blackout period. This is easy.

A draft agenda follows. This is a VERY draft agenda, since it's about  
5 hours long and we currently have only 2 hour of meeting time.

Note that this has a new format: it includes markup as to whether each  
item is chartered (I was getting questioned on this) and a status  
column.

Please review carefully and let me know if you'd like to volunteer to  
give up a time slot, or if other changes are needed.

Agenda also posted on Softarmor and IETF sites.

   The subscriber really need not know. It is the notifier's responsibility
   to keep the entity-tags unique across all of the insanely difficult SIP
   routing that it may deploy in front of it.

The notifier cannot know what routing is in front of it, because it
cannot know what URIs might route to it.

   Correct.

   This isn't the subscriber's problem. Moreover, I really doubt that it is
   even feasible to build a system where a new subscription sent to the
   same AoR will randomly reach a different notifier instance that is in no
   way synchronized (as in state, entity-tag values, etc) with the other
   instances.

There is no requirement that the SUBSCRIBE was sent to an "AoR" (even
if that term was well-defined).

It is trivial to build a system where a new subscription could go to a
place that is much different than a previous subscription:

sip:a.example.com forwards to sip:b.example.com - I think of this as
"my call center".  What I don't know is:

sip:b.example.com uses time-of-day-based routing to forward to either
sip:c1.example.com or sip:c2.example.com - My company has outsourced
the call center to two different companies in in two different places,
one for the day shift and one for the night shift.

sip:c1.example.com parallel-forks to sip:d1a.example.com and
sip:d1b.example.com - The day-shift call center workers are in several
locations.

sip:c2.example.com parallel-forks to sip:d2a.example.com and
sip:d2b.example.com - And so are the night-shift call center workers.

OK, now I send "SUBSCRIBE sip:a.example.com".  Unless I know the
details of the above routing, there's no way for me to know that the
routing changes with time.  Similarly, there's no way for the
notifiers at d1a.example.com, d1b.example.com, d2a.example.com, and
d2a.example.com to even know what notifiers they *might* have to
synchronize with.

>A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-10.txt

This is a list of changes to Conveyance -10 that might not be so 
obvious, since a fair amount of the text was streamlined or just 
changed (meaning any diff won't point at these changes only):

- moved Conventions and (the new) terminology section in front
   of the Introduction section -- so that readers know the terms
   and acronyms before the Intro.

- removed the ability to provide granular CAtype indications in the
   locationErrorValue (to several people's relief!)

- modified all mentioning of "Location-by-Reference" and
   "by-reference" to "LbyR" throughout the doc, for consistency

- modified all mentioning of "Location-by-Value" and "by-Value"
   to "LbyV" throughout the doc, for consistency

- created a brand new errors section. All (17 previous) errors were
   distilled down to 5 actionable responses by a location error
   recipient essentially meaning:

       - General error
           - similar to SIP 400 response
      - retry later, with same data
          - no retry-after indicator though
       - retry later, once device has refreshed data
           - no retry-after indicator though
      - user permission to reveal location necessary to succeed
      - Denial error (active denial of location supplied in
        request)
          - similar to 6XX in SIP
    - each are defined and actions articulated, as well as
      non-actions and misunderstandings are articulated
    - created the ability for each action to have a range of error
    codes, such as 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, and 5XX ranges - but that
      is left for future efforts
    - consequence of fewer errors is the inability to indicate URI
      scheme not supported (specifically, sips: and pres:)

- greatly shortened section 3 (Conveyance Overview) to not have
   2119 language. Moved remaining text to section 4.

- clarified Geolocation-Error header can be in any non-100
   response

- clarified role of 424 (Bad Location Information)

- removed all references to "recipient=" parameter within the
   Geolocation header

- created new IANA registry for Location Reference URI (schemes),
   and register 3 schemes with this doc (sip:, sips:, and pres:)

- corrected the IANA registration of "Header Field Parameters
   and Parameter Values" for both the Geolocation and
   Geolocation-Error headers (thanks Adam Roach!)

- fixed the Geolocation-Error ABNF (thanks Paul Kyzivat!)

- changed all usage of "per <RFC>" to "as defined in <RFC>"

Hi Dan

a quick comment on this draft...

There is no discussion of what happens when there is a validation =
failure. While obvious, you should probably reference 4474 processing =
upon validation failure (i.e. respond with 438 'Invalid Identity =
Header'). And while on the topic in your second example where the cert =
comparison test fails your diagram still shows the call proceeding to =
its destination (hence the earlier comment).

$Id: draft-kupwade-sip-iba-00-rev.txt,v 1.1 2008/02/27 00:16:00 ekr Exp $

SIP has seen several attempts to use cryptographic signatures
to provide data origin authentication for SIP messages:

- RFC 3261 provided for S/MIME digital signatures by the
  end-user.
- RFC 4474 provided for "Identity" signatures by an 
  authentication proxy.

The RFC 3261 S/MIME scheme has seen almost no deployment.  This was
generally attributed to the difficulty of users obtaining
certificates. RFC 4474 was explicitly designed to avoid end-user
certs and is comparatively new so we don't know what kind
of deployment it will see.

This document describes an alternate mechanism using "Identity Based
Signatures". This is a little complicated to explain, but here's
the basic overview:

In a conventional asymmetric (public key) scheme, you
generate your own key pair, consisting of a public key and
a private key. Then when someone wants to encrypt to you,
they encrypt under your public key and you decrypt with
the private key. But how do people get your public key,
and how do they know it's yours? That's what certificates
are for. A certificate, of course, is a credential that
binds your name to your public key. But this is all kind of
inconvenient if you want to encrypt to someone who you've
never talked to before, because you need to get their certificate,
which brings up directory issues.

Identity-Based Encryption is a scheme that does without
the certificates. The idea is that you have two algorithms:

- P(string) which converts any string into a public key
- p(string, K) which converts any string into its corresponding
  private key.

K, of course, is a secret master parameter. So, instead of 
having a certificate authority you have a key generator (KG)
which knows K. KG's policy is only to issue private key
p(<name>, K) to the owner of <name> (this is the same
policy as the CA would have, of course). 

So, when you want to encrypt to "alice@example.com" you encrypt
to P("alice@example.com") secure in the knowledge that only
Alice could have gotten the private key. The nice thing about
this is that there is no need to have a certificate directory
because the public key is directly computable from the 
SIP URI. Where this seems useful is in settings where you
want to encrypt to people you have had no prior contact
with, like e-mail.
(more on this at
http://www.rtfm.com/movabletype/archives/2003_07.html#000315).

Unsurprisingly, IBE has a signature variant. In a conventional
public key system, when you want to sign a message you send
along [Message, Signature, Certificate]. The recipient extracts
your public key from the certificate and then verifies the
signature. In Identity Based Signatures (IBS), you can
do without the cert: the sender just send
[Message, Signature, Identity] since the receiver can compute
the public key directly from the Identity.

It shouldn't be hard to see that this is a lot less interesting
than IBE, since pretty much by definition the verifier is
reading a message from the signer and so the signer can
include a copy of (or a reference to) his certificate.
So, all this really does is provide a bit of message compression.

With all that in mind, this document describes how to use a
variant of Identity Based Signatures with SIP Identity.
Now, I've oversimplified a little bit, because there are
two other features it uses (neither of which are actually
that desirable).

- "Signcryption". When Alice sends a message to Bob, she
  can structure her signature so that only Bob can verify
  it. This pretty clearly interacts badly with retargeting.
- Hierarchical IBS. The system I described has only one
  key generator, but it's possible to use crypto to delegate
  authority so that there is a central KG which delegates
  "example.com" to one sub-KG and "example.org" to another.
  This doesn't make a lot of sense in an RFC4474 environment
  since there's only one key for any domain anyway.

The only thing that this document really does is allow you
to avoid having to have the trivial Web site RFC 4474 requires
you to have (or contract for) to stick your certificate on.
However, when you weigh that against the fact that the number
of CAs issuing identity-based signature keys currently stands
at 0, that seems to be a pretty marginal advantage.

Harsh, Dean,

Thanks much for this document. Its great to see folks trying to tackle 
new areas of work, especially tough ones like identity.

The concept of identity based security is a new one to me; how mature is 
this stuff? Are there any commercial uses yet? What about intellectual 
property issues? Has it been well-studied by experts to assess its 
robustness? i.e., have folks been trying to crack it, and so far its 
held up?

The document talks about encrypting the signature for the target but I 
don't see what security benefit this brings. Indeed, encrypting content 
in the signaling for an intended target has proven very problematic. 
Besides the (so-far) hugely hard cert problem, there is also the issue 
of retargeting. Also you have cases of multiple receiving devices - 
forking for example. Maybe Dean is just hoping it goes away, but how 
would this solution work there? Then there are things like shared lines, 
  contact centers, etc...

I agree with Ekr that the primary advantage from a pure signature 
perspective is the ability to eliminate the fetching of the certificate. 
I think this is more beneficial than just 'compression'. Identity-Info 
presents the certificate by reference. The increasing numbers of NAT and 
firewalls and SBCs are making me increasingly worried that the ability 
to reach across the network, back to the originator, and fetch ANYTHING 
over http, will be really hard in SIP deployments. So there is value in 
eliminating this IMHO.

I must say I didn't understand how revocation works. From the 
description of the algorithm it seemed untenable. The verifier never 
needs to obtain a cert and the public key is generated statically from 
the identity. Once they have the private key, the sender can always sign 
with it, so I don't see how revocation is possible.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Well, my pairing based cryptography expert friends tell me
that the algorithms in this draft are pretty far off the current
state of the art, which would be something from the Boneh-Boyen
family. BB is pretty well regarded.

Yes:
www.voltage.com
www.identum.com

(full disclosure: I'm on Voltage's TAB).

> property issues?

Yes, there are a number of patents in the field. I don't know about
these specific algorithms, but given that they post-date the
original Boneh-Franklin IBE patent, it wouldn't be surprising
if they were covered by patents. Dean?

Yes, at least for the Boneh-Franklin and Boneh-Boyen stuff.
As with all modern algorithms, there are security reductions
to some assumed hard problem. HArd to know how much that
should comfort you.

Sure, but we could just shove the certificate into the message
in a new header or in the body, at which point we are talking
about compression. Moreover, there's no requirement that the
certificate be on the UAC's machine. If people care about this,
then it seems pretty likely that the CA can operate a site
which hosts your certificate for you. This is especially true
when we're talking about one certificate per domain as assumed
by RFC 4474.

The way this is done is with what's effectively short-lived
identities (you could do the same thing with short-lived
certificates) you treat the time as part of the identity.
E.g., you might be "jdrosen@cisco.com:March-April, 2008". So,
the user needs to periodically refresh his private key to match
the new identity. If the key has been revoked you don't issue
new keys.

Badly, most probably. I've suggested a breakout on e.164 identity to  
AD Cullen, and he is pushing back on the idea, as it has the potential  
to be full of sound and fury but signify nothing. It's not chartered,  
and it might not be productive to just get into a bunch of shouting  
matches.

Perhaps you folks have some suggestions on how these things could be  
covered effectively in a meeting?

We expect to have IPR on some related material, but I don't believe it  
is required for the subject discussed in the draft.

There are rumors that Boneh's folks have a lot of IPR in the area.

The real benefit is not just the elimination of cert-fetching, but the  
reduction of effort for cert validation. The entire validation tree is  
essentially encoded in the mathematics. If it works at all, the key  
was "good" (which doesn't say anything about whether it has been  
compromised and/or revoked).

There's also some benefit to using time-limited identities to reduce  
the massive problem of CRL management.

Here's a novel thing:

Let's say I know your identity is sip:ekr@networkresonance.com, and  
that your relationship with the PKG allows you to retrieve keys for  
parameterized versions of that identity.

I can construct a new cryptographic identity for you, perhaps "sip:ekr@networkresonance.com;ID=2009121222 
" and use that to sign a message to you. You've never seen this  
identity before and don't yet even have the private key for it. You  
then go to your PKG and retrieve said key and use it to verify the  
message.

I didn't need to check a CRL (or worry about known-text attacks, etc.)  
for your cert, because I in effect forced the creation of a new one.

Right, that's a variation of the technique I outlined above.

If one has a convention for encoding the duration into the identity,  
then it can be made to work very smoothly.

I'm sorry, but this is just not convincing.

1. The computational cost to do the certificate validation is
   trivial.
2. You have to have the code in your system to do TLS anyway.
3. The "one big KG in the sky" scheme that you describe is
   not one that anyone I know in the IBE world thinks is
   plausible. In fact, if you look at Voltage's system
   (see draft-ietf-smime-ibearch), they use a system where
   each domain has their own KG and certificates are used
   to authenticate the KG (full disclosure: US Patent 7017181)

Which is equally possible with certificates.

Yes, this is a commonly discussed in the IBE world, but it doesn't
work as well with store-and-forward signature systems because the
relying party has no opportunity to insist that you provide an
identity of his choice.

known-text attacks? What are you talking about?

And of course, this is equally compatible with cert-based systems.
The reason people don't do it is it's an enormous pain.

Oh, I should mention: what's the value of needing a new key to
*verify* the message? What does that do for the sender?
The relying party can simply assume the signature is valid.
If the sender wants to force the recipient to have a new 
key, they need to encipher the whole message or require
a signed receipt from the recipient.

Hi All,

Can supported header contains like timer or any other option tag without
(RFC3262Tag)100rel and can require header contain rfc3262tag(100rel)?

Is that mandatory INVITE request should contain supported and require header
with 100rel option tag?

Eg: Supported: Timer
    Require: 100rel
The above example is ok to be in INVITE request

Any response is highly appreciated.

Thanks,
Sudhir

Cool.
So if I understand this right (and I probably don't), ignoring rfc4474 identity and IBS for a moment and instead thinking about SRTP and IBE: I could use IBE to encrypt the security-descriptions attribute value using the intended target's SIP URI as a key, and only someone owning that URI (and sharing the same KG) or the KG itself could decrypt it to learn the sec-desc cleartext to use?

-hadriel
p.s. the KG would actually be a problem for IBE, wouldn't it?  I mean the KG can always decrypt it. (at which point they would be the Key Generator Backdoor - aka, the KGB ;)

Then that's bad. How does the notifier then know which PIDF to pick in

I agree this kind of setup presents a problem. But I also think that
what we're dealing with here is not that different from the web world.
There are a lot of load balancing schemes that can be used with HTTP,
which result in a GET ending up in different data centers in different
parts of the world at different times.

What's important to note there is that if the service that is accessed
via this GET needs sessions and gives out cookies, then the backend
system needs to be synchronized. Otherwise, the servers will be unaware
of each others cookies, and the service won't work correctly.

Similarly, the backend to the SIP notifiers needs a synchronized
backend, otherwise, subnot-etags won't work.  Naturally, the etags just
like cookies can be constructed in such a way that they contain the
necessary state.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi all,

       I am Pavan.I am working on implementing security features for SIP on
a Voip enabled phone.\
1) I am bit confused with the implementation of "sips" scheme and the
necessary changes to be made in the sip headers to make them comply with
sips scheme.
2) How to transport sip/sips messages over NAT or Firewall??

Any help in this regard will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks & Regards

Here are some comments to the TOTE draft:

1. In the Introduction the draft mentions three general purpose 
mechanisms that allow a pair of agents to communicate data during a 
session. However it fails to name the most relevant work for this draft, 
which is the file transfer mechanism, an MMUSIC WG item:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-file-transfer-mech-06.txt

2. Then, I believe most of what the draft proposes can be done with the 
above draft. For good or for bad, the file transfer mechanism does not 
really define a new file transfer protocol as TOTE does, but reuses the 
existing MSRP.

3. I don't think I have seen the requirements for this draft. So, I 
cannot really evaluate why the file transfer mechanism is able to meet 
these requirements, and I cannot evaluate if MSRP is able to meet these 
requirements. The requirements corresponding to the file transfer 
mechanism were posted way back in this draft:
http://tools.ietf.org/draft/draft-isomaki-sipping-file-transfer/draft-isomaki-sipping-file-transfer-01.txt

4. Assuming that there is a need for a new protocol for transferring 
files between to endpoints, I would encourage to re-use existing work. 
In particular, the file transfer mechanism says:

       In principle it is possible to use the SDP extensions defined here
       and replace MSRP with any other similar protocol that can carry
       MIME objects.  This kind of specification can be written as a
       separate document if the need arises.  Essentially, such protocol
       should be able to be negotiated on an SDP offer/answer exchange
       (RFC 3264 [RFC3264]), be able to carry MIME objects between two
       endpoints, and use a reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP).

For what I read, TOTE will qualify for such alternative protocol, but 
again, we need to understand the requirements that makes the need for 
yet another file transfer protocol.

5. On a slightly different topic. The draft also mentions Shared 
Browsing. I have recently put a draft that describes how to do 
collaboration between endpoints, and one of the topics is Shared 
Browsing. The draft is this one:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-garcia-mmusic-sdp-collaboration-00.txt

Section 4.2 discusses the topic, and proposes to use the file transfer 
mechanism for sending those URL objects between endpoints.

6. I've been told that in German language TOTE means DEATH, so, perhaps 
that name should be changed.

So, all in all, I think we need more discussion on the requirements with 
respect existing work, and try to identify the delta that makes the need 
for this draft.

Hi Pavan,

Not sure abt the 1st part of ur questions...but regarding point 2 I have
some suggestions:
1) Not sure what you mean by how to transport ??....but here I assume that u
r concerned about how the packets will be seen in the REAL world. There are
several options
a) Clients can have STUN support, which will make clients transparent of any
NAT traversal
b) Proxies can be sip-outbound-draft compliant...this will take care of
routing based on actuall src IP:Port overriding 3261 based approach (routing
request based on Contact/Route hdr etc ..).
c) Your network can have a ALG , just outside NAT box.....this ALG needs to
be SIP aware and should do all the header re-writings. Unfortunately no
standard exists as such ..but some googling may help

Hi Pavan
=20
For question 1) implementing sips means implementing TLS. So the SIP
stack would use SIP over TLS/TCP or DTLS over UDP. Then the URI would be
sips: Refer to RFC 3261 for more details about which flags / headers
need to changed.
I think transportation of either sip or sips messages over NAT/Firewall
remains almost same. For more details on SIP over NAT refer to RFC 3489
which explains STUN (Simple Traversal of Udp over NAT).

Hi all,
=20
       I am Pavan.I am working on implementing security features for SIP
on a Voip enabled phone.\
1) I am bit confused with the implementation of "sips" scheme and the
necessary changes to be made in the sip headers to make them comply with
sips scheme.
2) How to transport sip/sips messages over NAT or Firewall??

Any help in this regard will be greatly appreciated.

DY> Thanks for continuing to maintain this document.  I know it has  
been very useful for a number of people just starting to learn about  
SIP (they have indicated this to me some time after I referred them  
to it).

DY> Quite a number!  And it's no wonder that it's so hard to answer  
the question "how do I implement SIP?" when someone asks that.  It  
would be fun if your table also had the dates of those various drafts  
to see the growth as a function of time.

DY> One other suggestion - I realize it's not a *specification*, but  
RFC 5039 by you and Cullen about the issues around the potential of  
spam for SIP is one that I would add to the "security" section.   
While it doesn't go into detail on specific solutions, it does make  
people aware of the issues they need to be thinking about when  
implementing SIP solutions.  I would suggest that RFC 5039 could be  
added now and then replaced later as RFCs emerge with actual  
solutions (or steps toward solutions).  Just a thought.

Thanks for your work on this,
Dan

Yeah. This is how Voltage's email system works. (Seriously,
read the blog post I pointed at, whcih explains all this).
But of course this doesn't work correctly with a bunch of
retargeting scenarios. This is basically orthogonal to
MIKEY RSA mdoe, except that instead of doing certificate
retrieval you need to do parameter retrieval, and only
once for the domain.

Another sort-of-weird feature here is that you can encrypt to
someone who hasn't registered with the system, and then
they can register *afterward*. That works with email but
of course is too slow for VoIP.

Yeah. This feature is generally referred to as "escrow" and is
one of the reasons why people don't want to have a single 
global KG.

Key escrow problem has been tackled using B. Lee et. als algorithm.  They propose a single Private key generator who would perform the identity check and multiple KPAs (Key Privacy Authorities) who would distribute the partial private key.

Yeah. This is how Voltage's email system works. (Seriously,
read the blog post I pointed at, whcih explains all this).
But of course this doesn't work correctly with a bunch of
retargeting scenarios. This is basically orthogonal to
MIKEY RSA mdoe, except that instead of doing certificate
retrieval you need to do parameter retrieval, and only
once for the domain.

Another sort-of-weird feature here is that you can encrypt to
someone who hasn't registered with the system, and then
they can register *afterward*. That works with email but
of course is too slow for VoIP.

Yeah. This feature is generally referred to as "escrow" and is
one of the reasons why people don't want to have a single 
global KG.

naive question

what burden does this put on a peer (or all peers) to (conceivably) 
have to constantly discover JDR's public key, for example (because 
they don't know how long the private key is good for)?

Or is this problem known/expected or solved easily already?

I don't see how this really solves the problem. Obviously,
at a large cost you can have multiple KGs such that all of
them need to cheat in order to recover the message content,
but that doesn't really solve the problem. As the paper
you cite indicates, lawful intercept can be performed by
subpoenaing all the KGs.

Now, I'm not saying that escrow is necessarily bad, but
that just that this doesn't remove it.

Well, the feature of IBE schemes is that once you have the public
parameters for the KG, you can compute the public key without
fetching further data from the CA/KG. This is a lot more interesting
for encryption than it is for signature, since, as I said, you
can force the signer to just send you a new certificate, so the
retrieval cost is minimized.

Forcing a signer to send a certificate is fine, but if the signers root CA is not same as the receivers root CAs, then the receiver has to go through a complex path construction process which is not a trivial problem.

Huh? The entire Web security system operates on the principle that you
can verify certificates from random CAs. This has not turned out to be
a serious problem in practice.

Moreover, *exactly* the same problem exists wrt the KG in identity-based
systems.

How can we verify a certificate from a random CA? It will definitely be a serious threat in the near future. 
   
  Self signed certificates are not very reliable either. 
     

   A malicious KG is equivalent to a malicious CA. A malicious CA can also tag a public key to a different user and pose the same threat level.

Huh? The entire Web security system operates on the principle that you
can verify certificates from random CAs. This has not turned out to be
a serious problem in practice.
   
  

Moreover, *exactly* the same problem exists wrt the KG in identity-based
systems.

A malicious CA has to mount MITM attacks on all your traffic
in order to decrypt. A malicious KG can passively decrypt.

Again, some people view escrow as a feature, but its simply

What if the trust anchors are not complied into your client? Then verifying a digital signature is not a trivial problem. 
   
  Cross certificate validation is a challenging issue?

Which is why nobody does it in practice in the private sector.

In any case, I'm not sure why we're having this discusion since
all the same trust issues apply to IBE schemes. The only respect
in which they don't apply to IBE schemes is if you have a single
global KG, but of course you could have a single global CA,
too. It's just that nobody wants to do either.

Rather than "for the use of" I would prefer "to meet the requirements
of".

The usage of any namespace is a private matter between the operator of
the SIP entities, and the user. The fact that DISA requested such a set
of namespaces does not reserve usage to that particular organisation.
Rather it defines a particular set of priority and preemption schemes
that anyone can use.

Keith

I think this was what I was asking about... and it appears as if it

right, it doesn't prevent anyone from using the namespaces

Dean I agree with your underlying notion that at this point in time any
discussion of the underlying problems in E164 and identity could be
potentially counter productive.

The RAI schedule in Philadelphia is already overbooked as it is ..It may
take a separate hour or more BOF in Dublin to just scope out the problem.

Its better to try and peal these issues off into some separate task group or
something in order to let the rest of the SIP WG to proceed with its usual
overcrowded work load.

I'd be interested in seeing more on how #2 works.  One of my concerns
with "pic", to take one example, is how a very generic purpose like
trading images gets used by applications that want it.  How does a
system know when a pic being sent from one side of the TOTE exchange
to the other is meant as a new user icon, an avatar for a MMORPG, or
a stand-alone picture relevant to some ongoing exchange on a
real time channel?  If there is more interaction than just "purpose"
and mime type, then re-use of this by applications that want the facility
may work.  Otherwise, it seems you are either going to head towards
purposes like "vnd.WoW" that have no generality or you are going
to get what amounts to a least-common-denominator application.
The "I can send you my name" application is not really too compelling.

What you have there now is:

   However, if a purpose represents a
   significant amount of data, such that head-of-line blocking might
   occur between purposes, an agent SHOULD utilize a separate TOTE
   session for that purpose.

I guess this still worries me.  If an application wants to set up a TOTE
connection with an existing peer, I'm guessing it will need to decide
whether to re-use an exiting session or set up a new one.   While it
may have a sense of whether it will have large amounts of data to
send, it doesn't have any idea of the sensitivity to head of line
blocking from the other users of the connection.  That pushes the
decision into the agent which knows something about both.
But that ends up requiring a lot of knowledge of the protocol
usage characteristics of the using application which go beyond
what TOTE will carry on the wire (some uses of "pic" with image/jpeg
are really highly unlikely to cause head of line blocking; others might be a
real clog).

Defaulting to non-muxed connections eliminates that, of course,
but removes one of the benefits you propose.

A number of your purposes seem pretty far outside the info-use-cases
draft, and the level of generality does raise issues.  Maybe I am
too concerned with the "generic MIME transport" aspects of this,
but I think replacing INFO with a media plane solution that
does not have at least the level of specificity of event packages
is not helpful and may even be harmful.  I'll try to corner you
in Philadelphia to discuss this in person,  especially on your
"little protocol" proposal above.  There may be an opportunity
there.

Well, I'm thinking on my feet here, but for picture sharing, something 
like this:

A->B INVITE tote session, purpose=pic
B->A 200 OK tote, purpose=pic
A->B ACK

A->B [TOTE] I support jpg, png. Screen resolution here is just 100x200, 
8 bits color.
B->A [TOTE] I support just jpg, but I have a huge screen so up to 
1000x1000 is fine. 24 bits color.

and then later:

A->B [TOTE] Hey I'd like to send a picture, 200x200, jpg, 8 bits color. 
 From the camera. OK?
B  (prompts user, "Joe would like to send you a photo. Accept?". user 
accepts)
B->A [TOTE] yes proceed
A->B [TOTE] sends image
B->A [TOTE] file received


Again, thinking on my feet here.

I see your concern. I think the main criteria is that, this is used when 
the primary purpose is to render an image to the recipient, and allow 
them the option to save. Since a part of this is rendering you need to 
think about screen sizes, colors and so on to make sure the image is in 
a form that can be processed by the recipient for rendering. So anything 
that needs this - negotiation of picture sizes for immediate rendering - 
could use it. Primary application would presumably be cameras on mobile 
phones.

Agreed. No dispute that each purpose needs to be well defined and broad 
enough to be useful and narrow enough to meet the needs of the specific 
use cases well. But thats always the case in engineering.

Right.

Well there is only one other user, the recipient. But I tend to think 
this is mostly a function of the 'purpose'. You'd put picture share by 
itself, but more control-style functions (i.e., camera control or 
conference controls) could be multiplexed.

So I agree that this kind of dynamic decision is really complicated and 
a static decision based on purpose is much easier.

I think the level of generality in there is EXACTLY the same as the 
INFO-usages. Thats why the reactions here surprise me. Fair enough that 
I do point out some use cases that are not in the INFO cases draft, but 
it was the whole INFO discussion that got me thinking that we have a 
need for a media-plane equivalent of INFO-events. TOTE is a nearly 
direct translation of the mechanism in Hadriels draft into the media 
plane. Purpose = info package, and the MIME negotiation is already there 
in SIP via Accept.

Thanks for the comments, Miguel. Looks like this topic is a contentious 
one, for different reasons than I thought. Lots of folks didn't want 
info-events, but it looks like lots of folks think we already have 
solutions for the media-plane equivalent (file transfer and the 
media-ctrl framework).

Sure I am aware of that. I saw that as a specific type of data 
communications - file transfer.

I think its the MIME bit that has gotten lots of folks in a tizzy here. 
I think, you are thinking, "MIME object = file" and so this draft is 
basically doing file transfer. But really its about these "purposes", 
and a purpose can be a mini-protocol and not really a file transfer in 
any sense of the word. Would you use the file transfer draft above to 
exchange camera controls? I didnt think so.

The requirements are the same ones driving info-events - the ability to 
communicate between agents for new applications without requiring 
standardization work. I am merely adding a media-path solution to that 
problem.

TOTE is not about file transfer. See above.

Interesting. I had missed that bit of the document.

So I think there are a few ways to see how these relate:

1. as you suggest, TOTE could be an alternative to MSRP and you could 
continue to use the SDP attributes defined in your draft,

2. the file transfer spec very much couples the negotiation of the file 
transfer itself (parameters of the file along with an indication of 
willingness) with O/A. We have been burned by this before, when we've 
tried to take negotiation things and couple them to the O/A exchange. 
Security key negotiation is an example. We found, in the end, by doing 
it in the media path we had more flexibility and were not limited to a 
two-way handshake. So another way to think of it, is this, would you 
benefit from separating the file transfer negotiation from O/A itself? 
Would you benefit from more round trips or more complex objects that are 
hard to place in SDP? I for one always thought file trnasfer is best 
done as a 4-way:

A->B want to send file, here are characteristics
B->A yes, please send
A->B ok here is the file
B->A got it

basically the file transfer is doing the first two in O/A and the last 
two in MSRP, so it kind of works. But I wonder if you had more 
flexibility would we get a feature or capability that would be 
impossible otherwise. For example, the ability of the recipient to 
cancel mid-transaction, or to tell the sender to pause and resume. If we 
went this route, you'd basically take your existing SDP attributes, take 
them out into a standalone protocol message and send e2e over this 
connection instead.

3. file transfer is for file transfer and tote is for other things that 
don't include file transfer; i.e., these look similar but file transfer 
has some special needs and that is why we have a specific spec for it. 
And so both proceed independently.



Architecturally, the interesting question I'm posing, is what is our 
model for extending SIP to accomodate new media-level things. To date, 
it has been about doing SDP extensions for each new thing. This draft 
suggests that we don't do that; that we make SIP/SDP minimal and just 
set up something else that can do the application-specific protocol 
procedures that are optimized for it. This means, you don't need to 
upgrade your SIP/SDP infrastructure (since with b2bua they are coupled) 
every time you want something new. This is the same aspect that has 
attracted people to INFO - I can send new stuff without a new sip 
extension. I'd like the same for the media plane.

Yes I did see this, and had a chance to skim. Looking forward to the 
discussion.

lol. Well TOTE worked really nice in English since it means, "to carry" 
and that is basically what this does.

I revved this ID here

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-rph-new-namespaces-02.txt

I changed the list of namespaces from 50 down to 40, in what looks 
like 4 groups of 10

The namespaces are now

	dsn-000000 through dsn-000009.
	drsn-000000 through drsn-000009.
	rts-000000 through rts-000009.
	crts-000000 through crts-000009.

All have the same 10 priority-values of "0" (lowest priority) through 
"9" (highest priority), and I cut several pages down in the document 
by showing one example, and saying all others are just like it.

I changed a few other nits Keith pointed out.

The list has had one new comment from Dave Worley about making a 
clearer Abstract, and I will (which is ease), perhaps before the WG 
meeting on Thursday.

Additional comments are welcome

James

I revved this ID

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-sip-rph-in-responses-01.txt

What's new in this version:

I clarified that this document deals with "use-case#1" - which is for 
the scenario in which a stateless proxy is surrounded by stateful 
proxies (a stated requirement to use Resource-Priority header, per 
RFC4412), and the stateless proxy needs to be able to rely on the 
Resource-Priority header value in responses.

I explicitly dismissed Janet Gunn's "use-case#2", described here
http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sip/draft-gunn-sip-req-for-rph-in-responses-00.txt 
from consideration in the draft, as it appears that use-case will be 
solved by using Diameter for their authorization of Resource-Priority 
header value in requests and responses.  I believe that is much 
better suited for what they were discussing in Vancouver.

I think I've made the above pretty clear in the doc.

I also rewrote some portions to make them clearer. Plus I fixed some nits.

If folks are agreeable that this document clearly articulates it's 
only covering "use-case#1", and not "use-case#2", I think this doc is 
done - meaning I feel LC can happen right after this becomes a WG doc.

Comments are welcome

James

Hi,
 
I don't think anything has happened since Paul said he agrees :)
 
I guess this is one thing, similar to the PRACK 488 (see other thread), that we need to try to figure out how to document (and, of course, what to document).
 
Regards,
 
Christer

That is correct, the draft is specific to file transfer. Now, I don't 
want to open a discussion about what is a file versus what is a MIME 
object. I think we should focus on the semantics, and what make the file 
transfer draft not feasible for the TOTE protocol.

If it is about a single camera control then it is possible to do it. But 
if the camera control is some sort of continuous interaction, then I 
would probably not use the file transfer, but just vanilla MSRP with the 
appropriate content type.

Yes, the background for the file transfer draft. It tries to emulate the 
  file transfer feature that we have in many instant messaging systems. 
So, the coupling of the file description with the O/A works well in that 
case. Any of both ends can also abort the file transfer. Both ends can 
also pause and resume the file transfer.

I think the OTE draft should reuse the file transfer draft as much as it 
could. Dealing with files or MIME objects is a subtle difference. 
Perhaps the biggest difference is that TOTE tries to create a media 
stream for transferring a MIME object, while the file transfer draft 
assume a given protocol (so far MSRP) and a given purpose (a file). But 
it should be possible for me to offer you a file with either MSRP or the 
simple TCP connection that TOTE uses without much changes to the SDP.

This is certainly the question. But even with the model that TOTE uses, 
you still need to at least register the MIME objects or the underlying 
protocol, right? I understand the SDP should not change for any of these 
usages that you envision, so you don't need to upgrade intermediaries, 
but at least some mnemonic that identifies the protocol should be

Ah, so there are two parts of this discussion:

1. whether MSRP is to be used as a general transport of stuff between 
agents, which is not strictly instant messaging (like camera controls)

2. regardless of MSRP vs. something else, when would one use the file 
transfer mechanism and when not


Frankly I don't think you'd ever use the file transfer mechanism for 
camera controls, even a one-shot. Most of the file selector attributes 
don't make sense here - size, filename, hashes - these are useful 
primarily for transfering an existing stored file, not for carrying 
arbitrary protocols.

So then the question is, is MSRP a general purpose UA to UA transport 
mechanism, or not. Frankly I think it is not. Its designed around 
instant messaging which is a particular application. ITs having 
extensions for things like nicknames and conferencing which are specific 
to IM. The reporting feature is also IMHO very much an IM-specific thing.

File transfer is arguably very close to IM and can benefit from much of 
what MSRP provides; chunking and interruption all make sense because 
these are big objects.

TOTE proposes a much more lightweight transfer mechanism for general UA 
to UA protocols/applications.

How do you do pause with MSRP? Specifically, how does the receiver tell 
the sender to pause? How does the receiver cancel?

That last sentence I agree with. However What I don't agree with, is if 
I am not transferring a file, just doing a camera control or somethign, 
that I have to use the file transfer SDP attributes.

Right, that is correct. Besides, I think the general willingness of 
making implementor's life easy, so that if we end up having several 
orthogonal mechanisms that share some sort of commonality, all these 
mechanism should be able to coexist in an implementation.

I think I concluded the same, but with different reasons. I think camera 
control is probably a stream of actions, so you move the camera up, pan, 
tilt, zoom, etc. Let's assume that you model each action in an XML 
document. I wouldn't use the O/A described in the file transfer draft, 
because you would need to re-INVITE prior to sending each action, get 
acceptance from the remote party (the camera), and then do the action. 
It will be annoying, with a tremendous overhead (re-INVITE), and far 
from real-time.

However, you can easily create a regular MSRP channel where you 
transport those MIME objects. MSRP can carry any MIME object of any 
arbitrary length, so, it meets the needs. The discussion of MSRP/not 
MSRP is below.

I disagree here. You said:
- It is designed around instant messaging: I would say MSRP is designed 
around real-time transfer of objects. The MSRP draft provides examples 
and provisions for transferring, for example, large video files.
- It's having extensions for things like nicknames and conferencing 
which are specific to conferencing: I don't see the point here. It is 
like if you tell me that SIP is not good for voice because there are 
extensions for presence, instant messaging and alike. MSRP is generic 
enough to carry objects between two points. Extensions try to improve 
the user experience for specific applications.

Agreed.

And I don't object it. As I indicated earlier, the use case for the file 
transfer is: I have an instant messaging application that implements 
MSRP. Now you are probably saying: does it mean I need to implement MSRP 
for a trivial file sending. The answer is no, and I don't have any 
problem with the simple trivial protocol that the TOTE draft describes.

Pause from receiver to sender: re-INVITE with SDP offer with the MSRP 
media stream set to inactive.

Cancel from receiver: re-INVITE with SDP offer setting the MSRP media 
stream to port 0.

I said "as much as it could", meaning that re-using or adapting already 
defined SDP parameters.

Hi,

I read the draft and would like to mention that for camera control is =

As for media path connection there is also the RTCP feedback in RFC4585 =

Hi
About the analysis:

"Mediactrl solves the problem of binding a connection to a dialog by
defining a SYNC message. TOTE solves this problem by using ICE, which
provides this correlation as part of its normal operations. Mediactrl
solves the problem of keepalives using its own keepalive message; TOTE
uses the ICE keepalive mechanism."


I think that there is a difference there. Media control is using one
dialog to the media server for opening the control channel. On this
control channel the media server will get many controls that relate to
different dialogs created separately (users connecting to the media
server). The association is between a specific control command and a
dialog and not between the control channel and a dialog.

Roni Even.

2. "Section 5 looks at the reason why mutual inter-domain authentication
   is desired in SIP, and the lack of normative text and behavior in
   RFC3261 for doing so.  Section 7 provides normative behavior on the
   SIP entities (user agent clients, user agent servers, registrars,
   redirect servers, and proxies) that need perform authentication based
   on X.509 certificates."
Odd that there is no mention of section 6. If there really is a need to
describe the document layout, then mention section 6 too.

3. "A domain name in an X.509 certificates"
Change "an" to "a".

4. "6.  Guidelines for a service provider

   When assigning certificates to proxy servers, registrars, and
   redirect servers, a service provider MUST ensure that the SIP AUS
   used to address the server is present as an identity in the
   subjectAltName field of the certificate."
So section 6 is "guidelines" and contains a RFC 2119 language. Whereas
section 7 is normative (according to an earlier statement) and also
contains RFC 2119 language. If they are both normative (in the way
normative is used in BCPs), then they should both be claimed as
normative. "Guidelines" seems too soft.

5. "such usage is NOT RECOMMENDED for new certificates,
   which MUST contain the identity in the subjectAltName extension"
I think we should either use a "MUST NOT" construct in the first half
together with "MUST" in the second half, or use "NOT RECOMMENDED" in the
first half and "SHOULD" in the second half.

6. "implementations must follow checks as
   prescribed therein."
Should this be "MUST"?

7. "The use of the CN value is allowed for backward compatibility,
       but is NOT RECOMMENDED"
This appears in the section on normative behaviour for a SIP entity, yet
it appears to be a recommendation applicable to certification
authorities.

8. "Alternatively,
   the server could have a list of all SIP domain names is allowed to
   accept connections from"
Change "is" to "it is".

9. "the connect-reuse [10] draft discusses this aspect in
   more detail."
I would suggest changing to "connect-reuse [10] discusses this aspect in
more detail", to cover the case where [10] becomes an RFC in time.

10. "A proxy MUST use the procedures defined for a User Agent Server
(UAS)
   in Section 7.4 when authenticating a connection from a client."
and
    "A proxy MUST use the procedures defined for a User Agent Client
(UAC)
   in Section 7.3 when requesting an authenticated connection to a UAS."
But section 7.4 has the title "Server behavior" and not "UAS behavior",
and likewise 7.3 has the title "Client behavior" and not "UAC behavior".
When reading those sections I had assumed the referred to the TLS client
and server. If we were to make it clear that this is the case, we would
not require these statements in 7.5 for a proxy.

11. "A SIP registrar, acting as a server, follows the normative behavior
   of Section 7.4.  When it accepts a TLS connection from the client, it
   present its certificate.  Depending on the registrar policies, it may
   challenge the client with HTTP Digest."
It think this section on registrar behavior is redundant.

12. "A SIP redirect server follows the normative behavior of Section
7.4.
   It may accept a TLS connection from the client, present its
   certificate, and then challenge the client with HTTP Digest."
I think this section on redirect server behavior is redundant too.

13. "the subjectAltName MAY
   contain multiple identifiers for the Subject"
It is not the function of this draft to make normative statements
concerning what can be placed in a certificate.

14. "Since only one certificate is needed for multiple domains, the
keying
   material management is straightforward, but such a certificate MUST
   be revoked if ANY identifier in the certificate is no longer
   associated with the holder of the private key for the certificate."
This section (7) is concerned with behavior of SIP entities, yet this
seems to place a normative requirement on a certification authority.

15. "The TLS extended client hello [7] allows a TLS client to provide to
   the TLS server the name of the server to which a connection is
   desired.  Thus, the server can present the correct certificate to
   establish the TLS connection."
This doesn't seem to fit too well with the preceding paragraphs in
section 7.8, which seem to say that one certificate can have multiple
identities, so why the need for different certificates? I think this
section needs to be made clearer.

16 "Confidentiality:  SIPS messages from alice@example.com to
      bob@example.edu can be read only by alice@example.com,
      bob@example.edu, and SIP proxies issued with domain certificates
      for example.com or example.edu."
Any SIP messages (not just those targeted at SIPS URI) expect this
property if transported over TLS.
Similarly for the next statement on integrity.

17. "8.1.  Connection authentication using Digest"
I have a problem with this section. Digest authentication, in
conjunction with TLS server authentication, is frequently used between
certain classes of UA and their outbound proxy because it is impractical
to provide those UAs with certificates. One of the functions of
sip-outbound is to help make this work. Therefore to say unconditionally
that digest is NOT RECOMMENDED is wrong.

1. "Certificates whose purpose is to
   bind a SIP domain identity without binding other non-SIP identities
   MUST include an id-kp-SIPdomain attribute."
I have several comments on this statement.
a) It seems premature to make this statement prior to the explanation
that occurs in 3.1.
b) Is "MUST" appropriate at this stage, or would it be more appropriate
to include such normative language later in the document, e.g., in
section 5?
c) It looks like it might be in conflict with the later statement:
"Whether or not to include this restriction is
   up to the certificate issuer"

2. "but if it is included, it MUST be
   marked as critical"
Wouldn't this be more appropriate in section 5?

3. "3.  If any EKU is present and contains both
id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage
       and id-kp-sipDomain, accept the certificate."
This may be my lack of expertise in this area, but isn't there another
case where id-kp-sipDomain is present but id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage is
not present? If so, how is this handled. Similarly in the normative text
that precedes this descriptive flow.

Not really.  We *DO* say SIP is not appropriate for carrying the voice itself (vs. RTP), or not appropriate for carrying session-based IM (vs. MSRP).  We say that because of SIP's properties compared to the needs/properties of voice or IM or whatever.  I assume we all agree on that.

MSRP also has properties.  Some of them frankly aren't very good for bulk file transfer, IMHO.  One of those "properties" is it doesn't seem to be getting deployed UA-UA.  It's getting deployed UA-AS-AS-UA, where "AS" is an app server or SBC or both either acting as an MSRP-relay or MSRP-b2bua.  (it shouldn't be a surprise this is happening - the MSRP protocol leaves no other choice)

I don't think it's a good property that a bulk file transfer gets sent through a chain of app servers.  I don't think it's a good property that camera controls get sent through a chain of app servers.  My 2 cents anyway.

GENERAL COMMENTS
I'm concerned about the apparent lack of stability of this draft.
When this draft was originally published, it seemed to me to
have two purposes:

- To capture the BOF consensus on the important security
  properties for an RTPSEC protocol.
- To be a survey for the properties of
  the various protocols compared to those requirements.

The first purpose still seems useful to me, but is best served
by having a draft that reflects that consensus published 
ASAP. The second purpose seems to me to have been sort
of overtaken by events and I'm not sure it's still valuable.

With the first purpose firmly in mind, it seems a little problematic
that this draft has changed so much in the past 6-12 months.
In particular:

- The -02 version totally renamed all the requirements
- I'm not convinced that all the requirements 
  introduced in -00 have WG consensus.

Since there are other documents which need to reference these
requirements, this presents a problem for them.

IMO we should try to quickly converge on the requirements we have
consensus on, remove others, and publish this document as a historical
statement. We should also consider whether the appendices with
the survey of the protocols is really that useful in an archival
document.


DETAILED COMMENTS
S 4.2.
   retargeting problem.  While Connected Identity [RFC4916] allows
   positive identification of the called party, the primary difficulty
   still remains that the calling party does not know if a mismatched
   called party is legitimate (i.e., due to authorized retargeting) or
   illegitimate (i.e., due to unauthorized retargeting by an attacker
   above to modify SIP signaling).

This is totally true, but it's not a media security issue. It's
a SIP issue.

S 4.3.
   though it does consume additional cryptographic context on the mixer
   for each participant and has the advantage of non-repudiation of the
   originator of the incoming stream.

This isn't non-repudiation. It's data origin authentication.
When you have a shared group key, anyone who has the key can impersonate
anyone else. Pairwise keys remove this problem, but they don't
stop me from forging data on our pairwise and claiming it's from you
to a third party. That's non-repudiation.

Also, this section needs discussion of the advantages and 
disadvantages of (d).

R-ID-BINDING:
This requirement doesn't really make sense as stated. 
What needs to be bound isn't an identifier, it's the
media security keys. Imagine a scheme in which new
raw DH shares were generated for each connection and
the public share was Identity signed. That's not 
an identifier, but it's secure.

R-RECORDING:
I don't believe that there is WG consensus on this requirement.

R-TRANSCODER:
I don't think this requirement makes sense as stated.
Any SRTP-using system can always allow transcoding by
having one side share the keys with the transcoder.

No, I don't think we have an answer, though I do have an opinion. :-)

Are you asking about whether the contact may be omitted? Or if it may be 
changed?

AFAIK there is nothing normative that *forbids* the contact from being 
changed in subsequent provisional responses. But doing so is *asking* 
for trouble, so you shouldn't do it. Perhaps you could get away with it 
in a *reliable* provisional, but then you would still have a bunch of 
messy cases. The likelihood of it working is slim. Doing it with 
*unreliable* provisionals is going to cause trouble because they can be 
lost. Even with reliable provisionals, you will have to be prepared to 
receive on both addresses for some period of time.

It seems clear that a contact may be omitted in a 100, since it is hop 
by hop, and presumably must be omitted in the 100 responses from 
proxies. Some other 1xx responses may be returned by proxies (notably 
181) and presumably they should also not contain a contact in those cases.

A 1xx that establishes an early dialog must contain a contact or else 
you really don't have a dialog. I think it is ambiguous whether:
- the first 1xx with a particular to-tag *does* establish an early
   dialog and so *must* contain a contact,

- OR a 1xx with a new to-tag, but without a contact, simply doesn't
   establish a dialog, but is legal.

I would split the difference and say that the UAS MUST include a contact 
in the first 1xx it returns with a particular to-tag, but a UAC should 
accept a 1xx with new to-tag and without a contact and simply treat it 
as not establishing an early dialog. (Don't establish the dialog until 
you get enough info to do so.)

Is there any need for discussion of the DTLS framework
(draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework-01) during our meeting?

The authors think that it is pretty much ready for WGLC and that all
known issues have been resolved.


The list has been fairly quiet on the topic.

Anybody read the new version yet and have an opinion?

Just jumping in, not replying to anyone in particular...

I don't see the relationship between TOTE-like functionality and File 
Transfer at all. But I do see MSRP as an alternative to TOTE for the 
kinds of things Jonathan is proposing TOTE for.

Advantages of using MSRP are:
- its already defined
- it already has all the mime type negotiation defined
- it has some mechanisms to mitigate the head of line blocking issue
- whatever is done to get MSRP through firewalls and proxies
   could be reused for this application
- the exchange of mime objects as envisioned for tote could
   share a connection with IM if IM happens to be in use

Some disadvantages:
- its heavier weight than what Jonathan is proposing
- there may be issues with MSRP relays

The heavier weight of MSRP is an issue for UAs that won't otherwise be 
implementing MSRP anyway. For those that do its probably not an issue. 
OTOH, more uses for the protocol may serve to encourage ubiquitous 
implementation.

The use of relays vs using ICE to get though FWs and NATs has already 
been brought up for MSRP in general I think. Perhaps that needs to be 
considered.

OTOH, the use of media intermediaries of one sort or another for MSRP is 
likely to be required in many cases, at least in enterprises, because 
they have a need to log the stuff for legal or other business reasons. 
It may well be that the same people would conclude that they need to log 
TOTE exchanges too, because it otherwise might be used to tunnel things. 
So it may be that e2e media connections won't be allowed in any case.

Bottom line: I haven't yet decided if I like TOTE or would prefer to see 
MSRP used for that purpose.

(it shouldn't be a surprise this is happening - the MSRP protocol leaves no other choice)

Since I personally only read the abstract of new drafts and extrapolate
all further content (including any errors) by intuitive deduction, I'm
sure that a more detailed abstract would be helpful. ;-)

Seriously, a well-written abstract is a big help for people who haven't
been reading along with the development. Many students I've talked to
start with the abstract, and then use that to decide how the RFC fits
into the mental framework they're building as they try to come to grips
with the documentation-kraken that SIP has become.

We should be careful to make our abstracts as useful for this sort of
thing as we can. That means that the abstract needs to tell us what the
draft is about well enough to fit it into a framework, but not tell us
much about the implementation detail. Admittedly, it is a fine balancing
act -- but I'm afraid the abstract for the draft in question hasn't even
stepped up to the high-wire, much less maintained its balance.

Actually, there are partial-key models where the KG couldn't decrypt it
either.

There are modes of operation that allow the full private key to be a
product of a secret (retained by the user) and the output of the PKG.
Hence you need to know both parts to decrypt or sign a message.

Yep. Early IB systems worked as you describe. But they don't HAVE to
work that way.

A global or semi-global KG makes excellent sense in large domains,
especially where there are significant resource constraints.

Consider, for example, the 3GPP world of GSM phones. A KG hierarchy
rooted at the GSMA with each operator then having a subordinate KG could
make a lot of sense. We could get end-to-end security with significantly
fewer bits being transmitted than if users had to send copies of their
certificates along with every message.

Similar characteristics apply in peer-to-peer cases. The enrollment
process could include a KG interaction. The resulting identity could be
used with IBS for node identification in the overlay as well as message
source verification ("identity" in and RFC 4474 context). This helps
prevent a number of the easy attacks on P2P infrastructure. And of
course, IBE could provide for message privacy as well as integrity
across the untrusted peers that will be serving as proxies.

Not precisely.

1. There are schemes which have multiple KGs which all have to cooperate
   in order to recover the private key (that's what Harsh referred
   to the other day).
2. There are "forward secure" schemes (Gentry) in which the 
   KG forgets your private key and the ability to regenerate it.

However, both of these still have escrow as a sort of inherent property.

It's pretty easy to see that any true IBE scheme has to have escrow:

The fundamental IBE property is that any random person can encrypt
to any identity I knowing only the public system parameters P_pub,
and then for the KG to be able to provide the appropriate K_priv
from P_priv and I.

In order for this to work, you need to be able to compute:

- K_pub =    F1(P_pub, I)
- K_priv =   F2(P_priv, I)

If the user provides some information X that's not known to the KG
*and* X is required to decrypt, then it clearly must affect
K_pub, i.e.,

- K_pub = F1(P_pub, I, X)

But that violates the invariant that K_pub is deterministically
generated from I and P_pub--and it's precisely this invariant that
makes IBE interesting.

This doesn't apply to IBS, of course, since there's no requirement
that the verifier be able to independently compute K_pub. In
fact, one could argue under one definition that a PKI scheme is
an IBS scheme and that X is the user's public key and F1 is
certificate verification. But it's precusely because this invariant
isn't interesting in IBS that IBS doesn't add much value over
PKI.

MSRP needs that because it creates the problem for itself (or rather allows it to happen), because it lets multiple logical use or user connections be aggregated into one TCP connection.  I'm not saying that's good/bad, but for TOTE that wouldn't be an issue needing to be solved, afaict.

If the idea is to provide a media-path-channel alternative for some of the more media-applicable uses of INFO in the wild, the hurdle of MSRP would be immense.  Making vendors choose between either implementing SIP+INFO, or SIP+MSRP?  That's not a hard choice to choose from, and they'll choose poorly.

I have no doubt that would be needed in some cases, maybe even most cases.  There is, however, a HUGE difference between *monitoring* TCP stream data payload contents, and *modifying* TCP stream data payload contents.  MSRP requires modifying, even just for NAT traversal (today).  Some vendors have started to implement proprietary extensions, to avoid that.  That's not a good thing.

What point are you trying to make? A certificate is a data format.
Obviously, it's possible to have a certificate signed by a trust
anchor that isn't commonly trusted. So what?

For the Nth time, this is equally possible with an identity-based
scheme.

Yes, and this is all equally possible with PKI systems. As I
said at the beginning, the only thing that IBS is bringing
to the party here is a smaller credential. As far as I'm
awre, the size of the cert is not the primary reason for lack
of adoption of any of these schemes 

Again, what does IBS bring to the party except compression? [0].

And now we're talking about something totally different: IBE.
I agree that IBE has significantly different characteristics from
PKI. The problems with IBE in SIP are totally different: namely
not knowing the actual identity of the recipietn of the message.
This is the norm in both SIP (retargeting) and P2P (churn)
systems.

[0] It's worth noting that the combination of using ECC and 
doing LZW on certificates would significantly shrink the
size of the cert. I haven't done the math, but I suspect down
to the point where it's not the dominant factor.

I do not agree.

One of the points I raise in my rfc4474-concerns draft is that dtls-srtp 
is basing integrity of the fingerprint on 4474, and that 4474 does not 
provide integrity against intermediary modifications of the number, and 
even for user@domain names this can happen.

I think this needs to be called out in the draft. The security 
considerations section does not discuss this.

Because it's not a DTLS-SRTP issue. It's a SIP/4474 issue.

The fingerprint in the SIP messaging does *not* tie the DTLS-SRTP
handshake to the phone number or to the domain name. Rather, it ties
the media to the SIP signalling. Period. It allows whatever guarantees
you are prepared to assert about the signalling to be extended to
media. If those guarantees allow you to make assertions about the
caller (or callee) identity, then great.  If not, then DTLS-SRTP
doesn't help, nor is it intended to.

Look at it this way:
When the phone rings (or your UA shows you that the other side has
answered), it can show you some meta-information about who you're
talking to. The objections you have to RFC 4474 (and I'm not saying I
agree with them) already apply at this point, before a single RTP
packet has traversed the wire. This is not a DTLS-SRTP issue.

I see that Dale and Aki are discussing this draft.

Do we need agenda time in Philadelphia for further discussion, or are  
we really ready for publication?

Hi,

I agree with Paul's conclusion. But, I still think that is somethin that
we should somehow document and clarify. This is a common reason for
interop problems, so just agree on a mailing list and leave it there is
not a good thing to do.

IF (To-tag && Contact) THEN dialog 

And, it IS allowed to update the Contact in subsequence provisional
responses. But, as Paul said: it is asking for trouble, so it should not
be done unless you have a really good reason for it.

I also think that updating the Contact in a re-INVITE/UPDATE is asking
for trouble. At least you also there need to be prepared to receive
requests on both the new and old contact for a period of time.

Regards,

Christer

I just read through this too and I saw that in the abstract, and
also thought the size of credentials might be  "a problem" but isn't
"THE PROBLEM" with deployment.

Reading (quickly) through draft, I didn't get a sense for what
other problems this solves if any. I'll mention that in addition to
compression you can also use other methods to make key/name
bindings too which don't rely on krufty ASN.1 blobs to make
the point.

So there's no majick here seemingly. Darn.

Without a means of binding the secure media to the identity of the
remote party, DTLS-SRTP is not a complete solution. I don't think we can
say the framework is finished until we have that complete solution. In
particular, the framework uses RFC 4474 as part of the mechanism - if
the solution to the RFC 4474 problem turns out to be something different
from RFC 4474, the framework would be wrong.

Correct. There is no sharing of connections between users, so any HOL 
blocking is caused by a user's own problem. This is why the draft says 
to, based on purpose, use different params. So basically tote lets the 
transport layer solve all these problems.

Yup. Thats why I wanted that "T" in TOTE to be "Trivial".

TOTE would not; you could just insert in the middle of the tcp 
connection and shovel data back and forth without ever looking at the 
payload.

Again the idea is to do this in a way that, we can easily add new 
applications in the future without infrastructure change. So having a 
way to do e2e, SBCs, etc. really easy, and just ONCE, was important.

This is getting off-topic, but I'm a bit concerned about using 
sledgehammers where screwdrivers are warranted.

For canceling a file transfer -- that is, a single MIME object -- you're 
better off using the approach described in section 10.5 of RFC 4975. 
Otherwise, you're running the risk of throwing out an ongoing IM session 
just because you don't want to complete a specific file transfer.

In the pause case, I agree that putting the MSRP stream on hold is a 
valid way to convey the semantics of, "I want you to pause everything 
inside this MSRP session," including the file transfer, but by no means 
limited to it. For most IM-related use cases, it would seem that this is 
very unlikely to be what the user expects, wants, or is even willing to 
put up with.

For example: imagine that we're in an IM session using a client designed 
as you propose above. You start sending me a 5 Mb file. A dialog box 
pops up on my screen that conveys the progress of this file; it contains 
two buttons: [Pause], and [Cancel]. I press the button marked "Pause," 
and the file stops arriving. And suddenly you stop responding to my 
instant messages. Perhaps I manage to guess that the IM session has 
frozen because I paused the file transfer. So, to fix this, I press 
[Cancel]. And the whole IM window just goes away.

(As SIP WG cochair)

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-01.txt

There are a couple of things in this that need revision based on list
discussion, but at the moment it looks like when Gonzalo does this, it
is ready for WGLC.

Now would be a good time to speak if you think that there are open
issues that need to be addressed in this draft, as these are all meant
to be closed before WGLC.

Currently there is no intent to give this agenda time in Philadelphia so
don't depend on that to give you time to rant rather write an email.

Keith

This to my mind is the _actual_ problem hindering deployment. Does
this scheme help that problem or just rearrange the deck chairs? Something
that posits yet another trust anchor would strike me as the latter.

 From the conclusion:

  The advantages with the proposed methods are:

   1.  Key size: Elliptic-curve cryptography arguably provides
       equivalent security with smaller operands than the RSA technique
       typically used with [7 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kupwade-sip-iba-00#ref-7>].  This provides some advantage for
       resource-constrained environments such as mobile telephones.  It
       also reduces the cryptographic load on large-scale devices doing
       frequent authentication checks.

You can do this with PKI or key-centric schemes too.

   2.  Key discovery: Callers can generate the public key of the callee
       from the identity (SIP URI) of the callee and vice versa.  This
       eliminates a requirement for a key discovery mechanism using
       external sources, making deployment significantly easier.

Or you can ship the key or cert in the signaling too.

   3.  Certificate validation: As a result caller or callee need not go
       through the complex path construction process to retrieve the
       public keys of a chain of CAs from the public key depositories
       which are controlled by the respective CAs.  This allows
       deployment in a peer-to-per modality without a need to route SIP
       messages through a centralized identity service or trust peer
       nodes to operate as identity services.

What is the KG if not a centralized entity? I guess I don't
understand this part.

   4.  Revocation: The ease of minting new identities and discovering
       keys allows short-lived identities, reducing the need for
       certificate revocation lists and the checking thereof.  This
       offers very large operational advantages in resource constrained
       environments.

I don't understand why this is "easy". Enrollment is 
"hard" unless there's something really new here. And 
if I wanted a short-lived identity, I could just gin 
up a new public key pair and use that as the identity
too. But I thought that the real problem was dealing with
long term identities like, oh say, mat@cisco.com.

Keith and I just spent the past three hours revising the agenda for  
SIP at IETF 71.

It's very full, and we are not going to have time to discuss  
everything we need to discuss -- we have only 2.5 hours this time.

Please take a look at:

http://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/SIP_Agenda_IETF_71

(no, I'm not trying to send the MHTML by cut-and-paste again given  
what happened last time).

and see if you have any suggestions. Remember, we're supposed to  
concentrate on the chartered working items first (that's the purpose  
of having a charter).

Depending on what we decide about discussing session policies, I can  
see adding that time slice to the INFO discussion. But since we've  
only got 10 minutes for INFO and I can't see resolving that furball in  
25 minutes, it doesn't help much.

Dean

I can't tell what your concern is? Performance?

There are a lot of different designs that trade off the
speed of various operations. In general, at least one
of the operations (encrypt, decrypt) requires a pairing
operation, so IB* systems are in aggregate slower than
comparable non-IB* systems.
   
  Elliptic Curve Pairing operation is faster than the usual RSA operation. 
   
  The bench mark program in the paring based crypto-library developed by the Dan Bonehs research group shows how Elliptic curve parings ( Tate pairings)  are faster than the usual RSA decryption scheme.

Uh, that's not really what's at issue, since (1) RSA isn't really that
fast compared to good EC systems and (2) the RSA decrypt is the
slowest part of RSA. I'm not aware of any IB* system that has superior
aggregate performance to the state of the art EC systems. [0]

Could you please identify the exact IBS system you're talking
about and the performance you believe it has on some system
compared to RSA and ECDH or ECDSA.

-Ekr

[0] I'm assuming you're looking at the upper left hand part
of the table (type-a). This isn't the type of curve people
would usually use for PBC. More like d159 or f, which, you'll
note, are quite a bit slower than type-a. Note, however,
that I've heard that Ben's numbers aren't the fastest going
implementation of PBC, but that doesn't affect the main
point.

10 minutes on the phone number dichotomy thing isn't going to be even 
close enough to cut it. It should be either zero or a more significant 
number.

We have 30 minutes on media security. The only chartered item there is 
the requiremetns document which I thought was mostly done. Why is there 
so much time dedicated to this? I would rather move that to INFO or the 
identity mess.

I agree with Jonathan here. The media-security requirements document
is basically done (see my review earlier today). What it needs it to
be WGLCed and sent to the IESG.

My vote here is for taking this time and giving it to the
TOTE/INFO/mediactrl discussion, which seems like it has a lot of
important and complicated issues that need to be worked through.

And I would think the two X.509-cert related drafts could be combined and take less than 30 minutes.

I agree with Jonathan about the phone number/identity topic - considering the discussion-leader field says "Most of the Working Group", it will take the allotted 10 minutes just to pass the microphone around. ;)

I thought (and hoped) Resource-Priority in Responses
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-sip-rph-in-responses-01.txt
was within the charter (but without a specific milestone) that we can 
make a WG item and WGLC about the same day?

Keith (putting him on the spot) mentioned this in Chicago.  Vancouver 
muddied the water with the introduction of "use-case#2" - which has 
now been explicitly removed from consideration by this version.

What do the WG (and chairs) think about this?

I thought (and hoped) Resource-Priority in Responses
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-sip-rph-in-responses-01.t
xt
was within the charter (but without a specific milestone) that we can 
make a WG item and WGLC about the same day?

Keith (putting him on the spot) mentioned this in Chicago.  Vancouver 
muddied the water with the introduction of "use-case#2" - which has 
now been explicitly removed from consideration by this version.

What do the WG (and chairs) think about this?

I have not managed to send comments yet because I am just reading  
drafts still but, I have a lot of ink on my copies of these. Expect  
some emails. I'm not saying these need agenda time - I'll leave that  
up to the chairs - possible the comments will just be dealt with on  
list but I did want to flag that I suspect these might not be 100%  
done yet.

The problem here is, well, time. At other times we may have had  
constraints of not enough WGs, or not enough cycles from chairs, or  
not enough chairs, but the issues we are having right here is hours in  
the IETF agenda.

Right now we have some conflicts in the scheduling with WG and we only  
have two BOFs. Most of the RAI WG has less time than they want but SIP  
is the most squeezed IMHO. If I had another hour of agenda time in RAI  
right now, SIP is the WG that I would try to give it to and i suspect  
Jon would be on the same page.

The SIP chairs did request more time and did predict that there would  
be a lot of stuff we were trying to squeeze into this. I've asked  
around to chairs of some other RAI WGs and asked if they really think  
they will use up all their time but most are already feeling like it  
is a tight schedule. As we see the agendas for other WG's get  
finalized it might become apparent that we could move some time around  
but I view this as a fairly unlikely possibility.

One observation would be if we could finish (or shoot) some WGs we  
would have more time. Similarly if we could finish a bunch of WG  
items, we would have more time for things. I have lost count of how  
many times the WG has taken a HUM on how the keep-alive timers in  
outbound will work. (I don't mind embarrassing the authors of outbound  
so it is more or less my case study on how not to do a draft but there  
are plenty of similar cases around). Any time people HUM yes to adopt  
a new WG milestone, they need to realize they are putting that work at  
a higher priority level than all the stuff that is not a WG milestone.  
Similarly when we form new WGs it reduces the time available for  
existing WGs. Keep in mind we are running a 2 hours RUCUS BOF which is  
largely related to SIP security so we already do have another 2 hours  
on SIP security.

So what can we do? Two years ago we had an RAI meeting to talk about  
this subject and others. Some of the ideas that came out of that have  
been implemented - splitting the BLISS work out to separate WG and the  
formation of the RAI WG to helps chairs both came out this.  Jon and I  
had talked about having another meeting on this topic at IETF 71 but  
when we saw the agenda we decided it was too full to fit this in. I  
would not be surprised if we tried to run this at the Dublin IETF.   
One thing we can do is encourage stuff to get finished instead of just  
being endlessly discussed. If something has been discussed at a  
meeting, and nothing that would change the discussion has changed  
since the previous discussion, it is surprising to me that we keep  
discussing it anyways.

I spend a ton of time trying to get a workable schedule out on time  
for RAI. (And many thanks to all the RAI Chairs - they do a good job  
of jumping all the hoops to make this happen). I would love feedback  
on what we need to be spending less time on. I get plenty of feedback  
on what needs more.

Not to belabor this topic, but I don't think retargeting is an issue for SIP use of IBE, if by that you mean Alice sent a request to Bob and it got retargeted to Charles and thus Charles could not decrypt it.  It would be considered a feature to some folks.  It would take a second request to fix it, but that's only if retargeting occurs, and then the caller gets to decide if they want to do it to Charles.

The real killer for SIP usage of IBE is that Alice has no idea what KG group Bob is a member of a priori.  For example if Alice is a member of a KG group called "CLINTON", and Bob is a member of KG group "OBAMA".  Alice won't know ahead of time that Bob is a member of OBAMA.  Even if Alice had the OBAMA keying info at hand to use, she wouldn't know Bob is a member of it until she tries reaching Bob.  Since that would happen a lot, there's no serious advantage over conventional pub-key retrieval to encrypt, methinks.

Yes. It would be a trust anchor that would be bound on enrollment in  
the domain, such as when signing up to use a P2p service, or buying a  
mobile phone SIM. One could perhaps bootstrap it from DNS, perhaps  
using a conventional cert as a trust anchor for the process.

Here's a possible sequence: browse to https://p2psip.example.com.  
Complete an enrollment form. Receive a SIP URI and a private key.

Later on, launch your P2PSIP client and connect to the overlay. Sign  
the PUT request for your registration using your private key.  The  
peer you;re talking to can check the signature and validate your  
identity without having to retrieve your public key

True.

There are a lot of other problems with "deployment" that crop up. Many  
are of "perfect is the enemy of good enough". Nobody really wants to  
"run a CA", what with all the dire warnings about the responsibility  
and all the key management issues, and questions about what those  
certs are going to be used for, and so on. But nobody seems to be all  
that averse to running a password database for authentication.

We could easily envision a simple web-service API for PKG services  
that bootstraps off a secured HTML page and a password database, and  
use that to launch a production system that would be considered "very  
deployable" and easy to operate.

We could probably also do the same sort of thing with a CA instead of  
a PKG. It SEEMS easy enough. But nobody does it. Why?

Actually, there's no reason you can't know the identity of the  
recipient of a message. You may not know it in advance of them  
actually receiving the message, but given that they have a key that's  
meaningful to you, they can sign a response to the message. They could  
potentially even sign a response to a message that they couldn't  
actually understand fully -- all they need to know is enough to get  
the response back to you, along with a copy of the message.

We've considered "response identity" a hard problem in SIP. There are  
a couple of reasons:

1) We assume SIP UAs do not have keys that are meaningful to each  
other, due to the difficulty of solving "the CA problem", so end-user  
verification is not available.

2) We assume servers rely on HTTP digest authentication to establish  
an identity relationship. Since digest authentication applies only to  
requests and not responses, identity services only work on requests.  
Of course, draft-ietf-sip-outbound makes it feasible for an identity  
server to be colocated with the "outbound proxy", thereby giving it  
the option of a persistent TLS connection to the UA from which  
identity could reasonably be inserted in responses. But we haven't  
internalized this yet (and "outbound" remains hung up in the process).  
So John Elwell's draft relies on the authentication of messages in the  
opposing direction, giving us "connected identity" instead of  
"response identity". This only works in a subset of cases.

3) We have the unanticipated respondent problem. Somebody on the path  
can retarget requests to somebody with whom you have no prior  
relationship, making any authentication of the recipient a dicey  
proposition. Of course, in an IB-system, everybody has some prior  
relationship (via whatever top-level KG roots the hierarchy), so you  
can validate an identity assertion on any response from within that  
hierarchy. We still don't have a way to know whether such a  response  
is reasonable or not (although IB does allow for some interesting  
possibilities towards solving this too).

So yeah, if you're willing to accept the constrains of an IB model  
(namely, some variation on single-root), then there is majick.

yes, although those keys may be big (a problem for network resource  
constrained environments), AND you have to ship them before they can  
be used for encryption. For signing, I can send my cert along with a  
signed message. But if I'm going to encrypt the message to you, I need  
your public  key BEFORE sending the message.

Since the IB model generates public keys from SIP URIs, if I have  
enough info on you to send you the message, then I also have enough to  
encrypt it.

It's a centralized entity, but OUTSIDE of the signaling path.  
Interaction with it is independent of interaction within the signaling  
plane.

Consider, for example, a P2PSIP deployment that may initially  
bootstrap in a connected environment. Everybody talks to their PKGs  
and gets keyed up. Then a disaster occurs, people jump in their  
response vehicles, and rush off to the impact zone where they form an  
ad-hoc network. Their keys still work without further access to the PKG.

Contrast this to RFC 4474 identity servers, where each SIP request has  
to go through a server, where a cryptographic process occurs. This is  
a very load-sensitive centralized device without which the system  
cannot function.

Sure, we could do something similar by having the "initial bootstrap"  
include a CA process wherein everbody gets a cert. But now we need a  
way of distributing the certs, either by broadcast or some sort of  
query protocol. Why bother when an identity-based-encryption model  
makes it so much easier?

Secondary enrollment, or at least minting a new identity, is  
relatively easy, While the server load for crypto is comparable to  
that of generating a cert, the amount of data on the wire is much  
smaller.

What we have in effect is a two-tier model with "permanent" and  
"temporary" keysets or secrets. Initial enrollment gets you the  
"permanent" keyset. This is then used to generate "secondary" keysets  
on an as-needed basis. One can easily model a single-request API for  
generating the secondaries.

Here, the "permanent" keyset is known only to the user and the PKG.  
The "secondaries" are the identities that are used by everybody else.

So for example, take "sip:mat@cisco.com". You'd probably never be  
contacted using precisely this identity. Instead, we'd use some sort  
of well-known convention to parameterize this identity. For example,  
we might use a time-based convention to delimit the identity to the  
current month: "sip:mat@cisco.com;valid=200802". A monthly validity  
period is roughly equivalent to using certs that expire after 30 days  
-- but the important point is that your correspondents wouldn't need  
to get a new cert for you next month. Instead, knowing the convention,  
they'd just change the identity they use when sending you SIP  
messages. It's even possible to "stock up" on identities in advance --  
for example, generate your 200802 keyset, your 200803 keyset, and so  
on in advance, then just use the right one when you need it.

The important thing is that when somebody knows your base URL, the  
conventions of your domain, and the fixed identity-to-key transform  
algorithm (basically some kind of hash), they can generate your  
current working public key WITHOUT having to talk to some kind of  
centralized server.

While expiry is not a general answer to certificate revocation, it  
does help by making the CRLs very short, and in some cases by  
completely eliminating a requirement for revocation.

Let's talk about conventional certificate revocation. There are ways  
to make it better, but the basic model is that the CA builds a file of  
every certificate it has ever revoked. It keeps this file forever  
(theoretically, it could prune expired certs, but nobody does as they  
keep getting used past their expiry), and keeps adding stuff to it.  
Every time it adds something, it has to re-sign the file using the CA  
cert. This file is called a "certificate revocation list", or CRL.

If a user of certs from that CA wants to see if a cert that has not  
expired is still valid, it does a GET of the CRL. This might be a very  
large file. Assuming, say, 1 million users, 100 bytes per cert (only a  
part of the cert needs to be in the CRL), and a revocation rate of  
just 10%, after a year the CRL is over a megabyte in size. Since stuff  
constantly gets added, every time a user needs to check a cert it has  
to download the whole thing (or it checks periodically, giving us  
windows during which revoked certs will continue to be used).  Then  
the user software does a liner search through the CRL every time it  
wants to use a key.

This sucks, so we have things like OSCP to add validity-verification  
protocols that add round-trip operations before every usage of a cert.  
Gee, that's very helpful if your network is resource constrained or  
partitioned. I happen to be following the IETF's "server migration"  
test list, and I'll note that two weeks after cutover, we're still  
reporting OSCP problems. It is non-trivial to get right. At the  
moment, one of our Most Notable Persons is reporting that the OSCP  
servers used by IETF aren't reachable from his digs in Australia,  
meaning all accesses to IETF's secured web sites fail authentication  
checks and pop up nasty errors after an unconscionable delay. This  
would NOT be helpful to first-responders in a disaster zone, I assure  
you.

Me too. But hey, the media security requirements document is  
CHARTERED. We have permission to work on it and a commitment to a  
deliverable, with a published milestone. We don't have that for INFO  
or the identity mess (even though I think media security is blocked on  
the identity mess -- our AD currently disagrees).

And as we know from experience, 15 minutes is the barest minimum for a  
topic on which there is discussion. I only felt these could get  
anything done in 30 minutes for two because there is some overlap.

Now, if we could get this stuff discussed effectively on list BEFORE  
the meeting, I'd be delighted to dedicate more time to the topics that  
are keeping us all awake at night.

But if both the "CLINTON" and "OBAMA" groups were both subsidiaries of  
the "DEMOCRAT" group, hierarchical inheritance takes care of the  
problem.

You can also do some things using DNS or the like to figure out which  
"group" an identity is in if you can't deduce from the domain.

But where it really shines is in bounded user groups -- say, the set  
of participants in Skype, or people in the Department of Defense, or  
employees of Walmart, when the communication is WITHIN that group.

And if we're talking about something like a single P2PSIP overlay or  
confederation of overlays, then group closure is easy.

The larger the group and the more relatively frequent communications  
are within that group, the greater the efficiency gain from IB crypto.

Paul and Christer,

As I understand the contact/remote-target update is 
remote-target is only set when dialog created , there's no way of
changing it after dialog(early of confirmed) establishment except
target-refresh req(re-inv/update)
the reason is as follows,

in RFC3261 13.2.2.1 1xx Response
   If a provisional response
   has a tag in the To field, and if the dialog ID of the response does
   not match an existing dialog, one is constructed using the procedures
   defined in Section 12.1.2.  

which means the contact would only be set  in UAC upon dialog creation,
even later the non-100 1xx response(wether reliable or not) 
change contact, the dialog state would not change as above.
similar meaning is stated in
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg07893.html

and here only says to tag is the sole criteria for early-dialog
construction, not contact header mentioned at all.
similar discussion at
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sipping/current/msg14510.html


if dialog-creating-non-100-1xx does not have contact, looks like the
it's RFC2543-compliant UA and remote-target of the UAC should be To as
per RFC2543 section 11.3
check Brette's option here
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sipping/current/msg14514.html

When dialog transitioned from early to confirmed.

sec 13.2.2.4 2xx Responses
   If the dialog identifier in the 2xx response matches the dialog
   identifier of an existing dialog, the dialog MUST be transitioned to
   the "confirmed" state, and the route set for the dialog MUST be
   recomputed based on the 2xx response using the procedures of Section
   12.2.1.2.  Otherwise, a new dialog in the "confirmed" state MUST be
   constructed using the procedures of Section 12.1.2.

      Note that the *only* piece of state that is recomputed is the
route
      set.  Other pieces of state such as the highest sequence numbers
      (remote and local) sent within the dialog are not recomputed.  The
      route set only is recomputed for backwards compatibility.  RFC
      2543 did not mandate mirroring of the Record-Route header field in
      a 1xx, only 2xx.  However, we cannot update the entire state of
      the dialog, since mid-dialog requests may have been sent within
      the early dialog, modifying the sequence numbers, for example.

So only route set could be changed, remote-target just remains as the
same as early dialog, even 200 change the contact.

comments?

or not?


Hi,

I agree with Paul's conclusion. But, I still think that is somethin that
we should somehow document and clarify. This is a common reason for
interop problems, so just agree on a mailing list and leave it there is
not a good thing to do.

IF (To-tag && Contact) THEN dialog 

And, it IS allowed to update the Contact in subsequence provisional
responses. But, as Paul said: it is asking for trouble, so it should not
be done unless you have a really good reason for it.

I also think that updating the Contact in a re-INVITE/UPDATE is asking
for trouble. At least you also there need to be prepared to receive
requests on both the new and old contact for a period of time.

Regards,

Christer

Dean - I think we must be having some serious miscommunications - many  
times in the past I have had enough typos in my emails that no one  
could understand what I might have been thinking but ....

I don't think I said that. The two things I thought I said that might  
have been confused are:

1) I don't think the E.164 discussion is holding up milestone items in  
MEDIACTRL or SIMPLE

2) I don't think a problem in some mechanism such as 4474 should be  
holding up the media security requirements draft. (If I could bold  
requirements in the previous sentences I would)

I certainly do think it is important that we have a clear  
understanding of how E.164 numbers fit into the overall SIP security  
picture.  Sorry if I said something that made you think otherwise.

Ok, maybe I'm reading something wrong here.

 From the list conversation, it seems like some people think there's a  
relationship between DTLS-SRTP and SIP Identity, aka RFC 4474.

Other people think that there's a problem applying RFC 4474 when we  
use phone numbers.

Some people think we use phone numbers a LOT, maybe almost all the  
time, and that therefore we really need to figure out how this impacts  
RFC 4474 and our other concepts of identity.

This makes it seem to me like maybe we need to get the identity stuff  
nailed down before we commit to a final version of DTLS-SRTP. Or maybe  
the other way around -- we nail down DTLS -SRTP, then figure out what  
we need from Identity to support it, then fix Identity. Or maybe we  
need to fix them both together.

Now our AD is telling me that by reading it this way, I'm  
unprofessionally evidencing bias in favor of some other protocol that  
may have been discussed prior to DTLS-SRTP (and the name of which I  
honestly can't remember right now). I find this unlikely, given that I  
don't actually understand any of the protocols and only parrot what I  
read on the mailing list earlier today.

So let's put it to the working group. Is there a relationship between  
DTLS-SRTP, phone numbers, and identity that needs to be figured out?  
If so, how much of a problem is this? Do we care?

Yes, this is a clear advantage of IBE over PKI-based systems. But
as I said, it doesn't apply to IBS. Moreover, if there's any
kind of retargeting, then IBE has real problems.

But this is *by design* because the original system for public key
end-to-end authentication, S/MIME which *did* use end-user
certificates, was determined to be impractical, because--wait for
it--end-entity enrollment was such a PITA. A situation which is
*exactly* the same for IB* systems.

Again, you're conflating encryption with data origin authentication.
Yes, this is an advantage of IBE, for encryption. It doesn't make it
any easier for signature however, as noted above.

Uh, sure. You authenticate to the CA/KG and it sends you your new
credential. In the case of the PKI, you get a new certificate, which
is definitely less than 1KB, but since it's almost exactly the same as
the old cert, what you really need is the new signature, so we can
compress that down to 320-1024 bits, depending on the signature
algorithm.

In the case of BB signatures, to take one instantiation, the private
key is 320 bits, so we're basically looking at a wash. Except,
of course, that you need to transmit the private key securely
whereas the certificate can be distributed over an insecure
protocol, so once you factor in the overhead of the SSL connection
(or S/MIME, or whatever) you use to distribute the private key,
things start to look a lot worse.

Strangely, enough it happens, that I'm aware of all this, but the
situation is *no different* for Identity-based signature. The
way that IBS handles revocation is to make each identity short-lived
and force the user to periodically fetch a new private key.
This is *totally equivalent* to forcing the user to get a new
certificate instead. Yes, people do generally use CRLs, because
short-lived certs are actually a PITA, but PKI models can definitely
be operated the same way that an IBS system can.


Once again, all the advantages you're talking about are advantages of
IBE, not IBS. And yes, IBE indeed does have different operational
characteristics than PKI and these certainly may be an advantage in
some environments.  But that's not what this draft is abut. This draft
is about IBS. And as noted in my original review, the benefits of IBS
over conventional PKI in this setting are marginal at best.

So, if you want to propose a draft that uses IBE for SIP encryption
(and note that since there's are IBE for S/MIME drafts, this is simply
a matter of reprofiling the algorithm set) you'll get a totally
different reaction from me. But to keep talking about advantages
of IBE as if they apply to this draft completely confuses the
issue.

I don't think he's claiming it's a "DTLS-SRTP" protocol issue, it's an issue for draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework-01.  Reading this draft it sure seems to me the draft makes claims rfc4474 can't live up to.  It's not a knock on the idea, just that some statements the draft makes need some clarification/softening or elaboration.  Not everyone reading it in the future lives and breathes this stuff as you do. :)

For example, the end of section 2 says:
   Alice and Bob will verify the fingerprints from the certificates
   received over the DTLS handshakes match with the fingerprints
   received in the SDP of the SIP signaling.  This provides the security
   property that Alice knows that the media traffic is going to Bob and
   vice-versa without necessarily requiring global PKI certificates for
   Alice and Bob.

That is not actually true.  In fact, it's not even true with perfect end-end rfc4474 - it requires rfc4916, afaik. (4474 only helps Bob, not Alice, right?)  But even then it doesn't mean "Alice" and "Bob" know it to be absolute.


Also section 8 says:
   As long as each side of the connection can verify
   the integrity of the SDP INVITE then the DTLS handshake cannot be
   hijacked via a man-in-the-middle attack.  This integrity protection
   is easily provided by the caller to the callee (see Alice to Bob in
   Section 7) via the SIP Identity [RFC4474] mechanism.

Well, rfc4474 doesn't actually provide integrity by the caller to callee, so clearly it can't be "easily" done using it.  I should also note that section 7, which is referenced there as the way to do this, actually says:
   The SIP signaling from Alice to her proxy is transported over TLS to
   ensure an integrity protected channel between Alice and her identity
   service.

That is also a nit error, in that the term "ensure" isn't right.  Using TLS from the UAC to proxy ensures you're using TLS from the UA to the proxy.  The proxy may or may not be the identity service, or may or may not be using TLS to your registrar, and your registrar may or may not be the identity service, and so on.


Also, section 8 does describe the weaknesses of other mechanisms to bind the media to signaling, such as section 8.2 on SIPS.  But it does not do so with regard to rfc4474.  That implies to the average RFC reader there are none.

Yes, DTLS-SRTP without rfc4474 is an emperor with no clothes.

10-4, we need the 411 on numbers.

Well, Identity's a much bigger deal.  Identity may not be fixable for numbers.  I vote we finish up the DTLS-SRTP-framework draft for submission, and move on to Identity.  DTLS-SRTP works in the context it is claimed to, and should not be held up just because we want to extend the context.  If we figure out something needs to change later, we fix with a -bis or update.

Dean,

The DTLS-SRTP framework is clear that you depend on RFC 4474 to bind the
secure media stream to an identity. There are two issues with RFC 4474
that have received considerable discussion and have led to a long list
of I-Ds:
- The E.164 problem - not a problem if we use DTLS-SRTP only with
email-style SIP URIs, but some people would argue that this is not
feasible.
- The SBC problem.
Both of these are real world problems that aren't going to disappear
overnight as soon as networks deploy DTLS-SRTP. Rather, DTLS-SRTP will
not be deployed because it won't work on existing infrastructure. I do
want to see DTLS-SRTP completed, but not in a way that is of no use to
much of the market.

John

Point taken, I agree with it. I think we will add this and other 
clarifications to the file transfer draft.

Notice that the file transfer draft requires a single MSRP session for 
file transfer, so pausing the MSRP session will only have effect on the 
file transfer. In any case, I agree on the benefits of using the 413 
response.

As I said, this wouldn't happen with any of the proposals, because the 
MSRP session of the file transfer is different from that of the instant 
messaging.

(As SIP WG cochair)

As Dean already said, we spend 3 hours last night trying to plan a 2 1/2
hour session based on input we do not completely have. We don't think we
finished, but this was the best we could reach so far in the time
available. Things can move up, but they don't solve the fundamental
problem that we don't have enough time. It was not our idea to limit SIP
to a single session - this was forced on us by the ADs.

Modification of this agenda is more likely to occur not by complaining
about the time allocated, but by the presence of technical discussion on
list over the next 8 days.

Some generals:

We have taken the principle that if discussion time is needed on
chartered items specifically, then they come first, and more
specifically highest priority for any discussion needed to get something
out of WGLC and into publication request. This is then followed by
documents that we envisaged could hold up chartered items (in this and
other groups) if not discussed. Then follow the other items where time
has been requested.

Some specifics based on comments received so far:

Domain-certs and eku are in WGLC which ends of Friday next week. These
are a dependency from other chartered items where we are ready to submit
the publication request. We will not have a view of what specifically
needs discussion on these in the meeting until the end of the WGLC, when
all the comments are in. Many of the comments made will not need
discussion in the SIP session and can be discussed on list by the
editors after the end of last call. If any comment does need SIP WG
session time, then we will give it on the above basis.

Outbound is in WGLC and has no time. We are still waiting for input to
know if it needs time - not helped by the authors dropping yet another
new version in the inbox 3 minutes before the -xx deadline when it
should have been there a month ago. Our current view is to issue a
refreshed WGLC on this following the meeting but that can change.

Location conveyance is in WGLC and has no time. Again author drops new
version in inbox 3 minutes before -xx document deadline. This document
is impacted by:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-peterson-geopriv-retransmissio
n-00.txt

Which will be discussed in the GEOPRIV group, but if followed reverses
the decision we made in the location-conveyance breakout at the last
meeting. We hope the GEOPRIV discussion does not force rediscussion in
SIP, but please bear in mind that it could do so.

RPH in responses is not chartered. 2 meetings back the WG expressed a
wish to work on this. The AD pushed back to our request to charter. As
the AD makes the decision, it is not chartered and has no milestones.
That's why we had the further discussion in the last meeting - where
again we came to no conclusions, and I assume the AD is still
unconvinced. Fundamental problem - convince the AD. Put him in a corner
somewhere in Philadelphia and kick hell out of him, but we don't need
the SIP session to watch you do that - although it may be entertaining!

Media security requirements is holding up other chartered items in both
SIP and AVT. When we considered this for inclusion, we believed there
were two items that may need agenda item. Overnight Dean seems to have
taken the time away at the moment, but I remain unconvinced that this
does not need time.

This is the media-security requirements milestones:

Sep 2007    Requirements for media keying to WGLC (Informational)  
Nov 2007    Requirements for media keying to IESG (Informational)  

Which provides the requirements for the mechanism in these charter items
in SIP.

Dec 2007    Establishment of secure media sessions using DTLS-SRTP to
WGLC (PS)  
Feb 2008    Establishment of secure media sessions using DTLS-SRTP to
IESG (PS)  

And these chartered items in AVT:

Dec 2007    Submit in band keying mechanism for SRTP draft for Proposed
Standard

For what it's worth, being neither chair nor AD, I absolutely want
media-security-requirements to finish and if there are significant
comments on the document, I 100% endorse giving it agenda time.

That said, based on my review and the lack of traffic on the list, my
opinion is that there aren't any major issues[0], so we should declare
victory and move on!


Thanks,
-Ekr

[0] The only real issues I raised in my comment were:
    - Should we remove the survey from the appendix. I'm fine
      leaving it in, since I was mostly worried about it 
      needing constant update.
    - Requirement R-RECORD. I think we could just take a 
      straw poll on this one.

As far as I'm concerned, this is ready for publication. 

I think the issue that remains does not warrant WG time. I think in
principal me and Dale agree, but we just need to figure out what (if
anything) the draft should say on the issue. In any case, this text
would probably end up being non-normative, which means it's not critical
to flesh out in detail for a publication request.

Cheers,
Aki

Well one of the issues I thought needed agenda time was yours from
yesterday. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL COMMENTS
I'm concerned about the apparent lack of stability of this draft.
When this draft was originally published, it seemed to me to have two
purposes:

- To capture the BOF consensus on the important security
  properties for an RTPSEC protocol.
- To be a survey for the properties of
  the various protocols compared to those requirements.

The first purpose still seems useful to me, but is best served by having
a draft that reflects that consensus published ASAP. The second purpose
seems to me to have been sort of overtaken by events and I'm not sure
it's still valuable.

With the first purpose firmly in mind, it seems a little problematic
that this draft has changed so much in the past 6-12 months.
In particular:

- The -02 version totally renamed all the requirements
- I'm not convinced that all the requirements
  introduced in -00 have WG consensus.

Since there are other documents which need to reference these
requirements, this presents a problem for them.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This seemed to be a concern about scope creep, and as it is the chairs
that have probably allowed that creep, it is probably difficult for them
to direct it back to where it ought to be. This is coupled with a
concern about whether all the requirements have consensus. This seemed
to be something that we would normally deal with in the WG session to
see if this comment was representative on the rest of the group and
trying to judge how to fix the problem.

Note that we have absolutely no issue with resolving comments like this
on list - if we are able to.

Other input is welcome to resolve this, and please identify any specific
requirements that you believe do not have consensus.

Regards

Keith

Keith,

Here are a few comments on the SIP-EKU I-D:

	- the document does not seem to state explicitly that the cert
SHOULD/MUST contain a SAN with a DNS name. The references to the domain
name in section 2 never say where the name should appear. Even if this
is discussed separately in the SIP domain cert I-D (I'm on a flight now
and don't have access to the net to grab that I-D, so I don't now for
sure), it should be reiterated here, so that a reader can be reminded of
whatever constraints apply to where the domain name appears.

	- section 3 contains references to other EKUs, ones defined more
broadly for TLS use, but it refers to them only by name. Some references
and a brief note on he usual semantics associated with these EKUs would
make this section more self-contained.

	- section 4 says "If the certificate contains the
id-kp-sipDomain EKU extension, then the certificate MUST be accepted as
valid for use as a SIP certificate."  This probably should be reworded
as cert path validation is a complex process and the presence of this
EKU value does not cause the cert to be "valid" in a larger context.

	 - the secruity considerations section is pretty thin. For
example, I'd expect some discussion the implications of the various
"local policy" bullets in section 4, and why they are there (e.g., for
backward compatibility).

Steve

Folks -

Lets try to get the Essential Corrections and -invfix- discussion off  
the agenda since there are clearly gnarlier things to talk about.

I sent in a revision to inv-fix attempting to address Jonathan's  
concern about stand-alone readability.
Jonathan - is the new format better? Can we go with this?

I sent a separate message showing what it would look like to build a  
diff against 3261 that we could put in the document. You'll
remember that on looking at it, its my opinion that going down that  
path is a very bad idea.

So far, there's only been one response on list to those messages.

Please, everyone (especially those that have expressed strong  
opinions in the past), look those over and let us know if we're
past the primary concerns, or if we still have something to work  
through that needs face time to do so.

Subject: domain certs for SIP I-D

Folks,

Having just read and reviewed the EKU use in SIP certs I-D, I thought it
appropriate to review this I-D, since most of the details for SIP certs
and their use line in this document.

Overall I think the document does a very good job of making several
clear statement about a cert profile for use with TLS in the SIP
context, as well as usage conventions, and I think the statements are
good ones as well! It does have some ambiguous text in the early parts
of the document, which I have noted via comments.  I also suggested a
number of edits, which makes for a modest amount of "red ink."

I think you should consider moving the EKU discussion into this I-D,
since EKU details are minor relative to the rest of the cert profile and
use discussion.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Steve

John - sorry for the slow reply - I wrote a reply the day you sent  
this, but as far as I can tell it got eaten before it made it to the  
list.

I didn't intend section 7 to be "just" a description - you inferred  
that from "this section describes"?.

Yes, the document has the risk you describe. I don't think we can  
avoid that without giving up making a standalone section that's
as clear as Jonathan wants or specifying exactly what changes in  
3261. The only way to mitigate that risk is careful review, which
I think is possible given that the scope of this fix (and all *fix  
documents) should be pretty small.

I feel pretty strongly that _for this change_, specifying exactly  
what gets touched in 3261 is important or we'll end up with  
interoperability
arguments. The language that got touched is argued through at each  
SIPit already - not making it as crystal clear as possible how it gets
impacted will make that worse. Whether or not we need to do that for  
every *fix document,  I don't feel quite as strongly about, but this one
is an existence proof that we'll need it for some.

I agree that sip-media-security-requirements needs to finished quickly, 
however, I hope that it does not require agenda time at IETF 71.

With regards to Eric's comments about scope and on particular requirements:

Personally, I don't see the appendices as an important part of this 
document, but if other working group members believe the appendices are 
valuable for historical archive, then I would not object to their 
inclusion (provided that the inclusion of the appendices does not hold 
up the rest of the document).

R-ID-BINDING:
Perhaps we could reword this as:
"The media security key management protocol must enable the media 
security keys to be cryptographically bound to an identity of the endpoint."

R-RECORDING and R-TRANSCODER:
These requirements only call for a description (somewhere) of mechanisms 
to support (respectively) recording and transcoding. Personally, I think 
these are requirements. In particular, they could be satisfied by 
specifying that in environments where recording (or transcoding) is 
required, the endpoint must share its key with the recording (or 
transcoding) device. At some point in the future we can discuss whether 
there is a better approach for satisfying one (or both) of these 
requirements (and at such a point we can discuss whether there should be 
a recommended format for transferring a key to a recording device) but 
for the time being I think the requirements are reasonable and we can 
move on.

	John - sorry for the slow reply - I wrote a reply the day you
sent this, but as far as I can tell it got eaten before it made it to
the list.=20

	I didn't intend section 7 to be "just" a description - you
inferred that from "this section describes"?.

	Yes, the document has the risk you describe. I don't think we
can avoid that without giving up making a standalone section that's
	as clear as Jonathan wants or specifying exactly what changes in
3261. The only way to mitigate that risk is careful review, which
	I think is possible given that the scope of this fix (and all
*fix documents) should be pretty small.

	I feel pretty strongly that _for this change_, specifying
exactly what gets touched in 3261 is important or we'll end up with
interoperability
	arguments. The language that got touched is argued through at
each SIPit already - not making it as crystal clear as possible how it
gets
	impacted will make that worse. Whether or not we need to do that
for every *fix document,  I don't feel quite as strongly about, but this
one
	is an existence proof that we'll need it for some.

		So we have two sections containing RFC 2119 language and
saying the same thing in different ways. If section 7 is just a
description, as it claims, then should it not avoid RFC 2119 language.
Otherwise, which section takes precedence in the event of a conflict?

			Based on the feedback from the -00 draft, I've

patching-the-text form that already exists).

			Please look at the new section 7 and see if this
addresses the concerns around the document format.

			I also spent some time experimenting with the
suggestions to provide the changes in a diff format and have

discussion, I did prepare a patch file that I'll send in a separate

the wrong approach to take though. We really don't want

the "current spec". If we really want a new document, lets create
			a bis and be done with it.

			The point of creating the patch-the-text form in
the first place was not to facilitate creating a new
			document out of the old document. It was done so
that the impact of the changes on the spec is
			expressed in as unambiguous a form as possible.
The worst outcome would be an update that

				Subject: New Version Notification for
draft-sparks-sip-invfix-01=20


				A new version of I-D,
draft-sparks-sip-invfix-01.txt has been successfuly submitted by Robert
Sparks and posted to the IETF repository.

				Filename: draft-sparks-sip-invfix
				Revision: 01
				Title: Correct transaction handling for
200 responses to Session Initiation Protocol INVITE requests
				Creation_date: 2008-02-07
				WG ID: Independent Submission
				Number_of_pages: 18

				Abstract:
				This document normatively updates RFC
3261, the Session Initiation
				Protocol (SIP), to address an error in
the specified handling of
				success (200 class) responses to INVITE
requests.  Elements following
				RFC 3261 exactly will misidentify
retransmissions of the request as a
				new, unassociated, request.  The
correction involves modifying the
				INVITE transaction state machines.  The
correction also changes the
				way responses that cannot be matched to
an existing transaction are
				handled to address a security risk.



				The IETF Secretariat.

I thought this was an interesting read and might raise our awareness  
of just what sort of situation we're facing when we design security  
mechanisms.

I see it as applying directly to IBS. Every message carries enough  
information (without the overhead of carrying a cert) for any  
recipient in the hierarchy to be able to validate a signature on that  
message. That's very useful in a P2P sort of world.

For example, if you're a peer making an admitting decision, you can  
validate a signature on an admission request without having to "get"  
the cert for that user from the DHT.

But by examination, it's easy to solve for IB systems. You say the  
same solution can apply to cert-based systems.

Why doesn't anyone do it that way? There must be more to it -- maybe  
just a cognitive gap, but there MUST be some underlying reason or  
reasons.

Skype, for example, has the "feel" of an IB system as I describe it,  
even though it's really more conventional crypto underneath. But they  
don't pretend to be a CA.

As noted above, it DOES. Anybody who has an identity within the  
hierarchy can validate signatures on messages without needing to fetch  
a cert.

Given that we have a two-layer model with permanent and temporary  
secrets, the permanent secret could be used to encrypt the temporary  
private key, making it work just like a protected cert.

But wait, there's more. There is math available that makes the thing  
that comes back from the PKG a "partial" key that then has to be  
combined with the secret held by the user to be useful. As such, the  
partial key isn't secret -- it can be transmitted in plain text.

The key issue to getting this (and a couple of others where we have
agreed "essential") into WGLC and progressing is to work out the final
format for presenting, as Robert indicates below. 

We have people saying they don't like what we have had previously, but I
don't see them addressing the issue now. In future maybe we ignore
people who rant at the mic and then don't address the issue on the list.

We're going around in circles. The only overhead here of carrying
the cert is the certificate data itself. In other words, this is a
fancy form of certificate compression, just as I said at the 
beginning.

I've deleted the rest of your message since it primarily goes over
the same ground.

It still has 30 minutes on the draft agenda, if I'm reading it  
correctly.

It's the framework draft (draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework-01) that  
currently doesn't have agenda time. The framework depends on the  
requirements, right?

Well, sort of.

To the extent to which we're discussing new requirements that
might require modifying the technical content of the framework,
yes. I'm not aware of any such requirements.

To the extent to which we're discussing editorial changes
that affect the "requirements analysis" at the end of the
framework document (e.g., changing the name of requirements
but not their content) then there's an editorial dependency,
but I'm fine with having that analysis be against a given
version of the requirements document.

To the extent to which we're just wordsmithing the requirements
document (for instance, discussing whether to remove the appendix),
then no.

I agree with John that there are two identity-related issues related to 
DTLS-SRTP framework.

For each of the two problems (the E.164 problem and the SBC problem), 
the working group needs to decide whether it's better to complete 
DTLS-SRTP framework quickly and add appropriate text regarding the lack 
of applicability in certain deployment scenarios; or whether it's better 
to delay DTLS-SRTP framework while we work on solving the problem.

Personally, I think that the E.164 problem is going to be hard to solve, 
and that it should not hold up DTLS-SRTP framework. (That is, that we 
should release a DTLS-SRTP framework that only works with "email-style" 
SIP URIs.) That being said, E.164 numbers aren't going away any time 
soon and so I think RAI should definitely perform work on how to obtain 
useful (as least PSTN-grade) identity guarantees for SIP requests with 
an E.164 number in the From: field.

On the other hand, perhaps the SBC problem is one that we should resolve 
before advancing DTLS-SRTP framework. In particular, there are at least 
two proposals on the table (I.D-wing-identity-media and 
I.D-fischer-sip-e2e-sec-media) that say "use something other than 
RFC4474 for DTLS-SRTP framework". However, the concern that I have in 
solving this problem is that, in the absence of guidelines for how a 
'well-behaving' SBC will handle particular headers or SDP bodies, it's 
hard to design a protocol that will interoperate well with SBCs.

Note: Obviously, this concern is not DTLS-SRTP-Framework specific and 
given that SBC-issues keep coming up in a variety of working groups, 
perhaps RAI needs to reach consensus that either:
A) We will not address SBC-related concerns when engineering protocols 
(e.g. we advance DTLS-SRTP without solving the SBC problem).
B) We will seek to design protocols that interoperate with "most" 
existing SBCs at the time the protocol specification is written.
C) We will seek to design protocols that interoperate with 
"well-behaving" SBCs (i.e. SBCs that adhere to the following set of 
guidelines).
D) ?????

(A) is ignoring the reality that SBCs aren't going away. (B) is 
difficult in practice because SBC behavior is not always well-documented 
and seems to change over time. (C) requires significant work writing 
appropriate guidelines that takes cycles away from (more important) RAI 
work. Perhaps someone can suggest a good (D)?

I'm pushing back on finding a time to do this. Of course, I would want  
it to be productive use of time but I think Dean and Keith can figure  
out a way to accomplish that.

Cullen with my AD hat on.

Hi Folks,

As many of you probably saw, I submitted a new version of the outbound
specification just before the draft deadline on Monday. There was a lot of
general rewording to try to improve clarity and readability, but we received
a number of contradictory suggestions, so hopefully it flow well.  The major
changes are:

- removed references to the 'keep' and 'timed-keepalives' parameters
- added the 'Flow-Timer' header
- changed the wording for the recommended timing over TCP. if battery
consumption is an issue, the recommended keepalives are approximately every
14 minutes.  If battery consumption is not an issue, the recommended
keepalives are approximately every two minutes.
- added text explaining that an edge proxy which sees an 'ob' parameter in
its Route header (probably copied form the Path vector by the authoritative
proxy) in a dialog-forming request, the edge proxy needs to insure that the
route set will allow in-dialog requests to arrive over some valid flow to
the UA instance. In the simplest cae, the edge proxy could just copy the URI
(with flow token) from the Route header into the Record-Route header and
delete the 'ob' parameter. If the Contact is a GRUU that should be
sufficient too.  If the edge proxy wants to do something fancy that even
without GRUU allows mid-dialog recovery of a specific flow, that's allowed
as well.
- added the 439 (First Hop Lacks Outbound Support) response code
- wrote a very complete example (which is hopefully correct)

I hope this is satisfactory to the group. The way timers work is much
simpler and more powerful and will hopefully please both server and client
folks (wired and wireless alike).

In addition, there was a comment on the list about using outbound with
transaction stateless proxies.  As it turns out, it is impossible to
implement an RFC3261-compliant proxy that always operates statelessly.
Implementation of TCP (and TLS over TCP) is required in RFC 3261 and when
sending or receiving over TCP a proxy MUST become stateful. Based on this, I
do not feel badly stating that proxies which implement outbound MUST be
transaction stateful.

thanks,
-rohan

We can do PSTN-grade identity assertions of E.164's today already:
just trust your pre-configured SIP trunk to not lie.  You set up SIP
trunks to organizations with a contractual or gentleman's agreement 
to not lie.  You don't even need RFC4474 to do that.

That is exactly as good as the PSTN's identity.

This is all feeling very much like the history of the IETF's
involvement with NATs and the IETF's involvement with firewalls.

I'm not sure we want to fail a call if validation fails; 
rather, we may want to allow it to complete and tell the
user 'unauthenticated caller' (similar to what the PSTN 
does today by displaying "unidentified call" when caller
ID failed).

When I went through the list of comments relating to draft-ietf-sip-outbound-11
in preparation for draft-ietf-sip-outbound-12, there was one item I agreed
with Rohan and Cullen that I would bring to the list. 

There were some questions raised about the usefulness of the Flow-Timer
parameter. Interestingly enough, it appears that this originally came from... myself.

While I remember why I originally tought it would be useful, I no longuer believe 
that it is useful.

My suggestion would therefore to remove the Flow-Timer parameter altogether.
(I will note that previous versions of the draft didn't have it).

Comments?

When you first suggested it, I was not in favor of it. But you  
convinced me over time that it was great. Now I love it.

Seriously, I don't feel strongly one way or the other. If no one wants  
it and is going to use it, I think we should remove it in the name of  
simplifying the draft.

I agree that the point we're discussing is largely a matter of
providing a "beware" statement, except with the exception of a
possible *solution* to the problem which I will mention at the bottom.
But in any case, I don't see the need for agenda time at the metting
to discuss this.

   From: Aki Niemi <aki.niemi@nokia.com>

   > The notifier cannot know what routing is in front of it, because it
   > cannot know what URIs might route to it.

   Then that's bad. How does the notifier then know which PIDF to pick in
   presence subscriptions?

Especially if it's not a presence subscription.  But seriously, is
this proposal confined to presence events?  I see no such text.

In general, a SUBSCRIBE will fork, and the subscriber presumably knows
how it wants to integrate the events it will receive from the various
subscriptions, based on the semantics of its situation.

   I agree this kind of setup presents a problem. But I also think that
   what we're dealing with here is not that different from the web world.
   There are a lot of load balancing schemes that can be used with HTTP,
   which result in a GET ending up in different data centers in different
   parts of the world at different times.

   What's important to note there is that if the service that is accessed
   via this GET needs sessions and gives out cookies, then the backend
   system needs to be synchronized. Otherwise, the servers will be unaware
   of each others cookies, and the service won't work correctly.

   Similarly, the backend to the SIP notifiers needs a synchronized
   backend, otherwise, subnot-etags won't work.  Naturally, the etags just
   like cookies can be constructed in such a way that they contain the
   necessary state.

There's a hidden philosophical problem:  People think of SIP routing
as being like PSTN routing, where the caller sends the call to a
number which designates one destination, or at least, a single device
which has total knowledge of a small number of possible destinations.
The caller knows the globally-recongized *name* of the
destination-group, and every destination knows of and is coordinated
with *every other possible destination*.

Your HTTP model is similar; you assume the request will reach one of a
set of servers that are co-adminstered.

But the reality is that SIP routing can be like sending e-mail to a
mailing list -- the sender doesn't know what the possible destinations
are, and each destination doesn't know what all the destinations are
either, because some of the routing can be done by agents that are not
co-administered with either the sender or the destination.

Now I think the first case is more common, but if we are going to
design a general mechanism, it should not fail badly in practice in
the second case.


Getting back to possible solutions:

Looking at section 6.1, I see '[An entity-tag] can have any value,
except for "*".'  (Let's correct that to 'An entity-tag can be any
token, except for "*".')  We can dodge the problem of uncoordinated
notifiers by demanding that entity-tags have some minimum amount of
randomness.  E.g., if any group of coordinated notifiers picks a
64-bit random value, and the entity-tag is generated by making a
64-bit hash of that value with the event information, the chances of
an etag-value collision in any single instance is 2^-64.

One can easily encode a 64-bit value in 11 token characters using
(modified) base64.  Compare that to the 5-character values used as
examples in the I-D.  Though if we used 6 base64 characters, we would
still have a 36-bit hash, which is probably good enough.

   In any case, this text would probably end up being non-normative,
   which means it's not critical to flesh out in detail for a
   publication request.

I originally expected any text to be non-normative (since it was a
warning about an unavoidable danger), but after the random hashes came
up, it seems that it would be conceivable to specify a minimum
randomness content for entity-tags.  (We already have a randomness
requirement for to/from-tags.)

   A 1xx that establishes an early dialog must contain a contact or else 
   you really don't have a dialog. I think it is ambiguous whether:

   - the first 1xx with a particular to-tag *does* establish an early
      dialog and so *must* contain a contact,

   - OR a 1xx with a new to-tag, but without a contact, simply doesn't
      establish a dialog, but is legal.

   I would split the difference and say that the UAS MUST include a contact 
   in the first 1xx it returns with a particular to-tag, but a UAC should 
   accept a 1xx with new to-tag and without a contact and simply treat it 
   as not establishing an early dialog. (Don't establish the dialog until 
   you get enough info to do so.)

I'd say that it does create a dialog, but it's an anomalous dialog in
that you can't send any requests to it.  (Though it's unlikely that
you'd want to.)  But you might well get a final response from the
dialog, and you could get media from it.

I think it's the fact that the UAC is unlikely to send a request until
the dialog becomes confirmed is why we haven't worried about this case
much.
