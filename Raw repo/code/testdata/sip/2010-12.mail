Errata ID: 2602

Status: Reported
Type: Technical

Reported By: Fabio Pietrosanti
Date Reported: 2010-11-04

Section A.5.2 says:

      SDP Security Descriptions with SIPS
         Not applicable; SDP Security Descriptions does not have a long-
         term secret.

It should say:

      SDP Security Descriptions with SIPS
         The PFS feature of SDP Security Description with SIPS rely on
         TLS and the availability or not of PFS for SRTP calls depends
         on the negotiated TLS key negotiation algorithm.

         If the selected TLS key negotiation algorithm of SIPS provide
         PFS feature, then the underlying SRTP encryption will support
         PFS.  For example TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA provde PFS
         feature as described in RFC5246.  If the selected TLS key
         negotiation algorithm of SIPS does not provide PFS feature,
         then the underlying SRTP encryption will not support PFS.
         For example TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA does not provide PFS
         feature as described in RFC5246.


Notes:

It's not true that SDP Security Descriptions with SIPS have PFS "Not
applicable" because the SDES rely on TLS that is part of the security
scheme.

Practically if the long terms keys (the x509v3 RSA key of SIPS server)
is compromised, the TLS sessions can be decrypted, the SDES key
extracted and SRTP calls deciphered.

TLS support key exchange methods that provide PFS trough the use of
Ephemeral Diffie Hellman keys.

When SIPS use TLS with DHE key negotiation, then SDES acquire PFS
feature because even in case of long-term key compromise (the server
x509v3 RSA key), the short term keys (the SDES keys exchanged) will be
safe.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended status:  (correct) Verified (publish)
Should be reviewed by a security expert.

It seems that the entry for "SDP Security Descriptions with S/MIME" is
also incorrect, as revelation of the private keys of the participants
will render the SDES readable.  I think better phrasing of the revised
wording is:

      SDP Security Descriptions with SIPS
         PFS if the selected TLS cipher suites for the SIPS hops provide PF=
S.

      SDP Security Descriptions with S/MIME
         No PFS.

This needs to be reviewed by a security expert.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies
	Author(s)       : V. Hilt, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-08.txt
	Pages           : 37
	Date            : 2010-12-19

Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call
routing, rendezvous, and other call features.  This document
specifies a framework for SIP session policies that provides a
standard mechanism by which a proxy can define or influence policies
on sessions, such as the codecs or media types to be used.  It
defines a model, an overall architecture and new protocol mechanisms
for session policies.
