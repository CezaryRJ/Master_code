If there are no NATs in between the UA's then keepalive
is not very important.  However you can use SIP session
timer (RFC 4028) to check that the session is still active.

If there are NATs in between the UAs then you have to make
sure that some kind of keepalive is sent to keep the NAT
bindings open.  You could use SIP session timer for this too
but maybe the SIP session timer is a bit too heavy for keepalive
use.

You might want to consider the mechanisms in outbound-07:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-07.txt

See sections:
4.4.1.  Keepalive with TCP KEEPALIVE
and
4.4.2.  Keepalive with STUN

Hi..

I have a simple question..
When 2 SIP UAs have established a dialogue, and they want to exchange =
text =20
infomations..
However this text infomation exchange may be very infrequent, how does =
SIP =20
keepalive between the 2 UAs?
for example, 2 IM(Instance Message)
users may online but talk very infrequent,
--=20

Hi;
What you describe is the default procedure when you are using
STUN. But as you know, you con not relay just on STUN
to solve all the NAT problems. When the client is behind a symetric NAT
the "visible RTP port" will be relevant only from packets arriving from 
the STUN server.

The procedure you are describing does not provide a 100% reliable way to
get media connection established.

ICE is needed for many reasons:
* your MAPPED-ADDRESS/STUN will often provide wrong "port" number.
* it's very usefull to provide many options for direct media connection.
* ICE allow to exchange a media-relay address: this is helpfull when
   no direct connection is found because you know that when direct
   connection is not possible, 100% of calls will have media connection
   anyway.

ICE is the only reliable way to build an *optimized* service: ie a service 
which not provide media relay if not needed.

Also note that session timer is not needed between the two UA endpoints
of a session. Either one can initiate a sip message within the dialog
any time it thinks it might want to verify the session.

Yes, this procedure does not consider direct connections.  However, if 
you have a direct connection, which I am assuming is between two hosts 
that don't have a NAT between them, then this procedure is not 
relevant.  This procedure is focused on the situation where at least one 
of the UAs is behind a NAT.

As was mentioned, the procedure does not deal with media relay servers.

This procedure does have some of advantages over ICE.

First, its much simpler to implement.  If you have STUN client 
processing, you really just need to redirect who sends messages and 
record some response information and you're good to go (and some 
keepalives).  I know implementation complexity that is generally not a 
priority but it is an attribute of this procedure over ICE.  Second, it 
does not require the UA to implement STUN server processing.  Again, 
easier to implement but that may or may not be important.

Third, its probably quicker and lower overhead, i.e. you don't have to 
do all the STUN messaging, and all the combinations that are required 
for ICE.  It requires two STUN binding transactions and keepalives (and 
the keepalives are required in the ICE situation as well).  And the STUN 
transactions can be done at startup time so there's no overhead when a 
call setup occurs.  In my experience (which is open Internet, not direct 
connect and not Enterprise), direct connections are not relevant and 
Relay servers are often not available.  So, this procedure may not give 
you the "optimal" service in every situation, but I think it will be 
higher performance in response time and bandwidth in the case of a UA 
with a NAT in front of it getting to the Internet, a very common case.

Thanks,
FM

In addition to the problem with Address and Port-Dependent Mapping NATs
("Symmetric NATs"), which has already been mentioned, this technique also
requires NATs to support hairpinning (see
draft-jennings-behave-test-results-03.txt).

Little of ICE's complexity is due to TURN.

Frank, this has been looked at for a long time. The solution you propose 
was the original STUN mechanism in RFC 3489. It has numerous weaknesses 
that led to the development of ICE. Of course STUN alone is simpler. It 
also doesn't work well enough.

It fails in many cases:

1. if the NAT is of the symmetric variety, this doesn't work. It doesn't 
work even if the other party is on the public Internet.

2. If the caller and called parties are behind the same NAT, even if the 
NAT is not symmetric, there is a large percentage of NAT for which this 
won't work (NATs that don't hairpin)

(CC'ing sip and the authors of sip-outbound)

That couldn't have been an enjoyable way to have spent a few hours of your
day.  That NAT isn't compliant with BEHAVE, of course, which requires that
such application awareness be turned off for UDP protocols.  For exactly
this reason!

In order to deal with such a NAT with its application layer gateway (SPI)
turned on, it might be prudent for sip-outbound to discuss verifying such a
middlebox isn't dropping STUN packets on UDP/5060.  For example,
sip-outbound could encourage a SIP UA to revert to a less appealing
keepalive mechanism if the initial STUN Binding Request messages don't
result in STUN Binding Response messages.

I expect that same SPI would have dropped the PING method, so it might not
be useful to choose the PING method as the less-appealing keepalive
mechanism.  I expect you're stuck with ".<CR><LF>" or frequent re-Register
to get around such a NAT, but I'll leave that for others to decide.

A's UA should send a BYE for call leg between itself and B after sending
NOTIFY with status 200 OK, if it hasn't received a BYE from B before
then.

Perhaps my poor reading of 3489 is showing through here.  It was not 
clear to me in that draft that STUN should be multiplexed on both the 
SIP and RTP ports.  Forgive me if the use of STUN that I outlined here 
was implicit in the RFC.

Thanks,
FM

John,

I might add that even if hairpinning is supported, you may still run into 
problems if the NAT translates the external address back to an internal 
one
while an endpoint expects (and only accepts) packets from the external 
address, because that happens to be address with which it is 
communicating.

Cheers,

Frank

Re: [Sip] Simple procedure for NAT traversal for a UA
Classification







Frank, this has been looked at for a long time. The solution you propose 
was the original STUN mechanism in RFC 3489. It has numerous weaknesses 
that led to the development of ICE. Of course STUN alone is simpler. It 
also doesn't work well enough.

It fails in many cases:

1. if the NAT is of the symmetric variety, this doesn't work. It doesn't 
work even if the other party is on the public Internet.

2. If the caller and called parties are behind the same NAT, even if the 
NAT is not symmetric, there is a large percentage of NAT for which this 
won't work (NATs that don't hairpin)

&gt; Yes, this procedure does not consider direct connections. &nbsp;However,

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This procedure does have some of advantages over ICE.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; First, its much simpler to implement. &nbsp;If you have STUN client

(and <br>

the STUN <br>

not direct <br>

<br>
&gt; Relay servers are often not available. &nbsp;So, this procedure may
not give <br>
&gt; you the &quot;optimal&quot; service in every situation, but I think
it will be <br>

this seems to be in quite wide use. Also worth noting is rport (3581), 
which can be used to achieve a similar result for signaling (learn the 
public binding via rport and then send an updated registration). Rport 
has of course similar drawbacks as STUN (i.e. you don't really know 
whether others can reach your public contact or not, which is pretty 
bad from service deployment point of view).

I'm not sure which is more common in pre-outbound/ICE clients, rport+STUN or
STUN+STUN (signaling+RTP/SDP).

Hi,

 

Does anybody know if there are any traces of real world / larger deployments
of SIP/IMS systems available? We would need some traces do analyse them. It
would be amazing if we could get our hand on traffic with and without the
use of SigComp or other compression mechanisms.

 

Best,

 

Christian

Folks,

I have updated my "Routing of mid dialog requests using sip outbound"
draft
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-johns-sip-outbound-middialog-
draft-02.txt). This updated version builds on the previous version by
expanding the use case. The new use cases no longer assumes the UE
registers through all Edge Proxies associated with a Registrar. This now
requires mechanisms for the registrar to identify which Edge Proxies can
handle a mid-dialog request when the Edge Proxy used to establish the
dialog has failed.

Feedback and suggestions welcome.

Kevin

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


	Title		: Routing of mid dialog requests using
sip-outbound

This document describes a solution for routing of mid-dialog requests
   in the presence of NATs.  The solution leverages and extends the
   concepts described in the Internet Draft titled Managing Client
   Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol.  This
   solution is necessary to support routing of mid-dialog requests while
   preserving Edge Proxy failover within an outbound-proxy-set.

Jonathan,

I noticed a slight inconsistency in your draft:

Section 5 states:

  "This "ice" OPTION tag SHOULD NOT be used in conjunction with the
   Supported header field.  The media feature tag is used as the one and
   only mechanism for indicating support for ICE.  The option tag is
   meant to be used only with the Require header field."

But section 7.1 says:

  "Description: This option tag is used to identify the Interactive
     Connectivity Establishment (ICE) extension.  When present in a
     Supported header field, it indicates that ICE is supported by an
     agent."

Would it be possible to reformulate the IANA considerations such that it
aligns with section 5?

Regards,

Ernst Horvath

Steve,

I would have appreciated some discussion of the relationship of this to TLS
server authentication and mutual authentication. Presumably the benefit of
this is that it can be used for authentication when there is more than one
hop between the UA and the server.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

After the big discussions on SIPPING last summer about how to fix early 
media, and the reaction at the last couple of IETFs to Brian Stucker's 
draft on how to cope with it, I've put together a draft to try to 
consolidate all of the discussions and move toward a solution.

draft-barnes-sip-em-ps-req-sol includes three important parts:

1. Problem statement: Although there's lots of definitions of "early 
media" in existing documents, I think there's broad agreement that the 
stuff that causes problems is media that arrives before an SDP 
offer/answer exchange has completed.  The problem is therefore to enable 
the SDP exchange(s) in the INVITE transaction to complete more quickly, 
and make it more difficult (if not impossible) to send media before it 
has completed.  We are explicitly NOT trying to prevent the sending of 
media before a 200/OK or other closing of an INVITE transaction.

2. Requirements: Here, we try to create a consolidated list of 
requirements for an early media fix.

3. Analysis of Solutions: Lots of folks have put forward proposals to 
fix the early media problem.  This section tries to enumerate most of 
them and evaluate them against the requirements in section 2.

It hasn't shown up yet on the I-D tracker, so I've attached a copy.

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) enables and permits endpoints
   in an INVITE transaction to send media packets before an SDP offer/
   answer exchange has completed; we refer to such media packets as
   early media.  The use of early media is common in current SIP
   implementations, and causes several problems, which have been
   documented elsewhere.  This document puts forward the goal of
   modifying SIP so that compliant implementations will complete an SDP

   exchange before sending media, and lays out high-level requirements
   for such a solution.  The set of possible solutions is then laid out,

1.  Introduction

   A primary function of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP,
   [RFC3261]) is to carry SDP messages that form an SDP offer/answer
   exchange [RFC3264].  The offer/answer exchange serves to negotiate
   the parameters necessary for the two end hosts to send multimedia to
   each other, including transports, port numbers, codecs, and security
   parameters (e.g., MIKEY [RFC3830]).  In the most common SIP INVITE
   transaction, the calling party (UAC) is the SDP offerer and the
   called party (UAS) is the SDP answerer; in this scenario, the SDP
   offer is carried in the SIP INVITE request, and the SDP answer in the
   200/OK response.

   Because there is often a substantial delay between the sending of an
   INVITE and the receipt a 200/OK, this assignment of SDP messages to
   SIP messages creates a substantial delay between an SDP offer and an
   SDP answer.  Consequently, there is a period of time between the two
   messages in which the two parties have asymmetric information: The
   called party has knowledge of both the SDP offered by the calling
   party and of his own intended response, while the calling party knows
   only the offer he sent.  Given this information, the called party has
   all the information he needs to begin sending media to the calling
   party (because this was included in the SDP offer); moreover, he can
   send these media without sending an SDP answer to the calling party.
   We define early media as media sent before the completion of an SDP
   offer/answer exchange.

   Ours is a different definition than is used in RFC 3960 [RFC3960],
   which defines early media as "media ... that is exchanged before a
   particular session is accepted by the called user."  The definition
   in RFC 3960 is consistent with the current usage of SDP within the
   SIP INVITE transaction, but at the same time conflates two functions
   of SIP: Negotiation of session-layer parameters (through the SDP
   offer/answer) and communication of an application-layer request and
   acceptance of a session (by the INVITE and 200/OK messages).  As
   suggested above, it is this assignment of SDP messages to SIP
   messages that creates the possibility of early media.

   Early media is known to create several problems for SIP operation:

   o  Call failure: When endpoints use early media for an extended
      period of time, timers can fire to close the UAC INVITE
      transaction before the early media finish and the UAS sends a
      200/OK.  This causes the session proposed in the initial INVITE to
      be dropped by the UAC, and in some implementations, the flow of
      media is cut off.

Internet-Draft                em-ps-req-sol                 January 2007


   o  Confidentiality: Techniques such as MIKEY [RFC3830]and Security
      Descriptions [RFC4568], which use SDP to establish keys for media
      security protocols, require a full SDP offer/answer exchange to
      negotiate keys.  Such keying techniques are therefore incompatible
      with early media.

   o  Access Control: In the presence of early media, a UAC must
      anticipate that media will arrive without any signaling, and thus
      is obliged to receive (and presumably render) media received from
      any host on the Internet.

   o  Interaction with forking/retargeting: When an INVITE from a UAC is
      forked or retarget to UASs that send early media, because these
      UASs send no signaling, the UAC has no information besides the
      media itself on which to base a decision as to which media stream
      to render.

   o  Denial of Service: Early media is the basis of the "voice hammer"
      attack, described in [draft-ietf-mmusic-ice].

   To date, attempts to deal with early media have failed to solve all
   of the problems caused by early media.  Such work typically has
   started from the assumption that early media is a necessary component
   of SIP (largely due to RFC 3398 [RFC3398] and RFC 3578 [RFC3578]) and
   has generally avoided the issue of whether key use-cases (such as
   PSTN interoperability) can be satisfied without the use of early
   media.  RFC 3960 presents two models for managing early media
   streams, which mitigate early-media related problems in some cases.
   However, the document neither specifies the models in sufficient
   detail nor makes their implementation a mandatory part of SIP.  More
   recently, Stucker has written a draft extending 3960 by detailing a
   more current set of early media coping mechanisms, and proposing a
   solution that uses additional SDP attributes to mitigate the problems
   caused by early media [draft-stucker-sipping-early-media-coping].
   Although Stucker's proposed solution addresses several of the above
   problems, it stops short of requiring an SDP exchange before media
   transmission.  Ejzak has also authored a recent draft regarding early
   media [draft-ejzak-sipping-p-em-auth].  However, his draft proposes
   the use of a p-header to prevent fraudulent uses of early media,
   which are largely orthogonal to the early media problems considered
   in this draft.

   In contrast to previous approaches, this draft proposes to address
   the problems of early media by normatively modifying the SIP protocol
   to preclude the transmission of early media.  In order to remove the
   possibility of early media, this modification must ensure (to the
   greatest extent possible) that the SDP offer/answer exchange has
   completed before any media are sent.  At a high level, this goal can

Internet-Draft                em-ps-req-sol                 January 2007


   be approached from two directions: To complete the SDP exchange as
   quickly and reliably as possible, and to forbid sending of media
   before completion.  A successful solution will combine these two
   approaches, since as progress is made on the former, the latter
   becomes less onerous.

   The goal of this draft is three-fold: First, in the above, we have
   provided a consolidated statement of the early media problem, namely
   that the presence of media before the completion of an SDP offer/
   answer exchange is harmful to the functioning of SIP calls.  Second,
   Section 2 specifies requirements for an update to SIP that eliminates
   early media, in an effort to consolidate the requirements that have
   been presented to date and enable discussion of solutions.  Third,
   Section 3 lays out the space of possible solutions, enumerating the
   trade-offs entailed by each so that consensus can be reached on the
   direction that should be taken by the SIP working group.


2.  Requirements

   There have been several informal proposals to date that would
   mitigate or eliminate early media, but each was disqualified in turn
   by requirements as perceived by the SIP and SIPPING working groups.
   In this section, we seek to create a consolidated set of requirements
   so that a consistent evaluation of solutions can move forward.
   Below, we use the term "proposed solution" to refer to a protocol
   that normatively updates the relevant standards (e.g., RFCs 3261,
   3264, and 3398) in such a way as to eliminate early media, while we
   use the term "current SIP" to refer to SIP as defined in RFC 3261 and
   related documents.

2.1.  Elmination of Early Media

   The proposed solution must define a normative modification to the SIP
   protocol (and other relevant protocols) that minimizes or eliminates
   the possibility of early media in SIP sessions; i.e., it should
   minimize or eliminate the possibility that a compliant implementation
   could send media before an SDP offer/answer exchange has completed.
   Solutions in which receipt of SDP-bearing messages is explicitly
   acknowledged (e.g., an INVITE/200/ACK or INVITE/180/PRACK exchange)
   are preferred, since these acknowledgements are the only way to
   completely eliminate early media (otherwise the answerer cannot know
   with certainty that the offerer has received his answer).  If a
   proposed solution does not include such acknowledgements, it must
   define UAS behaviors that minimize the probability of the UAS sending
   media before the UAC has received the SDP answer.

2.2.  Additional Messaging

   In order to minimize the impact of the proposed solution on call-
   setup times, the proposed solution should minimize the number of
   signaling messages that are required in addition to those used by
   current SIP.  Proposed solutions should accommodate the fact that
   messages sent "on the media path" (i.e. directly between the two SIP
   endpoints) will often be unable to reach their destinations due to
   current media gating techniques.

2.3.  Interoperability with current SIP standards

   The proposed solution must define how entities implementing it will
   interact with entities that implement the current SIP protocol.  The
   proposed solution should minimize the set of conditions under which a
   call would fail in such a hybrid scenario, but not in a scenario in
   which both endpoints use current SIP.

2.4.  Interoperability with the PSTN

   The proposed solution must be compatible with the creation of
   gateways to the PSTN, and may define normative updates as necessary
   to RFC 3398 and RFC 3578.

2.5.  Denial of Service

   The proposed solution must minimize the possibility of new denial of
   service attacks by minimizing the amount of state that is kept by a
   UAS prior to the completion of an offer/answer exchange.  Ideally, no
   state in addition to the SIP INVITE state machine will be required
   (i.e., the initial SDP offer/answer will be conducted statelessly).

2.6.  IPR Constraints

   The proposed solution must, to the extent possible, avoid dependence
   on technologies on which there are known IPR constraints, as this
   tends to hinder adoption.


3.  Early Media Solutions

   The fundamental goal of a system to eliminate early media is to
   ensure that an SDP offer/answer exchange has completed before media
   packets are sent.  Such a system will combine two approaches:
   Completing the SDP exchange as quickly and reliably as possible, and
   providing restrictions on the sending and receiving of media before
   such completion.  A priori, neither approach is at odds with the
   requirements stated above, so we explore the possible mechanisms for

Internet-Draft                em-ps-req-sol                 January 2007


   accomplishing each.  Many of the solutions below have been suggested
   on the SIP and SIPPING mailing lists already, sometimes by multiple
   people independently; we have not made an effort to attribute them.

3.1.  Minimizing SDP completion time

   The simplest way to preclude early media is for the SIP endpoints to
   ensure that an SDP exchange has completed before media packets are
   generated.  In order to convey the SDP messages comprising this
   exchange, it is necessary to modify the way that SDP messages are
   carried within SIP session establishment.  There are a variety of
   mechanisms for achieving this goal, including modifications to
   messages within the INVITE transaction, other non-INVITE SIP
   mechanisms, and protocols outside of SIP.

3.1.1.  Fast completion of INVITE transaction

   Perhaps the most straightforward approach to quickly completing an
   SDP offer/answer exchange would be to simply complete the SDP
   exchange already inherent in the SIP INVITE transaction more quickly:
   To do this, the UAS would send a 200/OK response as soon as an INVITE
   message is received, rather than awaiting an indication from a higher
   layer to do so (formally, this moves both the client and server
   INVITE transactions to the Terminated state as quickly as possible).
   In essence, this is a change to the semantic meaning of the "200/OK"
   response; rather than indicating that an application-layer session
   has begun, it would indicate that an media association had been
   established, in the sense that all necessary parameters are
   established for media to flow.  A separate message (for instance, an
   UPDATE [RFC3311]) could be used to indicate that an application-layer
   user is ready to begin exchanging media.

   Quickly completing the INVITE transaction has the potential to
   eliminate early media entirely: Because the 200 response is
   explicitly acknowledged by the ACK message, both endpoints can be
   sure that the SDP exchange is complete when the ACK is transmitted.
   In ISUP terms, a 200/OK response used in this way would correspond to
   an ACM (rather than to an ANM, as in RFC 3398), and the UPDATE (or
   similar message) would correspond to the ANM.  The failing of this
   approach is its interaction with SIP forking: Since a 200/OK message
   moves both endpoints to the Terminated state, the first UAS to
   respond would automatically cut off all other branches of the call.
   Although this issue could likely be resolved with a modification to
   rules for SIP forking, it could inhibit backward compatibility in the
   interim.

3.1.2.  Elimination of offer from INVITE

   One way to ensure that a UAS cannot send media until an SDP exchange
   has completed would be to forbid a UAC from including an SDP offer in
   its INVITE message, so that the SDP offer would be sent by the UAS in
   either a reliable provisional response or the 200/OK message, and the
   answer in the UAC's PRACK or ACK message.  This behavior is allowed
   by current SIP, but does not eliminate early media because it is not
   mandatory.  At first blush, reusing the existing INVITE transaction
   in this way seems appealing: Because it is a subset of behaviors
   allowed by current SIP, it will interact well with current SIP
   endpoints, and it introduces no additional messaging or state
   machinery.  However, if either endpoint does not support reliable
   provisional responses [RFC3262], this solution would prevent any
   media flows before the sending of a 200/OK (distinct from an SDP
   answer), which would cause many existing SIP applications to fail
   (including a large number of PSTN applications as they pass through
   gateways).  In addition, the ACK message is not a reliable mechanism
   for transporting SDP answers, since the UAC (as an SDP answerer)
   receives no notification that the UAS has received its answer.

3.1.3.  Provisional Responses

   Within the INVITE transaction, the only other messages sent from UAS
   to UAC (besides the INVITE, 200, and ACK messages) that could carry
   SDP information are provisional (101-199) responses (response type
   100 is excepted because it is often not retransmitted by proxies).
   Upon receipt of an INVITE message, a UAS would respond with a 1xx
   message that would complete the SDP offer/answer.  Some have
   suggested use of the 183 (Call Progress) message for this purpose, as
   is done in ICE, though another existing or new response type could in
   principle be used.

   This approach has the advantage that if the UAS does not support this
   use of provisional messages, then the call will proceed in the same
   way as with current SIP.  For PSTN gateways, this approach only
   requires the sending or understanding a single additional message.
   However, it would be difficult to use provisional responses to
   eliminate early media, since this would require them to be reliable.
   Though there exist both SIP (PRACK) and non-SIP (ICE binding request)
   messages that can acknowledge provisional responses, AT&T holds IPR
   related to reliable provisional responses.  This has limited the
   deployment of PRACK, and may have the same effect on relevant
   portions of ICE.

Internet-Draft                em-ps-req-sol                 January 2007


3.1.4.  Separate INVITE transaction

   The Application Server model of RFC 3960 provides an SDP exchange for
   early media by conducting separate INVITE transactions for an "Early"
   session and for the "Final" session.  In a recently proposed
   realization and extension of this model
   [draft-stucker-sipping-early-media-indirection], any entity along the
   signaling path can include an EMIND (Early Media Indirection) header
   that will prompt the UAC to initiate a separate INVITE transaction
   with a third entity, e.g., a media server to provide ring-back tones
   or balance announcements.  This transaction establishes an "Early
   Session," which is terminated when the orignal INVITE transaction is
   completed and the "Final Session" begun.

   Using a separate INVITE transaction for early media has several
   advantages: Since the answer in a 2xx response triggers an ACK in the
   early INVITE transaction, it can be used to completely prevent early
   media.  Prospects for interoperability with current SIP
   implementations are good, since no new mechanisms are employed; in
   particular, the EMIND header will be ignored by implementations that
   do not support it.  And the entire burden of state maintenance is
   placed on the UAC, which must manage both INVITE transactions.
   However, using two separate INVITE transactions incurs significant
   siganling overhead, and it is unclear that this approach, at least as
   currently specified, can eliminate early media from PSTN gateways
   that are unable to separate early and regular media.

3.1.5.  Non-INVITE SIP Mechanisms

   There are other SIP messages that could be used to carry an SDP
   answer that would be formally outside of the INVITE transaction, but
   could be contemporaneous with it.  Because these messages would be
   outside the INVITE transaction, a separate mechanism may be required
   to associate the transmitted SDP answer with the SDP offer in the
   INVITE request.

3.1.5.1.  INFO and UPDATE

   The SIP INFO method [RFC2976] is currently used to convey additional
   signaling information in the middle of a session, after the INVITE
   transaction has terminated.  However, it could also be used to convey
   information relevant to an INVITE transaction, subject to the
   constraint in RFC 2976 that an INFO request must not change the state
   of a SIP call.  While receipt of an SDP answer in an INFO request
   would change state at the TU layer (namely, in the UAC core), it
   would not change the transaction-layer state of the call.  INFO
   messages carrying SDP answers can be associated with the
   corresponding SDP offer by virtue of the fact that the INFO message



Barnes & Lepinski         Expires July 19, 2007                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                em-ps-req-sol                 January 2007


   carrying the answer will carry the same Call-ID as the INVITE message
   carrying the offer.  The SIP UPDATE method [RFC3311]could be likewise
   used (in fact, RFC 3311 lists early media as the main motivation for
   UPDATE, and RFC 3960 uses UPDATE messages as the basis for its
   gateway model).

   Current standards require that the UAS in an INFO or UPDATE
   transaction to send a response to an INFO or UPDATE message, so these
   messages would provide a reliable transport for SDP answers.  Just as
   with provisional responses, using INFO or UPDATE messages to convey
   SDP answers is backwards-compatible, and requires minimal
   modification to PSTN gateways.  One potential drawback is that as
   currently specified, UPDATE and INFO messages cannot be sent before a
   dialog is established (i.e., a 101-199 response is sent).  If not
   changed or lifted by the proposed solution, this restriction could
   limit the efficacy of UPDATE (or INFO) for quickly concluding an SDP
   exchange, since the required 1xx message would introduce additional
   delay in the transmission of the SDP answer.

3.1.5.2.  Other Response Codes

   In current SIP, if a UAS wishes to send early media in response to an
   INVITE, it will send the media without any SIP response.  As an
   alternative, the UAS wishing to send early media could send a 401
   response requiring http-auth with null authentication.  The UAC would
   then signal its willingness to receive the media by sending a new
   INVITE (with the nonce for null authentication).  In this model, the
   UAS's SDP answer would be sent in its 401 response, and the UAC's re-
   INVITE would confirm receipt of this answer.

   Although this proposal does provide a reliable transport for SDP
   answers, it has significant drawbacks: In addition to adding
   significant messaging overhead, it requires both endpoints to
   maintain state across INVITE transactions (in addition to the nonce
   required by null authentication).  And the prospects for backward
   compatibility with this solution are bleak: All calls to current SIP
   endpoints will fail unless the endpoints support the indicated
   authentication mechanisms, and forked calls would show unpredictable
   behavior due to the Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem
   (HERFP).

3.1.6.  Non-SIP mechanisms

   There are some proposals to use protocols other than SIP to resolve
   the problem of early media in SIP.  For instance, a lower-level
   protocol could be defined that could negotiate and SDP session that
   could then be used by SIP, much as TLS negotiations are conducted
   before HTTPS data are sent.  However, such a protocol would have to



Barnes & Lepinski         Expires July 19, 2007                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                em-ps-req-sol                 January 2007


   duplicate many SIP features, and any such solution would require SIP
   entities to implement an additional protocol stack, which would have
   negative consequences for backward-compatability and PSTN
   interoperability.

3.2.  Handling remaining media

   Early media can be completely eliminated only if neither party sends
   media until it is assured that the SDP offer/answer exchange is
   completed.  Of course, this is only possible when both endpoints
   support the proposed solution and the SDP answer is carried in a
   reliable message: In this optimal case, both the offerer and the
   answerer must not send media until they have received assurance that
   the SDP exchange has completed.  The proposed solution will specify
   the two remaining cases.

3.2.1.  Unreliable SDP answer

   If both endpoints support the solution, but the solution uses an
   unreliable message to carry the SDP answer, then the offerer can be
   assured that the SDP exchange has completed (because he has received
   the answer), but the answerer cannot.  In this case, the offerer must
   not send media until the SDP exchange has completed.  The proposed
   solution should provide an explicit, deterministic criterion for when
   the answerer may send media: For instance, the answerer may be free
   to send media after it receives media from the offerer, or after a
   timer fires that is set when the answer is sent.

3.2.2.  Backwards-compatibility

   Depending on the nature of the proposed solution, one party may not
   be able to know whether the other supports the solution.  If a party
   cannot know, then it must behave as if the other party does support
   the solution (otherwise, the solution would never be used).  If a
   party can be aware of the other party's support, then the solution
   should allow a supporting party to knowingly send early media to an
   non-supporting party, since to do otherwise -- to mandate that a
   supporting party behave as it would if the other party supported the
   solution -- is incompatible with existing SIP applications that use
   early media.  Nonetheless, an implementation of the solution should
   always avoid the use of early media; it should only send early media
   when it has received early media from a non-supporting endpoint.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Richard, Matt,

Thanks for producing this draft. I am not sure whether we will be able to
find an acceptable solution, but I think it is worth having the discussion.
A few comments:

1. I have heard the term "early arriving media" used in the context of
discussions on the RTPSEC list. It might be useful to adopt this term for
the purposes of your paper.

2. Another problematic case concerns serial forking. A proxy is scripted to
forward a request to B and then, if B does not answer within a certain time,
cancel the request to B and forward the request to C. If B is sending early
media and does not respond promptly to the CANCEL request, early media from
B could interfere with more relevant early media from C. I realise that it
is outside the scope of your proposal to cover this, but it is worth
mentioning.

3. I seem to recall coming across B2BUAs that send ACK without waiting for
the arrival of the ACK from the real UAC. I guess we can't legislate for
such behaviour.

4. If RFC 3398 will need updating, it is likely that RFC 4497 will need
updating too.

5. I can't find draft-stucker-sipping-early-media-indirection in the
archives - the date of Oct 2006 suggests that it should not have expired
yet.

6. The text in 3.1.4 first paragraph seems misleading. RFC 3960 does not use
separate INVITE transactions. It merely uses separate offer-answer exchanges
with different content-dispositions.

7. In section 3.1.5.1, I don't think it correctly captures the existing
constraints on sending SDP offers in parallel with an INVITE transaction. An
SDP offer is allowed in an UPDATE request already, but only if the existing
SDP offer-answer exchange (started in the INVITE request or the first
reliable 1xx response) has completed. However, I am not sure how this rule
would apply if the content-disposition were different from the normal.

8. In section 3.2.1, there may be situations where media sent by the
answerer cannot get through a NAT/firewall until media has been received
from the offerer. Of course, ICE would sort this out, but without ICE I
don't think this is a reliable solution.

John

I want to draw attention to the up-issue of the sips draft.
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sips-01.txt

Here is a summary of the main changes changes:

- More clarification on using TLS with SIP instead of SIPS. Added a call
  flow 9.3 to illustrate it.

- In -00, if an endpoint registed with a SIP Contact or a SIPS Contact,
the proxy
  would forward incoming request to that UAS using the scheme of the
contact
  as opposed to preserve the scheme used in the request. In other words,
it
  "upgraded" or "downgraded" the scheme based on what was used in
Registration in
  the Contact. That introduced a whole bunch of issues with mid-dialog
requests. For
  example, if an Endpoint registered with a SIPS contact, an incoming
request
  sent using a SIP Request-URI would be upgraded to SIPS by the
terminating proxy.
  Upon accepting the request, the UAS would then have to use a SIPS
contact (as per
  RFC 3261) which would most likely not be understood by the
  other side, and would create problem with sending mid-dialog requests
such
  as ACK. In -01, the proxy is expected to leave the Request-URI scheme
intact when
  delivering the request. This will fix the problem described above.
Also, it
  correctly indicates to the UAS that the request was NOT sent using
SIPS on every
  hop. Please review carefully this change, and the implications on the=20
  call flows in section 9 to ensure that it is correct. This change
fixes
  lots of problems with -00.

- When a request is rejected, a 403 Forbidden is used instead of 416
"Unrecognized
  URI scheme". The rationale is that RFC 3261 says that when you get a
416, you
  should retry with SIP URI scheme which would then loop. If anybody
believes a
  different error response should be used, please speak up.

- I cleaned up the description of loose routing implications of sips.
The -00 draft
  was saying that SIPS meant TLS for loose routes, but the -01 explains
that it really
  means, well, SIPS.

- Corrected a bunch of mistakes in the call flows.

The To-be-done section contains a bunch of open issues.

- One open issue regards how to deal with SIP URIs in REFER and 3rd
party call
  control. I'm not convinced that writing very detailed procedures makes
much sense=20
  as it could get overly complicated. Somehow, I think we need some
high-level=20
  statement about not allowing "derived connections" (such as one
obtained when
  REFER or 3rd-party call control) to effectively downgrade from SIPS to
SIP.
  Anyboy has any toughts on the issue?

- The other open issue is about GRUU.  How should the UAC react if the
returned=20
  GRUU is SIP but	the To was SIPS? How should the UAC react if the
returned=20
  GRUU is SIPS but the To was SIP? Any ideas? (Maybe we can be a bit
more
  prescriptive here).

Done, by rewriting the sentence to

" This document uses the term "conveyance" to describe scenarios in which a 
SIP user agent client (UAC) is telling or informing a user agent server 
(UAS) where the UAC is.  This is different from a UAC asking or seeking the 
location of where the UAS is.  Conveyance is a push model, where seeking is 
a pull model, and therefore not discussed here."

Done, by removing the ID-ERROR ref and pointing to sec 3.4 where the new 
Warning codes were added.

done

Done, by changing every reference to "coordinate" format.

Regarding LoST and 4119, this doc cannot control either of their wordings

>(Also, consider adding a space between RFC and 4119.)

Fixed for all RFCs mentioned

I agree, and changed the SHOULD to a should.

>capitolized.

fixed


>Section 3.4.4
>----------------
>The first sentance is missing a comma and should read:
>"... means the location provided, whether by-value or by-reference, in a 
>request is not well formed."

fixed


>Section 3.4.5
>----------------
>I found the second paragraph to be unclear. Consider re-wording it as follows:
>"A typical reaction to receiving this warning code is for the location 
>sender to verify that it has indeed included location information in the

reworded as requested here


>Section 3.4.6
>----------------
>In the second paragraph, consider changing 'error' to 'warning code' for 
>consistancy.

done


>Section 3.4.7
>----------------
>Consider re-wording the second paragraph as follows:
>"A typical reaction to receiving this warning code is for the location 
>sender to convey more information, if doing so is allowed by local policy."

done - and added the word 'location' in front of "information" for 
clarification of what type of info is to be sent.


>Section 3.4.12
>-----------------
>In the second paragraph, consider changing 'error' to 'warning code' for 
>consistancy.

done


>Section 3.6
>--------------
>In the last sentance of the first paragraph, consider adding a space 
>between RFC and 3693.

done for all RFCs


>I had trouble understanding the first sentance of the second paragraph. 
>Consider a re-wording such as:
>"... treating the URI as a presence URI and dereferencing it by sending a 
>SUBSCRIBE request to a presence server as per [RFC3856]."

Done as suggested


>In the last sentance of the third paragraph, add the word 'is' before the 
>phrase 'the purpose of this extension'

done


>Section 5
>-----------
>In the fourth paragraph, add the word 'a' between 'for protecting' and 'PIDF'
>
>Consider rewording the first sentance of the last paragraph as follows:
>"... in the same SIP message, so long as each is in a separate message 
>body part."

both done


>Section 5.1
>-------------
>In the first sentance of the third paragraph, consider adding the phrase 
>'or wish to convey' between 'does not know' and 'its location at this time'.

done


>In sentance three of paragraph five, I find the phrase 'learn from the 
>Warning code' to be unclear. Consider re-wording the sentance as follows:
>"Upon receiving an error response, the UAC SHOULD take appropriate steps 
>based on the warning code before attempting to convey location again."

done


>I had trouble with the final paragraph of this section. I understand that

>this notion.

fixed by adding "A UAC subscribing to a UAS for its location is a better 
means of acquiring the UAS's location.  This is a seeking or pull model 
scenario, which is not defined here, and left for future study."


>Section 5.2
>--------------
>Consider re-wording the first sentance of the first paragraph as follows:
>"... is present, the type of URI contained in the header field will 
>indicate if location ..."

done


>In the first sentance of the second paragraph, consider changing "or error 
>the message" to "or else send an error response"

done


>Section 5.3
>-------------
>Consider re-wording the first sentance of the first paragraph as follows:
>"Proxies that perform location-based routing may need to consult external 
>databases or systems to determine the route."

I think you mean the 1st sentence of the fourth paragraph, not the first. I 
fixed that sentence in paragraph 4.


>Section 5.3.1
>----------------
>In the first sentance of the first paragraph, consider adding the word 
>'geolocation' between 'any existing' and 'header'.

done


>The first paragraph indicates that any existing header parameter MUST NOT 
>be modified or deleted by a proxy. However, the last paragraph describes a 
>case where the proxy MUST remove the incoming 
>"message-routed-on-this-uri". If "message-routed-on-this-uri" is a header

Agreed, so I changed the paragraph to:

" When a message traverses a SIP intermediary, any existing Geolocation 
header value (URI or header parameter) MUST NOT be  deleted.  A Geolocation 
header value (URI or header parameter) MAY only be modified to indicate if 
the message was routed based on a specific geolocation URI.  Further 
modification of this Geolocation header MUST NOT occur.  For example:..."

Thanks!

I would like to draw your attention to a new Internet Draft,
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-so
l-00.txt
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-s
ol-00.txt>=20
=20
This document specifies SIP Certificate Authentication (SCA), a
challenge-response mechanism that uses public key cryptography to
perform certificate-based authentication in Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) based architectures.  Performing authentication in SIP with
certificates will provide stronger authentication capabilities and
increase possible deployment scenarios in SIP networks.  The scope is
limited to the authentication of the SIP UA to the SIP Service
Provider's network.  It does not include UA to UA authentication within
its scope.

=20

This document is based on the requirements listed in
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-01
.txt. Please provide feedback on both the technical content and the
concept itself.

=20

Thanks,

Steve.

Hi Jonathan,

I have been studying
draft-rosenberg-sip-outbound-discovery-mid-dialog-00
and find that the way it suggests to construct and use the Path URI is
not
totally consistent within the spec.

>From the example in Chapter 15, the reader can get an impression that
the Path URI would be identical for all the outbound proxies within
the proxy set assigned to the user:

   Finally, it extracts the URI from the Alternative-Proxies header
   field, which points to proxy 3.  It runs through an identical
   registration procedure with proxy 3.  This procedure will leave the
   UA with two outbound proxies, both of which have exactly the same
   URI.  Its connection table will look like:

   TLS connection to 2:
     sip:outbound.example.com
=20
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun

   TCP connection to 3:
=20
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;maddr=3D192.0.2.1
=20
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun

In this example the URI for proxy 2 and 3 seem to be identical and
the user part of it would have the following properties:

- It encodes all the proxies in the outbound proxy set.
  Furthermore those proxies are there in the same order.

- However the reg-id seems to be incorrectly '1' for both the
registrations.


But reading the normative text it would seem that the user part of the
Path URI would be different for each of the outbound proxies:

- When encoding the user part the proxy would not include itself,
  it would only include the other proxies of the proxy set.

- The reg-id would be different for each proxy.


It seems to me that there would actually be two options how to
use construct the URIs for Path, Service-Route and Record-Route=20
headers in this draft:

1. To have each proxy to construct a different Path URI so that
   the user part of the Path URI would be specific to one single
   flow between the UA and the outbound proxy. The differentiation
   would be done by including the reg-id to the encoding of the=20
   user part (and possibly proxy not including itself to the proxy set).

2. To have each proxy within the proxy set construct an identical
   Path URI so that the Path URI would be common to all flows
   maintained by the UA towards the proxy set. This would mean
   not using the reg-id when encoding the user part of the URI
   and using the whole proxy set for the encoding.

Using the reflected Path URI within both the Service-Route
and Alternative-Proxies headers, it would seem to me that the
option 2 would be the correct way out of those.

For the option 1 (different Path URI for each proxy) there seem to=20
be the following issues:

- The Service-Route header within the 200 OK response of REGISTER
  would be different for each proxy. I belive there should be only
  one single URI to be used within each Service-Route header,
  irrespective of the proxy used.

- The normative text for Alternative-Proxies seem to assume that
  all the alternative proxies would have same URI but different
  maddr parameter to identify the specific proxy. This same URI
  should be the one single common Path URI for the proxy set.

- If the Path URI is not common to the proxy set but each flow
  maintained by the UA would have a different Path URI, then
  why would the Record-Route need to have an additional=20
  dialog-specific URI parameter ? I assumed this parameter was
  needed to identify a single specific flow amongst the set of=20
  flows when all flows within the set would have the common Path=20
  URI. But if the Path URI already maps to a single flow then
  what would be the purpose of the dialog-specific URI parameter ?

- Even if suggesting the usage of reg-id within the user part
  of the Path URI, the draft does not suggest any use for this=20
  piece of information to any purpose.=20

- The proxies would need complicated procedures in mid-dialog
  failover case to find the correct flow to the same user and UA.
  When having a common Path URI for all the flows and proxies,
  finding the correct flow would become trivial even for the
  mid-dialog failover case. The new proxy would just have to
  ignore the dialog-specific URI parameter.


Having the Path URI to be identical for all flows maintained
by the UA instance, the "stickiness" properties
of the Record-Routed URI would finally be as follows:

- URI + dialog-specific parameter: map to one single flow and proxy
- URI (user and host parts included): map to all flows from the UA
- host part of the URI: map to the ob proxy farm of the domain

Regards,

Erkki

Hi,

I haven't had time to read the document yet, but I am not sure I agree
with the statement saying that the biggest problem is media arriving
before the SDP answer. In some environments such media will not even
reach the terminal, due to gating etc.

Many implementations DO send an SDP answer (or, at least an unreliable
"preview" of the SDP answer) before (or at the same time as) early media
is sent.

And, in the cases where implementations do NOT send an SDP answer before
they start sending early media - what behavior would you be able to
standardize?

Regards,

Christer=20

Perhaps a better term would be "media sent before an SDP answer has been 
received".  As you point out, sending media before an SDP offer/answer 
exchange has completed poses the risk that that media will not arrive. 
To put it in the terms used in the document, media clipping is a problem 
caused by early (pre-SDP-answer) media, and thus one which this document 
seeks to solve.

This is the behavior we would like to standardize -- that an SDP answer 
is *always* sent before media of any type.  What we're trying to do with 
this document is describe the requirements for how that answer is sent, 
and consolidate the many ways people have proposed to send it.

We would prefer that standards not allow this behavior -- that seems 
like the right thing to me.  What's a little trickier is that you'd like 
to not have the answerer sending media before the answer has *arrived*. 
  When the answer is carried in a reliable message, you could just 
forbid sending media before receipt has been confirmed.  When the 
transport is unreliable, the situation is a little less clear, but I 
think there's still possibilities for standardization, e.g., by 
forbidding answerers to send media until they've received media.  This 
is discussed in more length in the document.

Hi Richard,

Forcing media cut-through to occur only after an Answer has been
received
does solve SOME of the early media problems. As others have mentioned,
there
are environments that operate like this already. I also know many
products that
do not cut-through media before the answer is received.

But there are other problems related with early media. Brian Stucker's
draft
listed a bunch of them.=20

Forking for example comes to mind: even if we did mandate cut-through
after
answer, we would still have problems related with forking (i.e., how to
pick
the stream that needs to be played, and how to correlate the stream with
the=20
signaling). How to deal with SRTP key exchange in that scenario is an
even=20
bigger problem.=20

Clipping is a possible side-effect of your proposal. We'd need some
mechanism to=20
mitigate it, in particular for auto-answer scenarios.

   Can someone send me OPTIONS, PUBLISH call flow or redirect me to
   the links where I can find those.

OPTIONS is discussed fairly thoroughly in section 11 of RFC 3261.
PUBLISH is described in RFC 3903.

Would there be any benefit in mentioning why it is specified that (with the
exception of the last hop) a SIPS request must be forwarded over TLS rather
than IPSEC? I can't find anything in RFC 3261. I don't have enough expertise
in this area to propose particular words, but IPSEC seems to be getting
deployed quite a lot (e.g., with IMS) and an IETF opinion on its
appropriateness for transporting SIPS requests might be useful.

> 
> - When a request is rejected, a 403 Forbidden is used instead of 416
> "Unrecognized
>   URI scheme". The rationale is that RFC 3261 says that when you get a
> 416, you
>   should retry with SIP URI scheme which would then loop. If anybody

Hi John,

I think the short answer is that SIPS by definition means TLS. Just like
HTTPS by=20
definition means TLS.

It's not a judgment of the value of TLS versus IPsec. It's just the
definition
of the term.

So if one wants to use IPsec, there is no SIPS to worry about (which
makes
implementation easier on that front).=20

If the group believes that I should mention something about it, I'll
gladly=20
add some wording about it in the spec.

Francois,

Yes, I know that RFC 3261 states that SIPS means TLS, but do we need to
document the reasons for that?

That has worked well so far when TLS was only used over TCP
for SIP (in HTTP, TCP is the only transport, so HTTPS auto-
magically implies TLS over TCP.)

I think what will probably cause a logjam is when TLS is used
with other transports (UDP and SCTP.)  Then, the preference of
a TLS transport can be specified in the URI using the "transport"
parameter with the sips scheme.

Alternatively, DNS NAPTR could be used as well.

I do not know to what extent, if any, we need to specify this
in draft-ietf-sips-01.

Thanks,

- vijay

For what it's worth: TLS over SCTP is already defined, and there is a
Via field
for that. Not so for DTLS.=20

Francois,

I think I have some responses, but I'd like to ask you first: What do 
you mean by "media cut-through"?

Thanks,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies
	Author(s)	: V. Hilt, et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-01.txt
	Pages		: 30
	Date		: 2007-2-13
	
Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call
   routing, rendezvous, and other call features.  This document
   specifies a framework for SIP session policies that provides a
   standard mechanism by which a proxy can define or influence policies
   on sessions, such as the codecs or media types to be used.  It
   defines a model, an overall architecture and new protocol mechanisms
   for session policies.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

This document defines an extension to the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) to convey geographic location information from one 
   SIP entity to another SIP entity.  The extension covers end to end 
   conveyance as well as location-based routing, where proxy servers 
   make routing decisions based on the location of the UAC.

SIP WG

We've submitted the -07 version of the Location Conveyance document based 
on comments from Shida Shubert and Matt Lepinski, some of which were very 
good, and well appreciated.  Most (all?) were either nits or asking for 
clarifications/rewrites of a few individual sentences that didn't seem to 
make sense as written.

We think this document is now done and have asked the chairs for WGLC on it.

Comments are appreciated

James & Brian

If the famous people of Britain act this way knowing the outside world watches everything they do, I can't imagine how ordinary Asian people get treated by white Brits.

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

I have just come against a call centre application that requires a REFER 
to multiple destinations.  In my investigations, it appears that 
draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-01.txt meets what I require from the message.

After reading the draft, however, I am a little disappointed that it 
does not use a SIP header to specify the destinations but instead an XML 
body.  This seems to me to go a little against the grain - why do we 
need another format to specify a call control mechanism?  Surely the 
current SIP syntax can handle it!

The addition of XML means that implementations that wish to use REFER in 
this way, and previously contained purely a SIP stack, now require an 
XML parser with the implications for performance etc.  This also makes 
this request more difficult to implement on resource limited devices.

Are there any alternatives in discussion?
A Refer-To header with multiple values seems more appropriate to me; and 
if this violates the REFER specification, perhaps add a Refer-Cc header?

Thanks for the clarification.  I know that choosing media streams to 
render is a big problem, but it's one I'm viewing as beyond the scope of 
what our draft is explicitly trying to address.

That said, I think that ensuring that media are preceded by an SDP 
answer is a big step in enabling better management of media streams, 
since it gives the offeror (media recipient) SDP metadata on which to 
base its decision.  Once an SDP answer is guaranteed to come before 
media, the issue can be treated more at the SDP layer (e.g. by giving 
SDP sufficient expressiveness to support decisions between media 
streams), rather than at the SIP layer.

With respect to forking in particular: You're correct that even if all 
streams from forked endpoints are preceded by SDP answers, the UAC still 
has to figure out how to deal with them.  But I think that once you 
ensure that the offer/answer finishes before media flows, SRTP keying 
gets a lot simpler, since the UAC can just do a DH exchange through your 
favorite SDP mechanism with each endpoint.

Clipping is certainly something that could be an issue, but I think it 
can be prevented.  The solution I think will work in the end is that an 
SDP answer will be sent immediately by the UAS on receipt of the INVITE, 
before any other action is taken (e.g., before the INVITE is passed to 
the TU).  For example, a PSTN gateway receiving a SIP INVITE would 
return its answer before it initiates the outbound PSTN call.  It seems 
to me like the negotion of an SDP association should precede SIP session 
establishment just like TCP negotiation would precede initiation of a 
higher-layer protocol session.

Does that make sense?

Fair enough. However, I do agree with Francois that forking is one of
the biggest issue.

I agree.

>rather than at the SIP layer.

Due to different paths for signalling and media, it may be difficult to
guarantee that the SDP answer reaches the UAC. But, of course, the
sooner the SDP can be sent before the media, the bigger the chance is.

>With respect to forking in particular: You're correct that=20

That may not always be feasible/possible, but of course it can be used
as an example.=20

I am not sure we need to go so much into details. I think the most
important thing is to try to provide the SDP answer as soon as possible
before the media is sent - or at latest at the same thing when the media
is sent.

For audio I guess a short clipping may not always be a big issue. But,
for video it may be, because if the initial packages are lost it may
take a relatively long time before the UAC is able to create a correct
picture.

Or the other way around, like H.323 and H.245 ;)

May consider rewording like

the message."
or ".. is determined by the location of the UAC which may be present as
by-vlaue or by-reference."
etc.

SIP WG

We've submitted the -07 version of the Location Conveyance document
based on comments from Shida Shubert and Matt Lepinski, some of which
were very good, and well appreciated.  Most (all?) were either nits or
asking for clarifications/rewrites of a few individual sentences that
didn't seem to make sense as written.

We think this document is now done and have asked the chairs for WGLC on
it.

Comments are appreciated

Hi Neil:

The decision of using an XML document to convey the list of recipients 
was taking long time ago. At that time, we wanted to re-use as much as 
possible existing available building blocks, and XML documents for 
URI-lists were already there. Especially, the first method that was 
adopted to use a URI-list was INVITE, and there is no Refer-To header in 
an INVITE request, so the Refer-To wasn't an option. Additionally, we 
can reuse the same list format for other non-REFER URI-list methods, 
such as MESSAGE, INVITE, and SUBSCRIBE. These methods do not contain a 
Refer-To header, as I said.

Using XML URI-lists has other advantages, such as the possibility to add 
attributes, for example to qualify a recipient as a copied (similar to 
e-mail cc:).

The kind of lists that we are managing are fairly simple, so you don't 
really need to build a general XML parser, if you don't want to do it, 
but in any case, there are a few open source XML parsers out there. 
Whether we like it or not, XML is more and more present in our SIPpish 
lifes.

/Miguel

Hi James,

I have never seen the comments from Shida and Matt for this document. 
Are you referring to some older discussions?

Hannes

Shida's, I just noticed, was only to the authors, and was Dec 12th, 
06 - and his review was for -05 the day I submitted -06, which 
covered most of what he wanted changed (showing good minds think 
alike, perhaps?).

Matt's was Jan 4th, 07 to the SIP list

so these are not so old...

James

That's why we report it as "a consensus in the meeting" rather than  
"a consensus". My default assumption is that strong consensus in a  
meeting is likely to represent rough list consensus. When there is  
doubt (raised by a participant, or on a hunch of a Chair), we need to  
ask the list.

That's why I polled. And I'm still digesting the results of that  
poll. I feel something like an anaconda that accidentally ate a full- 
grown water buffalo instead of a small pig -- that is, it's hard to  
digest the results, and I'm not sure what to do about the horns.

My personal belief is that this keepalive question is comingled with  
the UDP and large packet issue. If we fix the congestion-explosion  
problem of SIP large messages (it's not a reliability thing, it is a  
Breaks The Internet thing) by effectively deprecating UDP, then we  
don't really need most of STUN. If that's the direction, or might  
become the direction, then we probably shouldn't require STUN for  
TCP. But if we're going to keep a dual-protocol model forever (as  
Marc has argued for extending to where we can use UDP to kick-start  
TCP), then we might as well use STUN in both cases.

Some people (Frank? Juha? Me??) clearly believe that outbound is  
where we can draw the dividing line between a dual-protocol past and  
a TCP future.

Some (Cullen? Sean?) believe that we can't draw a dividing line using  
Outbound, but that we'll eventually cross that line.

Others (Marc) believe we cannot even approach such a transition at  
this time and that we need to heavily revise outbound to account for  
the perceived limitations of both TCP and UDP.

So, what do you people believe?

1) Do you believe that UDP transport of large messages will aggravate  
the congestion impact of SIP on the Internet (I personally do, just  
so you know my bias).

2) Will UDP fade away from SIP relatively soon?

3) If UDP will fade away, do we need to burden TCP-only  
implementations with a more complex keepalive protocol designed  
originally for UDP?

4) If UDP will fade away, do we need to account for UDP at all in  
outbound?

5) If UDP will NOT fade away relatively soon, and TCP will not scale  
relatively soon, then do you believe that we need a transition  
mechanism so that we can register and keepalive using UDP, then bring  
up short-lived TCP connections for large messages as Marc's draft  
proposes?

6) If you agree with #1 but think UDP will not fade away and don't  
see the need for #5, then I either want to know what sort of  
alternative you envision, because we're going to need one.

Hi,

I was hoping to use building blocks too - since we already have and 
implementation that will turn a Refer-To (or whatever header) into an 
INVITE (or other) request it would have been very easy to extend this to 
act on multiple values. According to this draft, however, we must now 
support two different ways of specifying a destination.  While it is no 
great deal to add an XML parser to resource rich devices (e.g. a PC) it 
can have a significant impact on resource limited/restricted devices.

>From your response, I am not sure that I understand how XML documents 
for URI lists can be used for non-REFER methods.  You mention its use 
for the INVITE and MESSAGE methods - surely these already have bodies 
(i.e. SDP and the message).
What is wrong with re-using the method used by, for example, a '300 
Multiple Choices' response which specifies a list of URIs in Contact 
headers?
You also mention the ability to add attributes as an advantage of XML - 
this does also exists within the SIP format in the form of parameters.  
Is this not sufficient?

Normally when looking at a protocol I would expect the request for 
multiple elements to be an extension of the request for one element.
>From a reverse engineering case, after seeing a REFER message with an 
XML body containing a list URIs I would expect the case for a REFER with 
one element to be the same except there would only be one element in the 
XML body.  This is not the case (although it would probably work on 
devices that accept this extension).

I was expecting something simpler, along the lines of a SIP extension 
that implied multiple Refer-To headers are allowed in a REFER message.

Personally I think that XML is a bit of a bandwagon that gets used as a 
'solution for everyone' format (bit like ADA ;)).  It has its place for 
structured data, documents and so on; but I don't think it should be 
mixed with other protocols in this way.  I think that SIP should be used 
for the communications and getting the data to the right place and the 
XML should be left for document exchange, user directories, etc.

Neil Hampton.

2) Will UDP fade away from SIP relatively soon?

FM: It will only fade quickly if its deprecated.  There is so much
implementation out there that makes use of UDP that will not go away
unless its forced to go away and deprecation will force that.

deprecate UDP in outbound.  I'm just not sure that any of the solutions
that are in outbound are going to be universal enough to solve the
problem.  Where does that leave us?  I guess I think that outbound
should basically sketch potential solutions to the problem for UDP,
publish it then quickly deprecate the whole thing by doing 3.0 with TCP
only.



5) If UDP will NOT fade away relatively soon, and TCP will not scale

FM: If it were up to me (which thankfully its not), I would publish
outbound essentially unchanged as a BCP, the immediately begin work on
3.0.  I think 3.0 should scour 3261 under the assumption that we are TCP
only as its basic design tenet.

The question is not "do we deprecate UDP in outbound".=20

The question is do we define procedures for UDP and TCP in outbound. Or
just TCP.

You could still do UDP, but it may not work with outbound (if we choose
not
to support it).

There is no need to wait for a SIP 3.0 for that.

Dean,

Why doesn't the device just detect if it's behind a NAT, using STUN or
whatever.

If it determines that it is behind a NAT, then it uses TCP and outbound.

The device is free to use UDP when not behind a NAT.=20

PS: missing from your whole analysis is the fact that if you want to use
a secure
transport, then TLS/TCP or TLS/SCTP it is. Considering that we should
encourage
secure implementations, I find this obsession with optimizing our design
for the
non-secure transport rather bizarre.

We closed this last time by pointing out there is a draft and working  
implementations that do SIP over DTLS. The security issues is not at  
all coupled with the UDP/TCP issue.

Good to see we are going to get to repeat all this conversation.

Hey

Thanks for the review. Please see my comments in-line

I reworded the first part of the second paragraph to:

"Geographic location in the IETF is discussed in RFC 3693 (Geopriv 
Requirements) [RFC3693]. It defines a "target" as the entity whose 
location is being sought. In this case, this is the user agent's (UA) 
location. "

Here, I am reading that you want the text to change from a case in 
which location is in the message, to one in which location *may* be 
in the message. While I agree completely that location can only be a 
MAY in general, for location based routing (the subject of this part 
of the text, we should indicate that location is present in order to 
perform this location based routing.  Do you agree?

Here, I am not sure I understand your question.  RFC 3261 does not 
allow SIP Proxies from inserting message bodies, so even if the proxy 
knows where the UAC is, it cannot insert this location information 
by-value.  The terminology "Location Server" in Geopriv is the IP 
entity that builds the PIDF-LO and is first to transmit it.  Since 
proxies cannot insert location by-value, proxies cannot be Location 
Servers. UACs can be location servers, and B2BUAs can be location servers.

Within all this, you mention the location server "may not be globally 
accessible". This tells me you are actually referring to the server 
where the location-by-reference URI points to (i.e. where the UAC's 
PIDF-LO is - waiting to be accessed - which is called 
dereferencing).  This is not a "Location Server" in Geopriv, and RFC 
3693 defines this.

This document already states the dereference server needs to be 
accessible if location is conveyed by-reference, otherwise location 
is not conveyed (which is the point of this extension).

are you taking issue with the word "indicative"? If so, how about me 
changing this to "... indicating which entity..."

fair -- how about I take "within the network" out of the sentence?

I think this is outside the scope of this doc. This topic should be 
asked in ECRIT, as they have 2 docs defining the devices BCP and the 
Emergency calling Framework. Hopefully there will be an emergency 
services network in front of the IP enabled PSAP to route the call to 
a PSAP that can understand this extension.

That said, I believe what will happen is most (if not all?) IP based 
PSAPs understand this extension from the beginning.  NENA  and EMTEL 
are telling all PSAPs in North America and the EU to do this. Several 
other areas of the world are being told to do this also.  Of course 
we cannot be assured every IP enabled PSAP in the world will, but 
it's likely to be based on something from the IETF, the ITU-T, 3GPP 
or one of the other SDOs that attended last year's Emergency SDO 
conference that agreed to this general mechanism to convey location 
to a PSAP from a SIP phone.

I agree with Francois here.

Providing outbound for TCP, and not for UDP, might be the incentive that 
some need to move to TCP.

The problem is, as pointed out several times here, that you can't ever
*reliably* detect being behind a middlebox that breaks UDP. NATs are
only one type of such a box, firewalls generally are much worse because
you can't detect them simply by making a STUN binding request.

That said, this is a problem that only affects the UDP-only
implementations. The TCP-only implementations have a provable just-works
scheme to get around these problems.

Aki

Yes.

Yes.

Definitely not.

No, but I'm fine with text that Rohan proposed for outbound many moons
ago, basically saying that you can insist on using UDP, but all bets are
off as to whether or not it will actually work in the Internet.

Iff I thought those assumptions were actually reasonable (which I don't)
I'd probably say yes. But since I don't, I don't.

See answer for #4.

UDP will not fade away, but TCP-only implementations should use CRLF.
UDP+TCP implementations (there is no such thing as a SIP UDP-only
implementation) should support STUN and CRLF for TCP.

UDP will not fade away.

I think that the solution is to use session resumption (and eventually
RFC 4507) between DTLS and TLS to reduce the cost of establishment.

I will add this to the next version the draft.

>(there is no such thing as a SIP UDP-only implementation)

What information do you base that statement upon?

I thought you talked about IMPLEMENTATIONS - not what the RFC says :)

Hey

Thanks for the review. Please see my comments in-line

I reworded the first part of the second paragraph to:

"Geographic location in the IETF is discussed in RFC 3693 (Geopriv
Requirements) [RFC3693]. It defines a "target" as the entity whose
location is being sought. In this case, this is the user agent's (UA)
location. "

---
US:

I am afraid it still seems to mean the same.=20

This-->target-->UA's location
I mean This-->target-->UA

UA's Location would be represented as PID-LO.

Otherwise in the reworded para:

If you say something like "In this case, this is the user agent whose
location is desired" etc. then UA becomes the entity.

Here, I am reading that you want the text to change from a case in which
location is in the message, to one in which location *may* be in the
message. While I agree completely that location can only be a MAY in
general, for location based routing (the subject of this part of the
text, we should indicate that location is present in order to perform
this location based routing.  Do you agree?

---
US:=20

agreed here(MAY part).
Additionally, I wanted the sentence to be re-formatted for a better
placing of the "by-value or by-reference" part, but that is non-issue.

Here, I am not sure I understand your question.  RFC 3261 does not allow
SIP Proxies from inserting message bodies, so even if the proxy knows
where the UAC is, it cannot insert this location information by-value.
The terminology "Location Server" in Geopriv is the IP entity that
builds the PIDF-LO and is first to transmit it.  Since proxies cannot
insert location by-value, proxies cannot be Location Servers. UACs can
be location servers, and B2BUAs can be location servers.

----
US: That would be the Location Generators (entities that build PIDF-LO),
Location Servers would receive these PIDF-LO from the LGs (RFC3693)
and/or receive subscriptions from LRs.
----

Within all this, you mention the location server "may not be globally
accessible". This tells me you are actually referring to the server
where the location-by-reference URI points to (i.e. where the UAC's
PIDF-LO is - waiting to be accessed - which is called dereferencing).
This is not a "Location Server" in Geopriv, and RFC
3693 defines this.

-----
US:=20

But here I think this(the server) would correspond to an entity like
Presence Agent that would respond to dereferencing SUBSCRIBE requests
with NOTIFY's but this is one of the function of a Location Server
[RFC2693].=20

----

This document already states the dereference server needs to be
accessible if location is conveyed by-reference, otherwise location is
not conveyed (which is the point of this extension).

----

are you taking issue with the word "indicative"? If so, how about me
changing this to "... indicating which entity..."

fair -- how about I take "within the network" out of the sentence?

I think this is outside the scope of this doc. This topic should be
asked in ECRIT, as they have 2 docs defining the devices BCP and the
Emergency calling Framework. Hopefully there will be an emergency
services network in front of the IP enabled PSAP to route the call to a
PSAP that can understand this extension.

That said, I believe what will happen is most (if not all?) IP based
PSAPs understand this extension from the beginning.  NENA  and EMTEL are
telling all PSAPs in North America and the EU to do this. Several other
areas of the world are being told to do this also.  Of course we cannot
be assured every IP enabled PSAP in the world will, but it's likely to
be based on something from the IETF, the ITU-T, 3GPP or one of the other
SDOs that attended last year's Emergency SDO conference that agreed to
this general mechanism to convey location to a PSAP from a SIP phone.

---
US:

Ok,  but is this contradicting the statement in Section 5.2 which says
"...A Require header with the geolocation option tag indicates the UAC
is requiring the UAS understand this extension or else send an error
response."=20

as opposed to 3.5  "...Appearance of the option tag in the Require
header is a request for location to be conveyed."

I've seen FWs that kill TCP connection after 10 minutes.

This message is a result of some offline discussions with Rob and ample
caffeine consumption on my part.  The concern is if PRACK is necessary in
order to use connected-identity before the call is answered in order to
avoid some of the attacks Robin brought up on RTPSEC.


Reading RFC3311 (SIP UPDATE), it says:

      o  If the UPDATE is being sent before completion of the initial
         INVITE transaction, and the initial INVITE contained an offer,
         the UPDATE can contain an offer if the callee generated an
         answer in a reliable provisional response, and the caller has
         received answers to any other offers it sent in either PRACK or
         UPDATE, and has generated answers for any offers it received in
         an UPDATE from the callee.

draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity seems to say you need to use PRACK if you
want connected-identity before the 200 Ok:

   After an early dialog has been formed, if the "from-change" option
   tag has been received in a Supported header field the UA MAY issue an
   UPDATE request (RFC 3311 [4]) on the same dialog, subject to having
   sent a reliable provisional response to the INVITE request and having
   received and responded to a PRACK request. 

Which I interpret to mean that the following is illegal, even if the SDP in
message 2 and 3 are identical:  

    Alice                      Bob
      |                         |
  1.  |--Invite with SDP offer->|
  2.  |<--183 with SDP answer---|  (183 is unreliable)
  3.  |<--UPDATE with SDP-------|
  4.  |---Ack Update----------->|

Please confirm that the above call flow is disallowed per the rules of
RFC3311 and per the rules of draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity.


Question:  would ICE's "poor-man's PRACK" (as I call it) be sufficient to
meet the needs of RFC3311 and -sip-connected-identity for a reliable
provisional response?  ICE's "poor-man's PRACK" is described in
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-13#section-12.1>, around
the middle of section 12.1.

Mostly works for me, but there are stateful firewall cases that won't be 
detected by STUN or whatever that would benefit from using outbound.

So my guidance is that if you support outbound and you're a UA 
registering with a proxy, USE OUTBOUND.

DTLS. It has TLS security properties, but about the same large-datagram 
story as UDP.

Hi,
       Is there a standard format of SIP message showing how "User specific dictionary" can be uploaded in the initial SIP message ?
       I basically wanted to know how the compressor uploads this in the sigcom message, and how the decompressor identifies/interprets this dictionary . I really appreciate if any of you guys can help me in understanding this with your suggestions.
   
  Thanks,
  Ramesh

Subject: [Sip] Followup: Pool on Update of outbound (retitled thread)

<Snip>


Some people (Frank? Juha? Me??) clearly believe that outbound is where
we can draw the dividing line between a dual-protocol past and a TCP
future.

Some (Cullen? Sean?) believe that we can't draw a dividing line using
Outbound, but that we'll eventually cross that line.

Others (Marc) believe we cannot even approach such a transition at this
time and that we need to heavily revise outbound to account for the
perceived limitations of both TCP and UDP.

So, what do you people believe?

1) Do you believe that UDP transport of large messages will aggravate
the congestion impact of SIP on the Internet (I personally do, just so
you know my bias).

JR - Yes

2) Will UDP fade away from SIP relatively soon?

JR - I'm seeing no sign of this in the market. =20

3) If UDP will fade away, do we need to burden TCP-only implementations
with a more complex keepalive protocol designed originally for UDP?

JR - No

4) If UDP will fade away, do we need to account for UDP at all in
outbound?

JR - UDP will not fade away anytime soon, given the huge install base. =20

5) If UDP will NOT fade away relatively soon, and TCP will not scale
relatively soon, then do you believe that we need a trans7bit

Hi,

When people indicate whether they believe/don't believe UDP will fade
away, I think it would be very important - especially if we in the most
extreme case are going to throw away UDP from SIP completely - that
people indicate WHY they think so.

At the UDP-will-not-fade-away camp I have seen one reply where "MARKET
SITUATION" is mentioned, and Dean indicated that his sponsor has shipped
large number of non-TCP implementations. Important input, I think.

For those who DO think that UDP will go away - what is that belief based
on? Market/deployment situation, theoretical problems that may occur, or
simply wishful thinking? :)

Someone also mentioned that, by defining SIP 3.0 and removing UDP,
people will be "forced" to switch from UDP to TCP. I don't think it
works exactly like that...

Regards,

Christer

Dan,

The important thing is that there be evidence that the 18x has reached the
calling UA before sending an UPDATE request to the calling UA. Otherwise the
UPDATE request might receive a 481 response. So I suppose the called UA
could send an UPDATE request and be prepared to repeat it (and the 18x
response) if a 481 response is received. This would be another example of
"poor man's PRACK". A problem could arise if the calling UA holds state to
say whether a 18x has been received reliably and rejects an UPDATE request
if not - I guess this depends on how it is implemented in practice. Also a
calling UA that does not implement PRACK might also be unable to accept
UPDATE before answer, but the option tag that indicates support for UPDATE
will not tell you this.

Another issue is whether the presence or absence of SDP offer in an UPDATE
request has impact on when it can/cannot be sent. If it contains an SDP
offer, obviously it has to obey the strict offer-answer rules, so clearly
has to be sent after any previous offer-answer sequence has completed.
Without waiting for the PRACK it could be dangerous. Consider the following
slightly revised sequence:

    Alice                      Bob
      |                         |
  1.  |--Invite with SDP offer->|
  1a  |<--18x without SDP answer|
  2.  |x--183 with SDP answer---|  (183 is unreliable)
  3.  |<--UPDATE with SDP-------|
  4.  |---Ack Update----------->|

The first 18x is send unreliably and established the early dialog. The
second 183 containing SDP answer is lost. The UPDATE request will not
receive a 481 response (because the early dialog is already established) but
the SDP offer will be illegal. It is unclear what response Alice would give.
So in this particular case it is a lot safer to wait for the PRACK.
Therefore I think the 

However, if the UPDATE request does NOT contain an SDP offer (which for
connected-identity purposes it doesn't need to), the following are
questionable:
- the need to wait for PRACK if the 18x is sent reliably;
- the need to send the 18x reliably
- the whether the UPDATE request can be sent even if the only 18x sent does
not contain SDP answer;
- whether an UPDATE request containing an offer for early session
disposition can be sent before the normal answer has been sent or before it
has been acknowledged through PRACK.

I don't think these points are covered by RFC3311.

Will hear the storm-blast of his clarion.
Rise, to the muffled chime of churchbell choir.
But when, on the timepieces that we call
XVI. Laying a Ghost: The Jeannette and the Fram
to matter, for the flushed boys are muscular
A salamander scuttles across the quiet
And he is swathed in ever-petrified dread;
I seek, above all, in the wandering
Left and right, and far ahead in the dusk.
Of tree-dividing sky finally comes down to
visitors' dugout. The osprey whose nest is atop
Across the heavens' gray.
shortcake, waffles, berries and cream
Of tree-dividing sky finally comes down to
That rings, with faithful tongue, its pious note
What? What can you do?
In the woods, close by,
XXI. Flying in the Arctic
Beneath the snowflakes I notice fa?des

There's a nit in draft-ietf-sip-gruu-11.txt:  In Appendix A, it reads:

   When the first contact with a specific instance ID is registered, the
   proxy generates a fresh initialization vector (IV) I. It also notes
   the wallclock time (W) and stores this as part of the registration.
   When the registrar wishes to create a new temporary GRUU, it
   computes:

    EA = E(K_e, AOR || " " || instance_ID || W || T1 || T2 || .. || Tn)

   using initialization vector I where || indicates concatenation, and
   T1, T2, and so on represent the current expiration times (measured in

But the "initialization vector I" does not appear in the computation
of EA.  I suspect something is missing from the concatenation that is
the second argument of E().

To detect the attacks that Rob brought up on the RTPSEC mailing list,
we would want the UPDATE to contain the same SDP as it has in the
18x (183).

That's my point:  it does need to contain SDP in order to protect
against the very same attacks that Identity protected against:  
if the SDP isn't included, the Connected-Identity isn't useful
because anybody could send RTP to the calling party.  That RTP
could be audio saying "your mother wears combat boots".  Because
the SDP isn't signed, there isn't any assurance it's coming from
the expected IP addresses, nor can we use a=fingerprint to create
cryptographic assurance.

Yes, we need this standardized somewhere.

Can you repost those that did not appear on the SIP list to the SIP

It's not missing. The text says "using initialization vector I".
AFAICT common practice is not to have the IV be an explicit argument
when you represent encryption.

Note that this is posted with my "chair hat" firmly in place.

At IETF 67, the sense of the room was that we should use STUN as a  
keepalive mechanism for Outbound in both TCP and UDP scenarios.

Since then, we've had a whole lot of list discussion. Not everybody  
has weighed in, but I think we've mostly changed our minds. I changed  
mine, anyhow.

Here's what I've concluded from the polls and list discussion:

We generally agree that we need to make a decision and move outbound  
forward. I don't think anybody disagrees here.

We are undecided about the future of the UDP vs TCP debate, and  
generally don't think we can usefully conclude anything about that in  
the context of the Outbound draft. Some of us would like to, but the  
general sense is that we should not hold up Outbound in trying to do  
so. We should continue to have that discussion, but not in the  
context of Outbound.

I believe that the current rough consensus is to keep Outbound pretty  
much as it currently is, but to change the keepalive mechanism for  
TCP connections. Most of the folks seem to believe that CRLF is  
entirely adequate for keepalive over TCP, and that in environments  
where it is supported, TCP-level keepalive (SO_KEEPALIVE) is also  
adequate. The general rule would seem to be "If you can do  
SO_KEEPALIVE with a timer less than 10 minutes, use it, and if not,  
then use the CRLF technique."

So I would like to know: Who, if anybody, strongly disagrees with the  
preceding approach? If you DISAGREE, please post to that effect, and  
explain what you think the problem is and why we should stay with the  
IETF-67 agreement to use STUN for both TCP and UDP.

This is getting time-critical (author needs to make changes before  
cut-off), so I'll expect any dissenting positions to be raised on- 
list by the end of the week, Feb. 23.

Thanks!

ah, but having the option tag means "do not error (424) this message 
expecting location to be included", it says the UAC understands the 
SIP extension. A UAS can then attempt to SUB to the original UAC (now 
the UAS of the SUB) and see if it can pull location from the UA. The 
event package will have to be specified, which it isn't.

if something were created to be added by the UAC to indicate it 
doesn't no have its location, yet understands the geolocation SIP 
extension, this would have to be removed by the SIP proxy (which is 
dangerous) that inserts the UAC's location into the message. That's 
why we are more or less implying something here, instead of being explicit.

actually, adding a second geolocation uri is fine, as long as the 
existing uris themselves in the geolocation header are not deleted, 
or modified. This, I hope is clear from section 5.3.1.

I will change the text (below) to state "...MUST NOT modify any 
existing URI in the Geolocation header..." to be clear that a new uri 
can be added, but the one(s) there cannot be modified or deleted.

Thanks

James

Hi,
=20
I have a question on RFC 3325 in regard to handling of SIP requests for
the following e.g:-
1) Having malformed syntax for PAI or PPI header? Should UA send 400 Bad
Request or ignore it.
=20
   Text from rfc " A P-Asserted-Identity header field value MUST consist
of exactly one
   name-addr or addr-spec".
=20
2) Having more then 2 PAI or PPI headers? Should UA send 400 Bad Request
or ignore it.
    Having 2 PAI, both with sip URI?. Should UA send 400 Bad Request or
ignore it.
    Having 2 PAI, both with sips URI?. Should UA send 400 Bad Request or
ignore it.
    Having 2 PAI, both with tel URI?. Should UA send 400 Bad Request or
ignore it.
    Having 2 PAI, one with sip URI and other with tel URI. The sip URI
is having correct syntax and tel URI having bad syntax?. Should UA send
400 Bad Request or ignore it.
  =20
   Text from rfc " There may be one or two P-Asserted-Identity
   values.  If there is one value, it MUST be a sip, sips, or tel URI.
   If there are two values, one value MUST be a sip or sips URI and the
   other MUST be a tel URI."
=20

Thanks,
Rajeev

this reminds me, how does one make a secure call using a tel uri,
because there is no tels?  if it cannot be done, it is yet another good
reason to deprecate sips or tel or preferable both.

I don't think it is the fact that his sponsor has shipped large numbers
of terminals is the issue. The very fact that outbound uses option-tags
with a Require header means that a terminal that has not been upgraded
is not going to work in outbound - it will default to not using it. To
use outbound, existing terminals have to be upgraded.

I do accept that the cost of maintaining the future market may be
impacted, but that is not the same thing.

Hi Ranjit,

Every MESSAGE method will be acknowledged by 200 OK success response.

That means,=20

If "A" sends MESSAGE to "B", upon receiving this MESSAGE B sends 200 OK
response to A.

Hi Ranjit,

Every MESSAGE method will be acknowledged by 200 OK success response.

=20

That means,=20

If "A" sends MESSAGE to "B", upon receiving this MESSAGE B sends 200 OK
response to A.

=20

Dan,

I can see the benefit of doing a further SDP offer in an UPDATE request that
coveys connected-identity to prove that the security keys and other SDP
information do indeed come from the user identified in the From header
field. However, I seem to be missing the link to Rob's original question,
which was how to ensure that it comes from an entity that received the
INVITE request (and hence ensure that the SRTP comes from such an entity).

John

Both of you are on Mars.  This thread is about outbound.  The number of
implementations that will implement outbound using SIP over DTLS or over
SIP over TLS/SCTP is miniscule.  Anybody who implemented SIP over either
transport would have no problem doing SIP over TLS/TCP and by extension
SIP over TCP.

This issue is about burdening future TCP (and TLS over TCP)
implementations that do outbound with STUN keepalives or not.

thanks,
-rohan

Ok.  And if the offerer is being paranoid, the connected-identity
would need to arrive before the called party's phone rings (in order
to avoid clipping).  We'll need to work on ways to indicate that;
perhaps PRACK is perfect for this, but as we know it isn't widely
implement due to both its complexity and the IPR arround it.

IMO, that is resolved by the fact the offerer received an UPDATE
containing an Identity signature.  This is because sip-identity 
(and, hence, connected-identity) presume the network between the 
SIP UA and the authentication service are sufficiently secure 
against the threats on that network.  TLS is the simplest example,
but SIP Digest authentication with its integrity protection is 
sufficient for that threat.

Dan,

I'm missing something here. I see nothing to prevent using UPDATE 
(without SDP) for conveying connected identity before the 200. Then the 
offer/answer can carry on as normal without PRACK.

Regarding the validity/non-validity of the call flow below, see 
draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer-00.

I didn't see this response when I sent my prior one. And John covers all 
I did and more.

One pragmatic question I have is: does anybody implement UPDATE without 
also implementing PRACK? While it is technically legal to do so, in 
practice they are typically used together. I'd be very surprised to see 
support of one without the other?

(Robert: do you have any statistics from SIPIT?)

But maybe the issue isn't whether PRACK has been implemented, but rather 
whether there is a desire to use it. It increases the number of messages 
used for a typical call, so maybe some will prefer to omit it for that 
reason.

But we need the SDP signed.

1. Without SRTP:  The SDP answer needs to be signed for all the
   reasons the body (SDP offer) was signed in SIP-Identity.
   Otherwise, an attacker could send an SDP answer containing his own
   IP address, and the offerer would believe it.  This allows the
   attacker to play media to the calling party, and the calling party
   has no way to defend against such an attacker because there was
   never any signed SDP.

2. With crypto:  When we have cryptographic mechanisms to associate
   the signaling with the media path (such as with comedia-tls
   [RFC4572] and DTLS-SRTP), the problem is more acute, because it's a
   full-on requirement that an attacker be unable to inject malicious
   media into the path.  If we can't get the a=fingerprint signed
   using SIP-Identity, we cannot prevent that attack.

I understand everyone is happy with the state of (1), which is what
connected-identity permits today.  That's fine.  The reason I started
this thread was to clarify that we can, in the near future, extend the
protections we can get with Connected-Identity to protect us from
attackers when we are doing (2).

Thanks for the pointer.  Its section 3.1 says:

   Therefore, to make implementations simple, a
   UA acting as a UAS for INVITE transaction is recommended not to send
   a UPDATE request with an offer until the reliable response with an
   answer to the offer in the INVITE request is acknowledged with PRACK
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
   request.
   ^^^^^^^

Here, too, I would wonder aloud if ICE's "poor man's PRACK" is 
sufficient to meet the needs of the highlighted phrase.

Hi,

    In case the PAI/PPI header is malformed the request should be 
rejected with a 400 Bad Request header. In cases, where the previous hop 
is from a trusted domain the PAI takes precedence over the From header 
and should be used as the callers identity. A PPI header is generally of 
no importance to the endpoint and is used by the privacy server for 
choosing the appropriate identity to be inserted into the outgoing message.
     Similiarly, in the scenario mentioned above the request should be 
rejected with a 4xx response.
Regards
Nisha

I've updated an Internet-Draft giving condensed instructions for UA
implementors on how to implement GRUU support.  (This is updated for
version -11 of the GRUU I-D, but it only discusses "public GRUUs",
which is what we need for our environment.)  In our product's
environment (a "true SIP", proxy-based PBX), we've found that to do
call control well, the UAs need to implement (public) GRUU.  This I-D
summarizes what UAs need to do

   Guidelines for Implementing the GRUU Support in User Agents
   draft-worley-sip-gruu-implement-02

   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-worley-sip-gruu-implement-02.txt

   Abstract

   Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
   a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used
   by anyone on the Internet to route a request to that specific UA
   instance.  A URI which routes to a specific UA instance is called a
   Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  An Internet-Draft is progressing
   toward standardization that specifies procedures for proxies and UAs
   by which proxies can construct and delver GRUUs to UAs that request
   them.  This document summarizes for UA implementors how to obtain
   "public" GRUUs and gives guidance on effectively using public GRUUs.

Feel free to contact me with any comments.

Hi,

When people indicate whether they believe/don't believe UDP will fade
away, I think it would be very important - especially if we in the most
extreme case are going to throw away UDP from SIP completely - that
people indicate WHY they think so.

At the UDP-will-not-fade-away camp I have seen one reply where "MARKET
SITUATION" is mentioned, and Dean indicated that his sponsor has shipped
large number of non-TCP implementations. Important input, I think.

For those who DO think that UDP will go away - what is that belief based
on? Market/deployment situation, theoretical problems that may occur, or
simply wishful thinking? :)

Someone also mentioned that, by defining SIP 3.0 and removing UDP,
people will be "forced" to switch from UDP to TCP. I don't think it
works exactly like that...

Regards,

Christer

Let me describe my opinion a little differently.  The reason that there
are implementations that use both UDP and TCP is because the standard
allows for it.  Indeed, one of the selling points of SIP early on was
that it was transport independent, i.e. you could pass SIP over any
transport you liked.

UDP was arguably the "first" transport.  What I mean is, most of the
initial work wrt transport was done based on it but always with the idea
that it was not exclusive.  TCP was given less coverage initially but
has become more important recently primarily (from what I've observed)
because it behaves "better" with NATs.  There have always been cursory
discussions about using something like SCTP but as has already been
noted, this transport is a tiny percentage of the overall usage out
there.

So, my point is this, I think that the need for transport independence
is really the heart of the issue here.  I think that a single transport
is fine and that TCP makes the most sense as that single transport.
Here are my reasons:

1) a single transport will improve interoperability
2) TCP as the single transport will traverse NATs more predictably that
UDP (and presumably SCTP although I'm not an expert in SCTP)
3) TCP as the single transport has the potential to simplify the SIP
protocol quite a bit, e.g. all the timer stuff is unnecessary
4) there are few (if any) deployment situations where UDP would work but
TCP would not


So, that said, a comment about the "standard" as a concept.  While I
agree with you that the market will use both for some period of time,
remember that the use of both is there now because the standard allowed
for it.  The standard defines what the implementations need to do.  If
the standard deprecates multiple transports, then the implementations
will follow, they have to otherwise they won't interoperate.

The relatively new draft:

http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sip/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth- 
sol-00.txt


attempts to resolve the requirements raised in:

http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sip/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-02.txt


As solutions drafts go, this one is substantially incomplete (for  
example, the Security section is basically nonexistent). But I think  
the general approach being taken looks reasonable, and that the  
problem being solved is a real problem that needs to be solved. The  
very real issues with digest authentication are pretty well  
understood, and this sort of technique looks like it will provide a  
very useful alternative.

So I'd like to ask the group to take a look at these drafts and start  
thinking about what we, as a working group, need to do in this area.  
We're perhaps not ready to take on new work at this time, but I  
expect we will be before too much longer. Is this a problem we should  
be addressing?

There is _some_ UDP specific timer behavior that you could remove if  
we somehow removed  all possibility of
non-reliable transports from the protocol (*cough*DTLS*cough*).

Not all timer behavior would go away. NITs  (and ACKs) would still  
time out. Proxies would still retain Timer C.
(If altering these behaviors are in the scope of this thread, you're  
_way_ outside the bounds of talking about
  fixing a transport congestion issue).

As of now TLS is the only mechanism available for authentication using
certificate.=20
It would be nice to have a solution where certificate can be utilized
for authentication with authentication service more than one hop away
from UA.

Hi,

the draft addresses certificate based authentication over multiple hops,
were certificate based authentication in TLS does not help. As this may
not only be a problem in SIP scenarios, it would be beneficial to have
such an authentication enhancement within HTTP instead of SIP. As HTTP
digest authentication is currently used in SIP, an enhanced HTTP
authentication utilizing certificates may be used in SIP as well. So
from my point of view the draft sounds interesting, but may have a
broader scope by incorporating it into HTTP directly. The draft already
raises this question in the discussion section.

Ciao

I agree that the approach taken in the document is reasonable and that 
certificate-based authentication over multiple hops is a problem that 
SIP should solve.

However, I disagree with Steffen's suggestion that the work be 
incorporated into HTTP directly. I believe the need for 
certificate-based authentication over multiple hops is a more pressing 
issue for SIP than for HTTP. Therefore, I think we will arrive at a good 
solution sooner if we solve the problem in this working group than if 
first try to solve it first for HTTP and then map the HTTP solution back 
to SIP. (By contrast, in the case of digest authentication, a reasonable 
mechanism already existed within HTTP and therefore it made sense to 
adapt the existing solution to SIP.) If we produce a good multi-hop, 
certificate-based authentication mechanism for SIP and someone believes 
that it is also useful for HTTP, then there's nothing to prevent the SIP 
solution from later being adapted to work with HTTP.

For what it's worth, I think that in the context of the  Outbound draft
UDP should depreciated moving forward. A connection oriented protocol is
clearly the best choice for handling situations like NAT, and removing
the requirement for UDP in outbound would allow for a much simpler
keepalive mechanism. UDP will most likely not go away anytime soon for a
large portion of SIP implementations, and that's fine. In the context of
SIP/3.0 UDP should definitely continue to be supported. One of the
greatest strengths of SIP IS the fact that the implementation is
transport independent. Besides, does anyone on this list really think
that obsoleting UDP in v3 will have any effect on the actual number of
UDP only implementations?? The choice should be left to the designers of
individual implementations as to which transport(s) to support/not
support. I feel that it's more important in v3 to keep the specification
as open as possible and let the market decide which transport(s) best
suit their need, then in outbound draw a line and drop support for UDP.
1) Do you believe that UDP transport of large messages will aggravate
the congestion impact of SIP on the Internet (I personally do, just so
you know my bias).

Yes.

2) Will UDP fade away from SIP relatively soon?

No.

3) If UDP will fade away, do we need to burden TCP-only implementations
with a more complex keepalive protocol designed originally for UDP?

Even though UDP most likely won't fade away from SIP anytime soon
doesn't mean that UDP must be supported in the context of outbound.

4) If UDP will fade away, do we need to account for UDP at all in
outbound?

Same answer as #3 really... even though UDP won't fade away from SIP for
some time we should only use connection oriented transports for
outbound.

5) If UDP will NOT fade away relatively soon, and TCP will not scale
relatively soon, then do you believe that we need a transition mechanism
so that we can register and keepalive using UDP, then bring up
short-lived TCP connections for large messages as Marc's draft proposes?

Nope... remove UDP from outbound all together, and while we're at it
remove the requirement for STUN with TCP and use either TCP keepalives,
CRLFs, or even whitespace for keep-alive.

6) If you agree with #1 but think UDP will not fade away and don't see
the need for #5, then I either want to know what sort of alternative you
envision, because we're going to need one.

Same as #5, connection based transports using either TCP keepalives,
CRLFs, or whitespace.

I think that William has done an excellent job of summarizing the
reality of the situation and what we should do about it.

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006.
The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007
Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the
most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as
Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to
be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with
general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a
number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new
graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and
toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.
Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief
amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for
smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks
before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office
Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for
Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server
architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time
between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a
web page. While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been
removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its
successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

I've been looking through
draft-ietf-sipping-app-interaction-framework-05

=20

Has there been any discussion of application interaction for clients
which do not want to accept an HTTP URI?

=20

I am thinking of light-weight clients who might wish to visually display
information associated with a service (voicemail menu options etc.) but
still send choices as DTMF from the keypad in the conventional way.
Something along the lines of a SUBSCRIBE and get NOTIFYs from the server
with text to display while negotiating an IVR.

=20

Thx

The sigcomp-sip revisions look good. I have a couple of small comments 
on the new text that should be easy to resolve:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 8.3:
>    To indicate that such state will continue
>    to be available, the SigComp endpoint can inform its peer SigComp
>    endpoint by announcing the (partial) state ID in the returned SigComp
>    parameters at the end of the registration, dialog, or transaction
>    that was supposed to limit the lifetime of the SigComp state.

I think this is left-over language from the time that dialogs and 
transactions could have associated compartments. I suggest:

   To indicate that such state will continue  
   to be available, the SigComp endpoint can inform its peer SigComp
   endpoint by announcing the (partial) state ID in the returned SigComp
   parameters upon termination of the registration.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nit; Section 8.4:

> Section 9 provides network administrators with recommendations so that 
> they configure they networks properly.

...should be:

    Section 9 provides network administrators with recommendations so
    that they can configure their networks properly.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aside from these two small corrections, I think the document is ready 
for publication. I still believe that it would be improved by the 
addition of an example SIP message (instead of mere excerpts), and I am 
re-including my suggestion from a previous review below. However, I 
think the document serves its purpose even without the example, and see 
no reason to hinder its progress simply because it lacks such an example.

Hi All,
        Could some tell me where I can find source
code for SIP that I can modify using VC++. I need it
to perform the basic operations. Thanks in advance.

I agree that certificate-based authentication is useful, and have been
working a bit with CableLabs on this specification.

As Matt points out HTTP doesn't involve multiple hops but existing deployed
TLS offloaders do not provide back-end HTTP servers with information about
the TLS session; thus being able to include the certificate authentication
in HTTP itself would allow for usage with HTTP-over-TLS (primarily to
encrypt the transaction) and certificates to provide application-level
authentication (similar to today's use of HTTP's existing Digest and Basic
authentication).

So I support Steffen's idea, but I don't see a suitable APP working group to
standardize this for HTTP.  The immediate need is for SIP.  Perhaps it can
be done in SIP and if there is sufficient interest in the HTTP community
they can adopt a similar (or identical) technique as whatever we create for
SIP?

<BODY><table ><tr><td>
Hi!<br><br>

How are you? My name is Ekaterina. I from Russia, city Cheboksary. To me <br>
28 years. I shall tell to you about myself a little.<br><br>

I corresponded with the man from the your country before. His name Mark. He is<br>
from your country. We had a long correspondence and Mark wanted, that I have<br>
arrived to him in the your country that I have seen what life there. We have<br>
together submitted the statement on reception of the visa in your country! Mark<br>
spoke, that will help my in our meeting. I thought, that have met on<br>
the Internet the love.<br><br>

I and Mark made the big plans for the future, but in a flash all has<br>
changed. From the moment of submission of the statement for the<br>
application of the visa has passed 5 months. For these five months<br>
there was for what I least waited. Mark informed, that his former wife<br>
has returned to him and lives together with him. Soon they should get<br>
married. And now in Mark plans there is no me. I wrote to him some<br>
times after that, but Mark have wished me only good luck in the<br>
further searches worthy men and have told, that our ways miss. And in<br>
October to me there has come the invitation in embassy behind<br>
reception of the visa.<br><br>

In the beginning I wanted to throw out the invitation in embassy.<br>
To me it was sad, because my dreams were failed, I have nobody to fly<br>
in the your country. But my uncle have dissuaded me from resolute actions and<br>
have told, that else there is a chance to find worthy the man and to<br>
use the visa to a meeting with him. I well know English and<br>
practically I have visa your country. My uncle speaks, that it really solves<br>
many problems.<br><br>

Approximately in 7 days the visa will be ready, and I should go to Moscow<br>
behind reception of the visa. I write to you because in my heart there<br>
is an empty seat. I do not search rich or poor. I search careful and<br>
responsible man which wants to enjoy a life together. Is this person<br>
you? I think, that I ask not much. I have told to you a little about<br>
my life. I have told not all about myself, but it will be easier to me<br>
to write about myself if you will ask questions which interest you. I<br>
have told to you my history, and now I shall look forward to hearing<br>
from you with impatience. Write to me! I shall send you more photo in<br>
the following letter. I wait you answer. Ekaterina.<br><br>

P.S. I shall answer with pleasure if you write to me on:blonde1979u@yandex.rua>

I agree that certificate based approach is useful. I am unconvinced  
that there is a situation where it is both

1) you need to have a proxy between the UA that is authenticating and  
the client it is authenticating to

2) there are no other huge security holes introduced by having the  
middle proxy that is not trusted

So - if there is a need for this, then I agree we should look at  
something along these lines. Note that this WG is probably the wrong  
place to design an HTTP authentication scheme that works with  
untrusted intermediaries.

If the intermediaries are not needed, then I think an approach where  
the UA has to do outbound so that the proxy never forms a connection  
to the UA could be used and in this case the UA could present a  
certificate in the TLS handshake that identified the device. Folks  
have been talking about this for several years but waiting for  
outbound to get finished before starting it. Note that this *only*  
works if you know that this certificate will not end up used in a  
normal TLS situation because the certificate will have a device name,  
not a DNS or IP address in it thus the entanglement with outbound.

(1) Some mechanism is required for transporting client certificate if
it's not possible to use identity-info as described in RFC 4474

A new header could be defined as follows
       Identity-Cert =3D "Identity-Cert" HCOLON ident-cert
       ident-cert =3D LDQUOT 32LHEX RDQUOT
       32LHEX =3D BASE64 encoded client certificate.

(2) Following scenario need to be supported (Using Example in Sec 8 to
elaborate) if permitted by Registrar's local policy
    =20
    Bob's hardphone UAC using certificate for authentication.
    Bob's softphone UAC using username/password for authentication.

With following restrictions
    - Both UAC using same AOR.
    - Bob's softphone UAC is not aware of this specification.


(3) An optional algorithm "rsa-enc" for producing challenge response as
follows

     - UAC sends the initial request with Identity-Cert OR Identity-Info
headers.
     - Registrar validates the certificate and verifies that the owner
of the certificate
       is authorized to submit the request.
     - Registrar then creates a unique password for this instance of the
client, encrypts
       the password using UAC's public key and sends that to client
along with other parameters
       in the WWW-Authenticate header.
     - UAC uses it's private key to extract the password from the
WWW-Authenticate header
     - UAC then uses this password to create the challenge-response.

This optional mechanism can be used by implementations to minimize the
number public key operations
at the expense of maintaining state for each authenticated UAC.
Server should delay creation of state until UAC has proven possession of
private key by sending the=20
correct challenge response. Server can implement this by encrypting the
password with it's own public key=20
or a symmetric key known only to server and sending that inside opaque
field of the WWW-Authenticate
header.

Hi all,

We have submitted a draft clarifying the privacy mechanism.
The draft replaces our previous draft discussed in SIPPING
at IETF67 in San Diego. We have tried to incorporate the
comments given at the previous meeting, and as a result,
it is now in a scope of SIP WG, we believe.

The draft is intended to obsolete RFC 3323. It redefines the
Privacy mechanism and specifies priv-values of "nw-level",
"all", and "none". The draft makes an assumption that when
user requests privacy, it is based on a binary decision.
The user either requests privacy for the whole message or
no privacy at all.

"nw-level"
Request that a privacy service removes or obscures
intermediary inserted/modified information.

"all"
Request that a privacy service removes or obscures all user
privacy related information, i.e. both user inserted
information and intermediary inserted/modified information.

"none"
A privacy service should not perform any privacy functions
for the purpose of obscuring user agent's information.

The draft also describes the desired treatment of each SIP
header/parameter that contains user privacy related information.

Any suggestions and comments would be appreciated.

Just as a bit of point of which works better .... if you and I are  
both behind NATs and we want to have SIP flow between us without  
using a relay outside our NATs, SIP over UDP works in a much higher  
percentage of NATs that TCP. This is a big topic for the P2PSIP  
group. But I think this actually does illustrate your point in some  
ways - different transports have different characteristics and SIP  
allows deployments to choose the transport that meets their needs.

The draft below defines a mechanism to use DNS-SD (aka "Apple  
Bonjour") for distributing SIP URIs within a LAN. Feedback is most  
welcome.


	Title		: SIP URI Service Discovery using DNS-SD
	Author(s)	: J. Lee, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-lee-sip-dns-sd-uri-00.txt
	Pages		: 17
	Date		: 2007-2-26
	
    This document describes the Session Initiation Protocol Uniform
    Resource Identifier (SIP URI) advertisement for DNS-based Service
    Discovery (DNS-SD).  Using this mechanism, a SIP user agent (UA) can
    communicate with another UA even when no SIP registrar is available,
    as in a wireless ad-hoc network for example.

How you would be able to establish such a UDP flow without some
rendezvous point in the public Internet is also very interesting indeed.

What you are basically saying is that since UDP works better in this P2P
scenario, application protocols should steer away from using TCP and
instead use UDP and then build the TCP state machine into the
application protocol itself. Why is it so hard to admit that this is
just a bad idea? Isn't it a clear layer violation as well?

Perhaps this is something that should really be solved for all protocols
and not specifically for SIP. This would actually be a good case for the
generality over efficiency principle.

Cheers,
Aki

agreed -  there would be something outside the NATs, but it would be  
involved in helping initiate the connection and would not need to be  
involved after the connection was formed

Aki, I did not mean to say that at all.  What I was saying is that  
the blanket claim that TCP works better through NATs and thus we  
should all use TCP is not 100% true. Some time TCP works better  
through NATs some times it does not.

I think that using TCP is a good idea in the SIP case - and, for me,  
the one strongest argument for why it is a good idea to use TCP is  
that: it is an efficiently and reliably way to transport large chunks  
of data - and SIP message are getting large. Many of the other  
arguments that get brought up I don't find as compelling.  
Specifically thought I feel their is some truth to all the following,  
for me they seem to have two sides or not be all that compelling.

1) SIP over TCP works better through nats - sometimes, sometimes not

2) SIP over TCP is easier to implement - they both have issues and  
they are a drop in the bucket of the overall complexity and work of  
doing a sip device

3) SIP over UDP causes congestion collapse - it does have an  
exponential backoff and the elephant under the rug is not the SIP but  
the fixed rate media

4) SIP over TCP is more scalable - in theory this is true, in  
practice as of today it is clearly not true given what is available  
for deployers to use. Again, I expect this to change over time but I  
think we are not there yet.

5) SIP over TCP is more reliable - various people have various high  
reliability schemes some work better with one protocol or the other -  
as the SIP wg defines ways to do high reliability, this may become  
less of an issue

As I said, I don't find the 1-5 really all that compelling on the UDP/ 
TCP debate one way or the other.  I'm a fan of moving towards TCP but  
not until it actually practical and I want us to move for the right  
reasons and not just the grass is greener on the other side. At the  
last few IETF, I've mumbled that if people are serious about this,  
writing a draft wold be the thing to do.

Cullen <with my individual hat pulled well down over my eyes>


PS - I do wonder at times about the the implications for mobile  
networks of encouraging large (like 10k) and very large  (like 100k)  
SIP messages.

This touches a concern I have that's been growing throughout this  
thread.

There seems to be some subset of the discussion that is shaped more  
or less like
"If we can forbid SIP over UDP, all these bad things go away and the  
world is a much better place"
where it would be more appropriate to say
"If we can forbid SIP over UDP, these problems go away, and we'll  
have to focus more on these other problems now".

Deprecating SIP over UDP is not a magic-bullet/low-hanging-fruit/duh- 
why-didn't-we-do-this-years-ago proposition.
If it were, we _would_ have done it already (actually, the  
implementers would have done it for us and we'd be playing
catchup).

That said, I'll stand up next to Cullen here. I'm a fan of moving  
away from the current UDP state machines. I think there
_are_ the right reasons and we need to really understand them before  
pulling any rugs out from under anything.
I'm a fan of moving towards TCP because it's the most sensical option  
available to us.

Any transition we facilitate will have to be gradual if it's going to  
be meaningful.

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

I'd like to close on the few remaining issues in the To-Do list of
draft-ietf-sip-sips-01, as=20
described in Annex B.

Most of the issues in Annex B are related to how to treat "derived
sessions" where there is a
missmatch between the URI scheme used by the different sessions.

For example, say a session started with SIPS, and then a REFER is sent
using a Refer-to URI that
points to a sip sheme. A similar issue could occur with third party call
control.

I am reluctant to write ultra precise procedures attempting to cover all
prossible problems that=20
could happen on this issue, because it just seems that it would be too
complicated and arcane
to explain.

Rather, I would propose that I write some general guidelines on the
principle of not downgrading
security by allowing a derived session to effectively downgrade from
SIPS to SIP. And then, I'd add
an example or two of common cases.

For example, a REFER in a session using SIPS should not point to a
Refer-To that is SIP. The UAS=20
that receives such a request should either
1) Warn the user about the downgrade and as for persmission to accept it
(similar to text alreay=20
   in RFC 3515)
2) Reject it, probably with 403 "Forbidden".

Do people agree with this approach?
Suggestions?

Another open issue in Appendix B of draft-ietf-sip-sips is related to
GRUU.

It says:

   For GRUU, how should the UAC react if the returned GRUU is SIP but
   the To was SIPS?  How should the UAC react if the returned GRUU is
   SIPS but the To was SIP?

In other words, what if the registrar returns a GRUU with the wrong
scheme
in the response to REGISTER.

I can think of the following:

1 - UAC uses the GRUU anyways, BUT replace the scheme with the proper=20
    scheme in all usages of GRUU.

2 - UAC behaves as if it did not receive a GRUU at all.

I'm tempted to believe that option 1 is better.

Any opinions? Other ideas?

HTTP certainly allows an HTTPS web page to redirect to or reference  
an HTTP page. There are lots of legitimate use cases.

But is is conventional for the browser to warn the user.

3rd alternative: UAC uses the GRUU as it was returned, but warns the  
user.

Use case: You need a GRUU, but the server just can't knit you a sips:  
GRUU.

And the only people who will understand the error message will
be IETF SIP WG participants (and probably not even all of us).

Unlike a REFER scenario, this seems way to arcane.

Assuming the warning was more of the "can't do security" variety,
(instead of GRUU specifically), it would then need to be accompanied
by a wholesale downgrade to sip. So in my mind, the UAC would have
to re-REGISTER (if acceptable). Is that what you mean?

I find this kind of scary: wouln't the REGISTER then just reject
the REGISTER altogether with 416 "Unsuported scheme" which would
then trigger the client to re-REGISTER using sip?

same resource.

So what do you really mean by server can't knit a GRUU? Keep in mind
this
is a case where server accepts the SIPS in the To, From and Contact, but
nevertheless chooses a sip GRUU. I'm scratching my head trying to figure
out why this is a valid scenario. And if it is, why rejecting the
REGISTER
wouldn't be better.

Francois,

I agree as long as you get the wording right, which I think you are on 
track to do.

The fundamental thing is that a session to a UA never be downgraded 
*from what the user of the UA thought it to be* without the express 
permission of that user (directly or via configured policy.) Session 
here is a bit loose, since we are talking about replacing one dialog 
with another while thinking of it as a single session.

This certificate-based scheme isn't different from existing 
state-of-the-art (SIP Digest) in its model of trusting that 
first-hop SIP proxy or having a different proxy perform the 
registration functions.

That is, if your first SIP proxy and your registrar are two
different computers, those same two cases above exist with
SIP Digest.

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006.
The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007
Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the
most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as
Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to
be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with
general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a
number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new
graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and
toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.
Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief
amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for
smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks
before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office
Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for
Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server
architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time
between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a
web page. While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been
removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its
successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Francois, Paul,

Don't forget that REFER can be used in a number of different ways, not all
of which result in replacement of one dialog by another. In fact the
semantics of REFER do NOT mean replace a dialog and it is up to the sender
of the REFER request to clear down the old dialog if appropriate (e.g., on
receiving a NOTIFY request indicating success of the referred request).
Admittedly the particular case where a REFER request is sent on an
INVITE-initiated dialog and causes a new INVITE-initiated dialog to be
established will generally result in replacement of the original dialog, but
REFER itself does not actually say that this must be so.

One example of the use of REFER is with a method that does not form another
INVITE-initiated dialog, e.g., method=SUBSCRIBE. Here it is arguable that
the SUBSCRIBE request-URI can be completely decoupled from the security
state of the existing dialog.

Another use is sending REFER outside the context of a dialog. In such a
case, I guess the REFER Request-URI could be SIPS and the Refer-To URI could
be SIP, or vice versa.

I support trying to put in some general words, rather than being
over-prescriptive. However, please make sure the words are general enough to
cover all REFER scenarios.

Another related topic is Replaces. I would presume that an INVITE/Replaces
request to a SIP URI would not be considered to match an existing
INVITE-initiated dialog on the UA concerned that uses a SIPS URI as contact,
or vice versa. Does this need spelling out?

John

Hello,


  About  draft-ietf-sip-outbound-07, I want to ask the following.


Q-1)

  About the edge proxy mechanisms I read

{
5.1.  Processing Register Requests

    When an Edge Proxy receives a registration request with a reg-id
    header parameter in the Contact header field, it needs to determine
    if it (the edge proxy) will have to be visited for any subsequent
    requests sent to the user agent identified in the Contact header
    field, or not.
}


  Because there is a " need to determine" then must be some cases that =20
"the edge proxy could not be visited again".
  So I do not understand in the text above why "the edge proxy could =20
not be visited again for any subsequent requests sent to the UAC in =20
the Contact header  field".

  I can only imagine one situation. The edge proxy could notice that =20
the domain of the UAC registering (in Contact header field) could =20
imply that it (the edge proxy) is not going to be visited again due =20
that to reach that UAC in the future the edge proxy will be not =20
involved...

  Could you clarify the situation?


Q-2)

  How can the edge proxy determine if it will have to be visited again?


Regards,

Sergio

I've submitted a minor update to acr-code which addresses some comments 
made by the chairs during proto writeup. Until it appears in the 
archives, you can pick it up at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-acr-code-04.txt

Only real change is a clarification that the reason a UAC MUST NOT retry 
a request without anonymity after a 433, is that user preferences for 
anonymity would not be met.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

To be clear, the IV itself is not included in the hash, right? Its 
merely used to seed the process?

John,

I agree that those cases when REFER is used to replace one session with 
another are a subset of the total set of uses for REFER. In responding 
to Francois I was only considering that subset. I do think that the 
parties involved know this is the case. Certainly when the REFER results 
in an INVITE/Replaces, both the sender and the recipient know this.

There may indeed be more that can be said, still in a general way, about 
other uses of REFER. I don't know if we want this draft to attempt that. 
I suspect not.

Well, it's transitively included in the hash because we're going
to MAC EA.

That said, there's a bit of a race condition here because 
draft-rescorla-stateless-tokens-00 defines a generalized
version of this stateless token technique. It may be best to
simply define GRUU as using that technique.

Hi all,

Over the last few years, a number of perceptual media quality objective
measures and assessment techniques have been standardized by ITU-T. For
example, MOS-LQO, MOS-CQO, etc. Each one of these parameters could have
number of variations like narrow-band/wide-band, electrical/acoustical,
full reference/no-reference, audio/video, etc. When applied within a
network end-point, each media direction (ingress/egress) could have one
or more of these values associated with it. We need a way to report
these values efficiently without any ambiguity. These MOS values could
be sent/distributed as perceptual objective quality SIP events. In this
way, all the advantages of SIP like mobility, etc. will be pulled in.

=20

I would like to propose a work/discussion item on an event package for
this purpose. Even define/specify a quality reporting framework. Is
there any interest out there?

=20

I presume that, an event package work will be within SIPPING WG, where
should we do the framework work? SIP/AVT?

=20

Thanks.

Ravi.

This is a great draft, ekr. I think it will come in handy in lots of 
places.

A couple of questions.

Firstly, what is the current status on this? Are you going to push this 
through as an AD-sponsored individual? Or is it an IAB doc? Or for a WG? 
What is the timeline?

Assuming it will be going forward, I think it would be fine to reference 
it. The reference can be informative since the entire appendix is an 
informational appendix on how to do this. This way GRUU won't block on 
it. So, what we'd need to do is restructure the text in that appendix to 
use your tokens draft.

I *think* that all we need to do there is specify the format for the 
string S, which would be:

AOR || " " || instance-ID || W || T1 || T2 || .. || Tn

and then tell folks to use your draft to construct a state token. I 
think we'd ignore sequence numbers and timestamps; making these zero. 
The reason is that temp-gruu don't have a fixed expiration time, its 
linked to expiration of the contacts and thats why W is in the state 
itself. Similarly for sequence numbers; T1.. Tn form our sequence number 
as part of the state, not in the token itself. Do you agree?

After the token is constructed, the user part becomes

user-part = "GRUU" || BASE64(token)

Is that right?

If so I will draft some text for this right now and post it.

I'm in the process of updating GRUU for the other main change we agreed, 
on how to invalidate temp-gruu on the client side.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

All good questions. I just fired off mail to the SEC ADs and

Hmm... So, we're assuming there's no way to revoke tokens other
than terminating the underlying registration? I'm trying to decide
if that's really true.

Yeah, that sounds right.

Yes, I think the general approach is the correct one.
The example is good, but as you're making it concrete, keep in mind
applications like directory services. (I might want my call to directory
assistance to be secured, but when the connect me to the party I'm
interested in, I would probably be willing to downgrade, especially
if they didn't offer secure communication - having me explicitly give
permission (by staying on the line after a verbal warning perhaps)
is reasonable to me.)

This kind of feels like the "what do we say to do when something  
wildly violates the spec" conversation.
(My current read of GRUU says that the registrar went off the rails  
to do this - am I wrong?).

In the past, we've shied away from specifying recovery behavior for  
all these cases - there are just too many
of them. There have been times when it's been important to specify  
what happens because of (usually) security
issues. Maybe this is one of those. If it is, the clarification needs  
to land in the GRUU spec I think.

My own inclination is to say 2), and say it in the GRUU document.

Yes, this is exactly what it is: it's the case where the registrar went =
off
the rails.

I'm perfectly happy with your suggestion that we do (2).

I don't care if we say it in this document or in GRUU.

Jonathan? Any preferences?

Ok, makes sense.

I think it will be consistent with some of the wording in the security =

Yes, I think the general approach is the correct one.
The example is good, but as you're making it concrete, keep in mind
applications like directory services. (I might want my call to directory
assistance to be secured, but when the connect me to the party I'm
interested in, I would probably be willing to downgrade, especially
if they didn't offer secure communication - having me explicitly give
permission (by staying on the line after a verbal warning perhaps)
is reasonable to me.)

Yes, since we have no way to inform the client that they've been 
revoked, beyond terminating the registration.

I suppose a server could revoke a single temp-gruu without informing the 
client about it, or we could develop mechanisms in the future to inform 
the client. In that case, you would want the sequence number. The text 
could indicate that the sequence numbers would be used in the future if 
such capabilities were added.

The timestamp would still be empty though, unless we had, in the future, 
a mechanism for time-limited temp-gruu. Again the text could say that to 
leave the door open.

So, its now a month and a half since posting this, and days before the 
deadline I am getting to do this. And of course, as always seems to 
happen, on re-reading the threads and documents to re-cache the issues, 
I find another problem :(

The algorithm below works fine, but omits a case. The case that is 
omitted is where the server doesn't send a partial notification, and 
instead sends a full-state notification that comes after the 
registration is refreshed. The flow is like this:


UA        Reg

                (reg decides to shorten duration to 5s)

NOTIFY (5s)
<-----------

REGISTER       (misses the window, and registration lapses briefly)
------------>
200 OK
<------------

NOTIFY (1hr)   (reg never bothered to send NOTIFY for expiration since
<------------   it was refreshed a second later. So, rather than sending
                 two notifications, it combined and sent one with the
                 most recent state)


In this case, the 'glitch' that occurred - the temporary expiration of 
the contact followed by its re-registration, is NEVER known by the 
client. So, the server invalidated all of the temp-gruu, but the client 
doesn't know it.

One solution is to REQUIRE a server to always send all state changes, 
never to combine them. I don't like this, since you still might have 
cases where the client misses a notification due to packet loss or 
something, and then you have the same problem over again. IMHO, you need 
a way for the client to be sure that it is in sync with the server on 
which temp-gruu are valid, and which are not.

Fortunately, the solution here is relatively straightforward. The 
reg-event notifications include the cseq value present in the 
registration that first registered this contact. RFC 3680 already 
includes the total time elapsed since this contact was registered, but 
since we're dealing with race conditions, the timestamps aren't good 
enough. This would be a new element, <orig-cseq>, a child to <contact> 
in the reg-event XML.

Whenever the client gets a reg-event notification, it invalidates any 
temp-gruu learned in a REGISTER that had a cseq value earlier than the 
<orig-cseq>.

This provides a way for the client to, at any time, synchronize its set 
of valid temp-gruu with what the server has. So, it resolves this 
additional case above, in addition to providing a way to verify 
synchornization at any time, in case the client gets confused.

Now, an important point here. Its not just the cseq, its also callid. 
The callid is part of this since cseq are scoped within a particular 
callid (as defined in RFC 3261). Interestingly, this provides, as a 
side-effect, a way for a client to tell the server to invalidate temp-gruu.

The client would just generate a register refresh, changing the callid.
When it does this, it will, by the algorithm above, invalidate its 
temp-gruu locally. If we specify that the server does the same, then 
this provides a way for a client forcefully invalidate all previous 
temp-gruu without loss of connectivity.

This is trivially done statelessly, by changing the hash algorithm to 
use the orig-cseq and call-id in the hash, rather than wallclock time.

The main drawback really is that its a bit of feature creep. Again.

My recommendation is to do it anyway, since I need to put about 95% of 
it in there just to deal with the race condition problem described 
above. The extra 5% is just an instruction to servers to invalidate 
temp-gruu when the call-id changes. That bit is what provides the 
feature whereby the client can forcefully expire temp-gruu.

Thoughts?

Dale,

I'm a bit nervous about this. Two things concern me.

One, if there is stuff that is not clear in GRUU, such that it requires 
clarification in this document, shouldn't we just clarify it in GRUU? If 
so, can you please make those comments directly?

Two, what about things in here that conflict with GRUU?

I'd like to get your thoughts on this.

I also don't understand the purpose of this draft, since you do in fact 
say that you don't plan on advancing it. Can you clarify what its 
purpose is?

Some specific comments, related to these two issues above:

> The feature tag for the GRUU extension is "gruu".
> 
>    Guideline 1:  The UA should add "Supported: gruu" to its requests and
>                  responses, and accept "Require: gruu" in requests.

This is a MUST in GRUU, not a SHOULD as you have here. So we have a 
conflict. The MUST in GRUU is important; its what triggers the server to 
inform the client of its gruu.

>  Guideline 2:  Some UAs implement non-standard mechanisms for handling
>                  URIs that compensate for the fact that heretofore many
>                  contact URIs have not been globally routable.  Since
>                  any URI containing the "gr" parameter is known to be
>                  globally routable, a UA should not apply such
>                  mechanisms to any URI containing the "gr" parameter.

So, here is a piece of advice which is not in gruu. Seems like it could 
be added. I'm not sure about what techniques UA apply to contacts; 
proxies, registrars and B2buas definitely do munge them. Is that what 
you mean?

> Guideline 3:  All GRUUs exist both in the "sip" and the "sips" URI
>                  schemes, and UAs must be capable of processing both

>                  capable of processing any contact URIs in those

well, this is not true anymore in gruu. The whole issue has been 
deferred to the sips-guidelines draft. So I would not want to put this 
into the core gruu document.

> Guideline 4:  Each UA instance has an "instance ID" which is globally
>                  unique through all space and time.  An instance ID

all of this is said in sip-outbound.

this is reasonable, but NOT specified in sip-outbound. It you want this 
behavior, it should go there.

these all would belong in sip-outbound. They are not there now.

this is all in GRUU-11 already. Is there something in GRUU-11 that you 
think needs to be clarified on this point?

Most but not all of this is in sip-outbound. The stuff about escaping is 
not. Again if you think this is unclear, it should go in sip-outbound.

already in gruu-11, and clear I think.

this is not in gruu-11. I can add that.

> Guideline 12:  If a REGISTER returns a new GRUU for an AOR/instance

this is in GRUU-11 and clear I think.

this is NOT in gruu-11. It could be added there. The 'line' URI 
parameter is not something defined currently. I suspect this is a 
proprietary parameter you use in your implementation. BLISS is probably 
the right place to discuss the problems motivating it.

both of these are in gruu already.

Maybe, maybe not. This guideline is dangerous, since it seems to tell 
implementors that they can ignore the contact in target refresh requests 
if the original one was a gruu. That is not true.

this is mostly covered in gruu, but I don't understand the bit about 
forking.


Thanks,

Hi all,
Number of people asked me to discuss this in the SIPPING list.
So, let's discuss it over there.

If you are interested in this topic, please have a look over there.

Thanks.

Some things that might be different:

- sending in-dialog REFER vs out-of-dialog

- using the To-URI rather than the Contact for things like Refer-To

I'd prefer option 1. The reason is, if the registrar does properly 
handle the sips version of your gruu, but just didn't tell you about it, 
then in option 1, things still work.

Specifying this doesn't belong in GRUU since we had decided previously 
to eliminate almost all discussion on SIPS from GRUU. So it would be way 
out of place to say it there.

Indeed, since we are saying that sip and sips URI are basically 
equivalent, I would argue that the scheme in the To header field of the 
REGISTER is really irrelevant entirely. The key is really the R-URI and 
Contact in the register. If they are both sips, then the result is a 
"secure" link from the client to the registrar. Once that is in place, a 
call to the sips version of the AOR can be routed over this link, using 
the sips COntact and sips Path that would have been created by the 
registration. Similarly a call to a SIP URI could use that link too.

Another related point, with current registrar behavior of replacing the 
R-URI with the registered contact, if I send a REGISTER request with a 
sips Contact and sips URI, and then someone sends me a call to the sip 
version of my AOR, the r-uri will be translated to the sips contact I 
had registered. So how does a sips-only client reject this? I'm 
referring to paragraph 4 in section 5. Not a GRUU question per se, but 
related.

I'll note that this issue is solved with UA loose route.

Yes, this was my preference as well, for exactly the same reason.

I'm ok with both 1 and 2, but I prefer 1.

I'll wait to see if anybody elses chimes in. If not, and I don't get
strong pushback from Robert, I'll use the option 1 approach.

I'm still very nervous.
What about something in the middle twidding bits (replacing sips: =20
with sip: in the GRUU in the contact in the register response?)
I see the sunny case working that you're describing, but are you sure =20=

its not enabling something you don't _want_ to work?

If the answer is 2) then I disagree. It is more or less the same as =20
saying what to do if your gruu parameter comes back with an http: URI =20=

in it.

? I'm lost. Probably by the same thing that made me ask the question =20
above.
Maybe I'm not following Francois draft closely enough - did we decide =20=

to allow upgrades when retargeting?

Actually, I the problem you are refering to affects not
only REGISTER, but any requests that has a Contact (like
an INVITE, if you expect mid-dialog requests).

That problem is something that I noticed was a big problem
in earlier versions of this draft (i.e., draft-ietf-sip-sips-00,
and the individual drafts draft-audet-sip-sips-guidelines).
Basically, it was broken

I had done a change in this version of the draft (i.e.,
draft-ietf-sip-sips-01) to address this. Look at the
second paragraph of section 4. (The call flows have been
adjusted for this too).

Basically, it says that the proxy must keep the same=20
scheme (sip or sips) that was in the incoming request
before delivering it (i.e., sip -> sip, and sips -> sips).
If we don't do that, we'll have the problem you are
describing, but we'll also have a bigger problem with
mid-dialog requests.

To me this is consistent with the idea that schemes are=20
equivalent from a routing perspective.

So yes, the proxy replaces the contact with the registered
contact, but it keeps the originial scheme of the request
that it is forwarding.

> I'll note that this issue is solved with UA loose route.

Yes it would. But I think proxies should nevertheless
keep the same scheme (sip or sips) when forwarding a
request to the client. Otherwise, it makes SIPS=20
dependent on loose routes. I do not think that it would be
warranted to make that a dependency.

ok, I'm stuck.



Keith's draft PROTO writeup for draft-ietf-sip-answermode-01 says:

in reference to document text, which currently says:

> UA includes a SIP extension feature tag of:

I'm not exactly sure how to resolve this and need guidance from the =20
WG on how it should be documented.

As I understand it, RFC 3840 defines the sip.extensions feature tag =20
as follows:

10.15.  Extensions

    Media feature tag name: sip.extensions

    ASN.1 Identifier: 1.3.6.1.8.4.15

    Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: Each value of =20=

the
       sip.extensions feature tag (note the plurality) is a SIP =20
extension
       (each of which is defined by an option-tag registered with IANA)
       that is understood by the UA.  Understood, in this context, means
       that the option tag would be included in a Supported header field
       in a request.

    Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Token with an
       equality relationship.  Values are taken from the option tags
       table in the IANA SIP parameters registry.

    The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
       applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: =20
This
       feature tag is most useful in a communications application for
       describing the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.

    Examples of typical use: Choosing to communicate with a phone that
       supports quality of service preconditions instead of one that =20
does
       not.


The SIP extensions feature tag refers to extensions by their option =20
tags. The answermode draft defines  an options tag:

8.3.  Registration of SIP Option Tags

This document defines the SIP option tag "answermode".

The following row shall be added to the "Option Tags" section of the =20
SIP Parameter Registry:
Name	        Description	          Reference
answermode 	This option tag is for    [RFCXXXX]
                 support of the Answer-Mode
                 and Priv-Answer-Mode
                 extensions used to
                 negotiate automatic or
                 manual answering of a
                 request.

Editor Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of =20
this document.




So, what's not clear? Is it "SIP extension feature tag" instead of =20
"sip.extensions feature tag"? What's the preferred construction?

Hi Ravi
 
The industry has been doing this for some time - there is an existing draft
in SIPPING - for the SIP RTCP Summary Report that does exactly what you are
asking for, also RTCP XR (RFC3611), RTCP HR (current AVT WG draft), and a
laundry list of other protocols for MGCP, Megaco.......  In some cases (e.g.
RTCP HR, SIP) you can indicate the algorithm used to estimate quality, and
hence if you wanted to use PESQ in an active test then you could report
using the SIP RTCP Summary Report and indicate that the MOS estimation
algorithm was P.862.n
 
Regards
 
Alan

Subject: [AVT] Perceptual objective media quality reporting



Hi all,

Over the last few years, a number of perceptual media quality objective
measures and assessment techniques have been standardized by ITU-T. For
example, MOS-LQO, MOS-CQO, etc. Each one of these parameters could have
number of variations like narrow-band/wide-band, electrical/acoustical, full
reference/no-reference, audio/video, etc. When applied within a network
end-point, each media direction (ingress/egress) could have one or more of
these values associated with it. We need a way to report these values
efficiently without any ambiguity. These MOS values could be
sent/distributed as perceptual objective quality SIP events. In this way,
all the advantages of SIP like mobility, etc. will be pulled in.

 

I would like to propose a work/discussion item on an event package for this
purpose. Even define/specify a quality reporting framework. Is there any
interest out there?

 

I presume that, an event package work will be within SIPPING WG, where
should we do the framework work? SIP/AVT?

 

Thanks.

 

Ravi.

Hi Ravi
 
The industry has been doing this for some time - there is an existing draft
in SIPPING - for the SIP RTCP Summary Report that does exactly what you are
asking for, also RTCP XR (RFC3611), RTCP HR (current AVT WG draft), and a
laundry list of other protocols for MGCP, Megaco.......  In some cases (e.g.
RTCP HR, SIP) you can indicate the algorithm used to estimate quality, and
hence if you wanted to use PESQ in an active test then you could report
using the SIP RTCP Summary Report and indicate that the MOS estimation
algorithm was P.862.n
 
Regards
 
Alan

Subject: [AVT] Perceptual objective media quality reporting



Hi all,

Over the last few years, a number of perceptual media quality objective
measures and assessment techniques have been standardized by ITU-T. For
example, MOS-LQO, MOS-CQO, etc. Each one of these parameters could have
number of variations like narrow-band/wide-band, electrical/acoustical, full
reference/no-reference, audio/video, etc. When applied within a network
end-point, each media direction (ingress/egress) could have one or more of
these values associated with it. We need a way to report these values
efficiently without any ambiguity. These MOS values could be
sent/distributed as perceptual objective quality SIP events. In this way,
all the advantages of SIP like mobility, etc. will be pulled in.

 

I would like to propose a work/discussion item on an event package for this
purpose. Even define/specify a quality reporting framework. Is there any
interest out there?

 

I presume that, an event package work will be within SIPPING WG, where
should we do the framework work? SIP/AVT?

 

Thanks.

 

Ravi.

For what purpose? WIth option 2, this would cause a loss of function. 
WIth option 1, it has no effect.

Not that I can think of. Since the sip and sips URI are equivalent 
anyway, what harm can this do? Of course an attacker capable of 
modifying messages can do so much worse than tweaking a sip scheme to 
sips......

Which one can always specify in another draft. We agreed to keep SIPS 
out of GRUU entirely. THe fact that we are debating an open issue around 
how to use SIPS with GRUU is exactly why.

The above seems ok to me, though maybe it would be good to show with 
other options and make clear this is is an example:

   ... value that includes answermode. E.g.:

   ;extensions="100rel,answermode,gruu"

The intent is that valid values of the extensions feature tag should be 
values that are permitted to be used in a Supported or Required header. 
RFC 3427 defines the iana registry for those and the rules for extending 
it. You've included the iana considerations to define answermode as a 
new option, so the example should be legal.

   intermediate proxies can send 202 .
   In MESSAGE case 
   200 -> implies that the Msg has reached to destination
   202 -> that  proxy has recvd it & will frwrded it towards final 
   destination

   vishnu

As Byron pointed out, no absolutely not, a proxy can't send 202, only
a user agent.  But various sorts of intermediate server can be (from
the SIP point of view) user agents.

The response codes are discussed in RFC 3428:

   If the UAC receives a 200 OK response to a MESSAGE request, it may
   assume the message has been delivered to the final destination.  It
   MUST NOT assume that the recipient has actually read the instant
   message.  If the UAC receives a 202 Accepted response, the message
   has been delivered to a gateway, store and forward server, or some
   other service that may eventually deliver the message.  In this case,
   the UAC MUST NOT assume the message has been delivered to the final
   destination.  If confirmation of delivery is required for a message
   that has been responded to with a 202 Accepted, that confirmation
   must be delivered via some other mechanism, which is beyond the scope
   of this specification.
