Hi,
I have a couple of comments/questions on this draft.

3.2 Policy subscription
The MIME type defined in this draft for session-independent policies is
application/session-policy+xml. It is mentioned  that "a UA compliant to
this specification MUST support the User Agent Profile Data Set for
Media Policy", which (version -04) seems to define MIME type
application/media-policy-dataset+xml. I guess the MIME types should be
the same?

4.2 Overview, last sentence=20
It is said that "Both types of policies [applying to the offer, or both
to the offer and answer] are supported by session-specific policy
mechanism." Does this require a mechanism to indicate in the policy
whether the policy applies to offer, or both offer and answer? With this
kind of mechanism the endpoint would not have to request a policy
decision for the answer, if the policy applies only to the offer.

4.3.1 Offer in request, example on page 12
What should be the behaviour if the policy check at the end (messaages 9
and 10) indicate that the policy was unacceptable? Should there be a
re-INVITE or UPDATE, possible triggering a similar policy checking again
in the remote end? Would it be better to always wait for the policy
decision before answering with the final response?

Regards,
Simo

What is "this"?  Do people think it would be genuinely helpful to
finish "this"?

   If we did something, it would probably be an update to RFC 3427,
   and I don't see an awful lot of WG resources being consumed if we
   did, i.e. no impact on our existing workload.

   However, if we wrote it, would anybody that matters respect it?

Hi,

I don't think it would be very helpful - at least not if it's supposed =
to "forbid" things which are largely depoloyed already (and have been so =
for a number of years already).

   From: "DRAGE, Keith \(Keith\)" <drage@alcatel-lucent.com>

   Well, at the moment, what I am trying to do is get some understanding of
   what we should scope as valid SIP work.

I've been busy, so I may be behind in the discussion, but it's not
clear to me that there is anything that needs to be done specifically
for SIP.  I may well be wrong, but my impression is that MIME already
has the features and specifications neede so that a receiver can
decide whether it has adequately "understood" the document when it
only understands some components.  These mechanisms are all inherited
by SIP and I would expect be a sufficient set of rules.

E.g., a UAC that sends a request with a multipart body must expect
that some UASs will respond with 415, and have some strategy in place
for dealing with that situation.  Similarly, a UAC that sends a nested
multipart body must expect that some UASs will be unable to process
the nested multipart, and will either ignore it or reject the request
(as specified), and the UAC must be prepared to deal with that
situation.

Is there a reason we need to define new, narrower subsets of allowed
behaviors and define a SIP mechanism to negotiate these?

Dale

   Not sure if I read your comment right, but RFC3261 12.2.1.2 says

   When a UAC receives a 2xx response to a target refresh request, it
      MUST replace the dialog's remote target URI with the URI from the
      Contact header field in that response, if present.

   It does not say anything about 1xx responses here though...

Ack, you're right, I'm wrong.  I tried to check but didn't see
12.2.1.2, so I assumed that responses aren't target-refreshing.

However, there is a problem that was discussed long ago, which is that
a response (except to INVITE) isn't acknowledged, the UAS doesn't know
that the UAC has received it, and so doesn't know whether it can
abandon listening to its previous target address.  So a UA shouldn't
use responses to non-INVITE requests to update its target.

In regard to 1xx, it seems like a US should use the same contact in
1xx as it does in the 2xx.  If the 1xx is not reliable, the UA can't
depend on it for target refresh, so the same target refresh must be
done in the 2xx.  If the 1xx is reliable, the UA can depend on it, but
it seems unsafe to then provide a different target address in the 2xx
-- which one should be the resulting target?  (But upon receiving the
PRACK, the UAS does know that it can abandon the previous target.)

(Since provisionals and PRACKs are only used in INVITE transactions,
final responses are acknowledged, so my first rule of thumb is
satisfied.)

I've been getting a lot of offline questions asking for the "right"  
way to carry information related to the
session-usage (often information that's being tunneled around from  
companion or gatewayed protocols).

What we've got sitting around right now is probably not enough if we  
don't want a new wave of things using INFO. We
need at least an easily findable explanation of why with a pointer to  
which other tools would be better considered
for different types of applications.

Well, here are a couple of situations that people have repeatedly  
brought up at SIPits. (Keep in mind that I'm
passing this along, not championing any points).

1) Some still have to operate in an environment that has no DNS, even  
in the core.
      Their customers are demanding transport=tls to control the use  
of tls over one hop in this situation.

2) Some have indicated they operate in large enterprise-like  
networks, where the endpoint has an ephemeral address,
      one for which there's no way to populate NAPTR/SRVs to indicate  
a use of TLS when reaching that endpoint.
      Additionally, the endpoint has a cert (!).  They are required  
to register a contact that causes them to be reached
      with TLS, and are using transport=tls to do so.

Somebody may have pointed this out already, but 2976 _does_ prevent  
the use of INFO outside a dialog - bottom of
page 4:

      A 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist message MUST be sent by
       a UAS if the INFO request does not match any existing call leg.

INFO was written before there _WAS_ anything but an INVITE dialog  
usage (called a call-leg at the time), so any
discussion of its use in other contexts (like SUBSCRIBE) will  
necessarily be in another document.

I remember a strong consensus around it only being allowed in the  
context of an INVITE usage, but can't find
definitive text in any later document this morning. Can anyone else?

2 comments and a request...

Comment: Indeed, the use of transport=3Dtls seems fairly widespread.
   1     However, it is not clear at all to me that it is use
         consistently accross different implementations. In fact, I'm
         pretty sure it's not.

Comment: The concept of "one hop" with transport=3Dtls is tricky. The
presence
   2     of transport=3Dtls in a URI would presumably apply to the hop
         identifying that resource (i.e., the last hop), as opposed to
         the first hop. Latest draft (-04) discusses this.

Request: If people make comments on the use of transport=3Dtls, please
         be very specific on where you are envisioning it's usage, e.g.,
         Request-URI, Contact in Register, Contact in dialog-creating
         request, Record-Route, etc. It makes a big difference.

cases where we use transport=tls is in request uri.

Which hop???

UAC -----> Proxy 1  ------> Proxy 2 ------> UAS

If you put Request-URI of sip:uas@example.com;transport=3Dtls, to me, it
means the link between Proxy 2 and UAS would use TLS. I.e., the
parameter would apply to the
resource identified in the URI.   (I'm assuming Record-Routing is used
here).

The first hop (between UAC and Proxy 1) is basically what you would
select before sending the message (or if a Route header was used, it
would be in the Route
header). To me, it's self-evident in the actual transport anyways.

Everytime I run into this issue, it seems to me that basically what
people
are asking for is just a way to select TLS for the first hop. We don't
need
protocol on the wire for this: just a config option in the UAC.

Surely they need to register with TLS for this to be secure.=20
The transport could be self-evident again, from the one used
while performing the registration.

for example, lets say that UAS is pstn gw that needs to be contacted
over tls.  proxy 1 makes a decision to use this particular pstn gw,
rewrites r-uri so that it among other things contains transport=tls
parameter, and then forwards the request to proxy 2 that is a "dumb"
proxy whose purpose is to front end the gw.

i don't know another way to do this because sip uri scheme cannot be
upgraded to sips and sips scheme cannot be downgraded to sip.

Any of them - Be sure to notice the lack of DNS there.

How (if they don't have DNS) do they specify the use of TLS between  
Proxy1 and 2?
   More specifically - if Proxy1 retargets an initial request to  
Proxy2 based on either
    configuration or a registered contact, what's the RURI of the  
emitted request going to be?
   Then, what should it record route with?

I don't understand the last sentence - especially in the record-route/ 
route case.

So the unusual case here is that it _is possible_  (and even
meaningful) for the proxy to open a new connection to the UA
if the old one is gone. Are you saying that you would like the
proxy/registrar to remember that it should use TLS when it did so
as a side-effect of the registration arriving over TLS?

That would be a way we could go (and we should go all the way
and ignore what's in contact altogether if we go here), but you will
have to explicitly make 3rd party registration and any registration
that installs state that doesn't point exactly to the registering  
instance
illegal. (I know several people think this is a good idea, but I  
don't think
we've made that the official position of the working group yet have we?)

I have seen cases where transport=tls appears in the Record-Route where one 
hop between proxies uses TLS. For example:

  UAC--<TCP>-->Proxy1---<TLS>--->Proxy2--<TCP>--->Proxy3---<TCP>-->UAS

This is done using a SIP URI (not SIPS).

I have not been able to keep up with this discussion, but the question I 
have is: without transport=tls, how would you express the desire/need to do 
TLS for a SIP URI in a Record-Route or Route header? I am talking about a 
case where the proxy (Proxy2 above) supports TCP and TLS, but the selection 
of transport is made for the initial INVITE, and that same transport needs 
to be used for in-dialog requests?

cheers,

Which hop???

UAC -----> Proxy 1  ------> Proxy 2 ------> UAS

If you put Request-URI of sip:uas@example.com;transport=tls, to me, it
means the link between Proxy 2 and UAS would use TLS. I.e., the
parameter would apply to the
resource identified in the URI.   (I'm assuming Record-Routing is used
here).

The first hop (between UAC and Proxy 1) is basically what you would
select before sending the message (or if a Route header was used, it
would be in the Route
header). To me, it's self-evident in the actual transport anyways.

Everytime I run into this issue, it seems to me that basically what
people
are asking for is just a way to select TLS for the first hop. We don't
need
protocol on the wire for this: just a config option in the UAC.

Surely they need to register with TLS for this to be secure.
The transport could be self-evident again, from the one used
while performing the registration.

Juha -

The classic answer for this is that the gateway should have a DNS  
name with its NAPTR and SRV
records configured to specify exactly TLS. Do you agree that if you  
have DNS available, that's good
enough?

I think you're pointing to specifically the case where you don't have  
DNS records pointing to UAS,
is that correct?

it would be good enough if we had client and server srv records
separately, but unfortunately we don't.  currently there is no dns way
to tell "i want my proxy to be contacted by other proxies using tls and
by UAs using udp or whatever else.  so proxies have to use all kinds
configured information to figure out the transport protocol to their
peers.

I'd say you use no transport parameter in the Record-Route and you
do what 3261 recommends, which is to reuse the same TCP connection
(TLS on this case) for in-dialog requests.

Also, I'd like to point out that since Record-Route is by definition
hop by hop, in that case sips would mean exactly the same as=20
transport=3Dtls.

I'm not sure I understand what we are trying to achieve here.

Say UAC sends initial INVITE.

It chooses TLS for transport. No transport parameter. UAC does not
use SIPS and therefore does not expect TLS on each hop.

Proxy 1 forwards the request to proxy 2. If may or may not
use TLS (although it should use TLS if possible). It inserts
a Record-Route (or modifies Request-URI). In either cases, it does
not need to put a transport parameter.

Later, in-dialog request will be sent on each hop reusing the existing
established connections (TLS or TCP) as per current RFC 3261=20
procedures.

Or are we talking pass each other?

I'm just saying the first hop is whatever is selected when you
sent the message. Since it's the first hop, there the parameter would
be useless.

I'm trying to understand what you are pointing at. Is it=20
in-dialog requests? Is it forcing a specific hop (not the first or
last one) to be TLS, but not all the hops?

I think I'm missing something...

I was not thinking specifically of the Mutual-TLS case which is what
you are pointing to.

In the server-provided certificate case, the client would be responsible
to re-establish the TLS connection. The way to do this for
server-provided
certificate environments is using sip-outbound which does exactly what
you said (i.e., ignore the contact). The the registrar doesn't=20
"remember" anything: it just uses existing connections.

I tought that was agreed (in Montreal). I don't see any other way to be
honest.

Now, you do bring up a really good point for environments where people
use Mutual-TLS between a proxy and a UA. I guess we could still use an
outbound
model for this case. Or we could use some indication in the protocol.
Not sure it's worth it to add a transport parameter for that. Seems to
me to
be overly complex, and it wouldn't allow you to indicate that you=20
support many different transport.

The third party registration case with the transport parameter is weird
to
me. It would allow a UA to send a Registration unseculily (over TCP or
UDP), and
create a binding for a third party using TLS. Seems like it would make
the TLS
connection pointless (unless somehow the first party is secure some
other way).

Hi all -

  Not really sure where to post this question as I am just starting to
research this issue.

  We want to allow users to dial into our did voip number.   Our service will:

1.  get their phone number via caller ID.

2.  look up account data with this number.

3.  generate a wave file based on the data returned & play it to the
user over the established voip link.


How might this be done using DID origination and a VOIP stack?

Any ideas?


Thank you--

what if established connection breaks for one reason or another and
needs to be re-established for routing in-dialog request?  if there is
no transport info in request route, how does the proxy know which
transport to use?

If it uses Outbound, then connection gets re-established by=20
client automatically (based on keep-alives).

Otherwise, correct, you don't know.

I guess the real question is "do we need to solve this case"?

I guess to me it means that it would be useful only for=20
mutual TLS cases. Is this big enough of a problem to justify
the expense of having to deal with the parameter?

That's a question for the group. I don't have a strong opinion

proxy-to-proxy communication is important enough case to justify the
transport=tls parameter.

What's missing from this, Francois, is how the proxy knows to set up  
the RR with tls in the first place.
i.e. when it retargets how does it _know_ it's retargetting to  
something over tls vs tcp.
I disagree that implementation specific configuration is a good  
enough answer.
I'm happy with the answer "you set this information in DNS" when you  
have DNS.
What I'm not seeing is how you set this when you don't have DNS.

This is exactly where we are disagreeing.

How do you _tell_ P1 that you want to reach P2 using TLS in the first  
place.
As I said elsewhere in the thread, I don't think leaving this  
unspecified ("you just do this
with the configuration of the proxy") is the right answer. If you  
have DNS, you tell P1
about P2 using DNS. If you don't have DNS, using the transport  
parameter in the URI
you hand it seems pretty natural. That's how you're going to tell it  
to use udp or tcp...

Almost certainly. I hope the above helps us get to a common question.

But for that, you can use SIPS in Record-Route, no?

It would be semantically identical, no?

as i wrote earlier, the problem is lack of server srv records, which
forces proxy operators to configure (usually in db or radius) what to do
with their peers.

please first fix server srv records and then you can disagree.

i don't know and don't care, because i don't use sips uri scheme for
anything.  it is artificial to imply transport protocol from uri scheme,
when there is a way to tell it straight.  perhaps someone will later
invent some other secure transport protocol to be used with sips when
then implication will fail.

Any name can have SRV records. What distinguishes a server srv record  
from any other srv record to you?

xmpp client to server communication uses name
_xmpp-client._tcp.example.com and server to server communication nane
_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com.  this allows different proxies to be used
for client-to-server and server-to-server communication.

Ah - that doesn't make sense for SIP in general.

You can make it make sense for certain deployments, and what you can  
do in those cases
is give your client facing interface one name and your server facing  
interface another.

Something like
_sip._tcp.client-interface.example.com
_sip._tcp.server-interface.example.com

So, what else are you missing?

how do you tell your sip client to use the former name its srv queries?
in xmpp it is specified that in client srv query, a prefix _xmpp-client
prefix is always added to the name.

Juha,

I believe the issue you are implicitly identifying is the following: it 
should always be possible to deterministically determine the transport to 
use towards a next hop learned from a Record-Route header. For a SIPS URI 
that implies that the 'transport' parameter MUST be present, because (in 
theory) it could be both TCP and SCTP (ref RFC3261 section 18, where it says 
"[...] transport protocols like TCP and SCTP, or TLS over those [...]".). It 
is true that RFC3263 states that TCP SHOULD be used for SIPS in case there 
is either an explicit port or a numeric IP address, but that does not mean 
that it _was_ indeed used. And there is nothing in RFC3261 that says proxies 
MUST support TLS over TCP (it just says TLS and TCP).

A stateful proxy/endpoint could maintain state about which transport was 
used. For these connection oriented transports the connection itself can be 
used as such, but as you mentioned it may get closed at one point and then 
the state would be lost. In any case, stateless proxies must be able to 
determine the transport based on only the URI provided.

The use of transport=tls was deprecated for the above reason (SCTP can also 
go over TLS). So in your case you should be using 
"sips:host[:port];transport=tcp", there is no implication of transport in 
that.

And RFC3261 should be updated to say that proxies "MUST support TLS over 
TCP", along with some inconsistencies (e.g. 18.1.1 says "It is 5060 for UDP, 
TCP and SCTP, 5061 for TLS." while 18.2.1 says "(5060 for TCP and UDP, 5061 
for TLS over TCP)"

Regards,
Jeroen

outbound proxy FQDN to use, and upstream proxies would be given 
"server-interface.example.com" (by using that as domain in AORs).

For R-R, the proxy would use "client-interface.example.com" if it performed 
a location service lookup (i.e. assuming that next hop is then an endpoint), 
or "server-interface.example.com" otherwise.

Nevertheless, in the R-R it would probably be better to be explicit about 
the transport to use, and not rely on DNS SRV. Then there is no need to 
worry about client vs server interface protocol preferences, or proxies that 
use dynamic registration, or DNS SRV misconfiguration or lack of support for 
it.

Regards,
Jeroen

jeroen,

i agree with the above, but it only solves the r-r case.  i cannot use
sips + transport=tls as a substitute of transport=tls[/tcp] in request uri
because of sips upgrade/downgrade implication.

I think I finally understand what you are saying...

Say UAC sends request to Request-URI uas@p2;transport=3Dtls.

The transport parameter indicates that the resource in the
request URI (uas@p2) is the one that needs to be contacted with
TLS. Therefore, it would be the P1 -> P2 link that would use
TLS in this case (since P2 owns that domain). And P2 could use whatever=20
it wants for P2 -> uas@uaspc.p2. And similarly, uac -> P1 (or P1 to any
other
proxy between P1 and P2) could use whatever they want.

The use case would be where the UAC "trust" it own domain and does not
feel it necessary to use TLS, and/or the UAC "trusts" the target domain
for being responsible of that happens inside the target domain. And
finally,
the UAC does not really care if there are other types of proxies in the
middle (not responsible for a specific domain), that may not use
TLS.

While I understand that this is in theory something that could be
solvable, I'm not sure why it is such an interesting case. Seems to me
it is only of value if the only "vulnerable" hop is the one between the
source and target domains, and if there are no other proxies between
them
(e.g., no "Service provider").

In fact, it pretty much describes to me why you should be using SIPS in
the first place.

Do we *really* want to reintroduce transport=3Dtls for this case?

Side note: I just want to point out that RFC 2543 did NOT allow the=20
presence of the transport parameter at all in a Request-URI and 2543
servers would ignore it or remove it.=20

Ok - we're closer, but not quite together yet.

Lets start with a different message from the UAC where the RURI is  
simply
sip:something@P1

The authority for something@P1 (the person that might send a register  
request
with that in the To: header) wants requests to go to  
sip:someapplication@P2
and they want it to go over TLS. What they'd _like_ to do is send a  
register
request with a contact that says to use TLS, or at most, send a  
single URI
to the operators of P1 that describes where to send requests that  
show up
for something@P1.

What tools do we give them to make the statement they want to make?

Ok, so it has nothing to do with Request-URI then (which is what I
tought
we were talking about).

I don't believe that using transport=3Dtls in Contact for
Registration will generally work.

There are 2 cases:

>From =3D=3D To in REGISTER (First Party Registration)
-------------------------------------------------

	In this case, if we use SIP-Outbound, we DO already
	have a solution.

	With SIP-outbound, the connection used by the registration
	process is kept alive and reused for both incoming and=20
	outgoing requests.

	It has the advantage that it will support environments=20
	where server-provided certificates are used since
	the TLS connection will only be establishable by the
 	client.

	A a bonus, SIP-outbound also solves NAT and FW traversal, if=20
	there happens to be one.

	Their proposed solution of using a transport parameter
	will not work for server-provided certificates as the=20
	server will not be able to establish a connection with
	the client. Since server-provided certificates is by far
	the most commone deployment scenario (as opposed to=20
	Mutual TLS) for UAs, this is a big problem.

	Their proposed solution wouldn't work either if there is
	a NAT or Firewall. Again, big problem.

	Their proposed solution would therefore ONLY be=20
	suitable for environments where Mutual TLS is used, and
	where there are no NATs or Firewall.

	The SIP-outbound mechanism also works with Mutual TLS.

	Therefore, for this case, I do not believe that their
	mechanism is general enough to be standardized.

	This is described at lenght in the draft.


>From !=3D To in REGISTER (Third Party Registration)
-------------------------------------------------

	Third party registration is problematic for both their
	proposed solution, as well as for SIP-outbound.

	For SIP-outbound, well, it plainly doesn't work.

	For their proposed solution, it is a security problem
	since it effectively allows a non-secure user (the "authority"
	as you call it), to request that session be delivered securily.
	Dr, Evil person could hijack the "authority" role and redirects
	all sessions to wherever it wants, and the sessions would be
	"secured" with Dr. Evil.

	Furthermore, their proposed solution would not work in this=20
	case either with server-provided certificates, or if there
	is a NAT or Firewall. Again, big problem.

	To me, it means that Third Party Registration is just plain
	bad in a secure environment.=20

	In fact, I don't like the idea of allowing third party=20
	registration to allow a UAC with AOR in p1 domain to=20
	register a contact in a different domain (p2 in this case).
	That contact is effectively an AOR.=20

	How would I solve the problem?=20

	I would expect the other UA (sip:someapplication@P2) to do it's=20
	own registration in it's own domain P2, according to the rules
of it's
	own domain. If P2 is using server-provided certificates, it
would
	work (with Outbound). If a NAT is present, it would works as
well.

      Then, I would allow user "something@P1" to log in securily=20
	on the Proxy (with HTTPS for example), and request routing to=20
	be done to another address (in this case,
sip:someapplication@P@).
	To ensure that P1 would use TLS to P2 (as they want), I'd just
put
	a "User TLS" checkbox.

	That seems to me to be a lot less broken that trying to squeeze
it
	into third-party REGISTER.

Well, we're still not connecting quite yet.

It has _EVERYTHING_ to do with Request-URI.

It is coincidence that I'm populating what the RURI will
be after retargetting with a REGISTER. It could have been
any other mechanism. The important part is what comes
out into the Request-URI of the P1->P2 link.

(as you read my inline responses below, ask yourself what
  =tls has to do with what you wrote - I think I can substitute =tcp,
    which we _do_ allow, and everything but the comments about
    mutual or server auth still stand)

Surely you're not suggesting proxies do outbound between them.
You're latching onto the endpoint case. I'm talking about a server to  
server case.

This is getting closer to the P1->P2 hop, but its a bit of a herring  
that
you've separated 1st and 3rd party registration. I could have  
something@P1
in both to: and from: and still point it at application@P2.

I understand where you are going with "make that a checkbox on  
somebody's GUI" and
that's exactly what I'm saying isn't good enough. The preference  
needs to be reflected in the URI.

For the registration case, binding things between P1 and P2, let me  
try yet another way to say this.

It's in the field.
People are USING it.
We are trying to say "Don't do that" without giving an alternative  
that works in that scenario.
We will be ignored unless we can present a clear and compelling  
reason why someone
is putting life or limb at risk to do this (and I suspect we'll be  
ignored even then).

I'm not sure I can make any such argument around just this transport  
parameter. If we're
going to allow someone to say "udp" or "tcp" in this case, its rather  
pointless to not let them
say tls (with the appropriate caveats around not having the anchor in  
DNS to verify who
you're talking to).

I _can_ make an argument around the notion of putting state in that  
doesn't point directly to you,
but that goes way way beyond just the transport parameter, and if  
we're going to go there, we
need to start an entirely different conversation that will take the  
transport parameter completely
off the table for _any_ transport.

Juha (and Francois),

What I miss in the discussion and draft is the reason why transport=tls was 
deprecated, namely that TLS by itself is not a transport. The transport is 
either TCP or SCTP, TLS is the security layer on top of that

The "TLS" value for Via transport in RFC3261 should really be read as 
"TLS-TCP", just like there is now TLS-SCTP defined in RFC4168. The latter 
does *not* define a "tls-sctp" value for the 'transport' parameter (i.e. 
does not extend the definition for 'transport-param'), because it is not 
needed: the use of TLS is solely determined by the URI scheme

"sip"  ==> you MAY use TLS (but then upgrade the scheme to "sips:" in the 
request sent out)
"sips"==> you MUST use TLS (with possible exception for last hop, i.e. sips 
request URI rewritten by proxy to a sip URI obtained from a registered 
Contact)

RFC3261 also implicitly discusses the possibility of a "first hop 
exception", i.e. a UAC using a "sips:" scheme but not TLS (16.6 point 4). 
Note that it does not consider the reverse case of using TLS without "sips:" 
as scheme. Some implementations may use 'transport=tls' for this case, but 
it is - and should remain - deprecated (i.e. ignored if received, never 
generated).

For received Contact and Record-Route headers, it should be mandatory to 
maintain state information regarding the transport that was used towards 
that hop, and whether TLS was used or not. These are 2 separate items. The 
latter is covered by the "secure" flag in RFC3261, for proxies RFC3261 
assumes that "sips <==> use TLS" holds, so there is no need for separate 
state for proxies regarding the use of TLS.

Regards,
Jeroen

In section 4.2 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sips-04.txt proposes that 
a proxy should send 403 rather than apply the last hop exception.

Instead, I would propose that it would send a 302 with either the registered 
Contact or the received request URI with a "sip:" scheme. 403 would be 
confusing, because the caller cannot distinguish between this case and the 
callee refusing his call. Perhaps a new response code (4xx Unsecure 
transport not allowed) would be better.

Perhaps a caller preference should be defined to request such behavior, 
similar to "fork" and "no-fork" (RFC3841). Say "no-sips-sip"

Actually, 416 would achieve what you want.
302 would not be backward compatible because some proxy somewhere could
recurse on it, resulting in a downgrade.

If people prefer a 416, I can put that.=20

I do personaly prefer the 403, because I'd like to avoid any thing that
would cause a proxy to "automatically" recurse, thereby resulting
in a downgrade.

Hi Robert,

I understand what you are saying. And you are right: my point about
Third=20
party registration was a red herring: it's really the Contact being=20
different than the source of the REGISTER that is a problem).

But frankly, the transport parameter in general IMHO is a problem. The
fact that SIP isn't layered properly on top of TCP (or UDP) is the=20
issue frankly.

In a world where there are no NATs, no FW and every Joe has it's own
user certificate, we could make the transport parameter work.

If we re-introduce transport=3Dtls, then we'll have to explain when it
will
work. We will have to write big caveats that it won't work unless you
have no NAT, no Firewall, and you are using Mutual-TLS with User=20
certificates for the UAs. In general, it won't work.

In my mind, we would be doing a disservice to the industry by writing
protocol to do something that almost never works. The "But I can do it=20
today in the field (but just for TCP)" doesn't hold water, because TLS
is not TCP.=20

Furthermore, this "transport=3Dtls" stuff is not documented anywhere in
any RFC. So we would be writing from scratch broken procedures to
"document" broken practices in the field. Seems insane to me.=20

The clear and compelling reason to not use "transport=3Dtls" is that it
won't generally work, except for very contrived scenarios.

PS: "Transport=3Dtls" was "deprecated" in RFC 3261, but it didn't exist=20
     either in its predecessor RFC 2543. It was only defined in the
     the draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00. So the implementations that use
     it today do not conform to any RCF, obsolete or otherwise.

I agree with the last point, but does everybody agree?
I would really like to know because this exactly the type of scenario I 
would like to see clarified in draft-froment-sip-record-route-fix-00...

I rather think it makes perfect sense. With sip-outbound we have what in 
practical terms are two different SIP interfaces already; a 
client-server interface for UAs that REGISTER to the domain, and a 
server-server interface for outside-in traffic like INVITEs from other 
UAs (read: servers by whom other UAs send their sip-identity signed 
traffic).

A standard mechanism to configure the UAs of your domain to use 
_sip._tcp.client-interface.example.com, while the rest of the world uses 
  _sip._tcp.server-interface.example.com.

Cheers,

i don't get this.  the domain of SIP UAs' SIP uris is example.com for
which the queries are done, not something else.  clients would need to
prefix that with _sip-client and servers with _sip-server.  currently
there is no standard for that.

So I understand your position on how this affects devices we expect to
be behind transport-destroying elements and that we don't expect to
generally have certificates.

What about the proxy->proxy (or some stable network server) hop, where
we expect there _isn't_ a transport-destroying intermediary (hah) and  
that
we expect they _do_ have certificates? This is the case where I think we
have a real constituency (with real applications) that we're harming.

Consider the routing decision that P1 needs to make. The tools we have
allow P1 to choose among the protocols it knows how to use by  
administrative
configuration. They let P2 express policy about which protocols P1  
should use
(through DNS). What they don't do is let P1 choose between protocols  
based
on a user's (or application's) input.

We've got this concept of a location service that you access using  
REGISTER.
The spec talks about running it separately from a proxy - so consider  
the case
where  a proxy either does query REGISTERs or sends a request to a  
redirect
server to figure out where it's supposed to go. What it gets back is  
URIs in
Contact header fields. How can the location service tell the proxy  
that's asking
for a routing decision that "for this input URI, goto this output URI  
and use TLS"?

When you say "clients" and "servers", do you mean UACs and UASs, or some
other use of the words?

client is sip ua and server is a sip proxy.  see sections 14.3 and 14.4
of rfc 3920.

I can add even more complications (even though it seems complicated
enough, but what the heck).
What if we want to specify the encryption level (e.g. 40 bits or 128
bits)? What if we want to specify IPSec?

It seems to me that transport=3Dtls in the request URI causes a lot of
historical issues. Maybe there is a need for a feature tag/header that
defines the allowed secure methods for examples:
Unencrypted, tls, ipsec
The proxy would then be free to do whatever lookup method it wants (via
DNS, according to outbound or any policy) and it will forward the
request only if there is an option within one of the possible values it
received on the request.

Just a thought, I hope it helps.

Juha,

In that case "example.com" would be the server interface (and configured as 
such in DNS SRV). Clients would be given "x.example.com", where x can be 
anything you like (or "x.y.z", as long as you control the y.z domain in DNS 
SRV)

It's not exactly the same as for XMPP, where you say each element uses a 
prefix based on its role. But it would have a similar effect of separating 
preferred protocols (and other SRV attributes) per client 
(registration/outbound) versus other elements (e.g. proxies)

Regards,
Jeroen

jeroen,

clients are existing standard sip clients that not given anything else
but aor, username and password.  then they automatically make srv query
on example.com, not on x.example.com.  

of course by manual configuration of outbound proxy you can accomplish
whatever, but that is not what users want.  they want as little
configuration as possible and configuring outbound proxy manually is out
of question.

Hi Robert, yes, I think it is a good summary.

I'm not sure that we are "harming" anything by not having =
transport=3Dtls
because P1 can use static configuration or DNS to determine
the transport to use between P1 and P2.

The only thing that not having a transport=3Dtls parameter implies is
that P1 (as you put it) will not be able to determine that TLS
should be used between P1 and P2 based on User (UAC) input (on that
hop only).

Transport=3Dtls would allow the user to insist on the transport being
tls for the last hop before the target domain (but says nothing
about other hops).

I'm still not convinced that this particular behavior is required or
even=20
desired. Remember that the UAC does have the means to enforce TLS
accross
ALL the hops using SIPS.=20

Nevertheless, if people want to re-instate transport=3Dtls, we can do
it. It would have to include lots of text to explain the limitations,
but
it can certainly be done.

Yes, that is certainly a more concrete use case. Both for=20
the location service you mention, or for redirect servers in
general (when used for routing).

This may be the main technical reason for re-instating transport=3Dtls.
I'd be willing to go along with that.

There is also another reason, this time practical, for re-instating
transport=3Dtls. It is the fact that most implementations that support
TLS today seem to use it. I've attempted to mitigate this problem in
the current draft by writing up rules on how to deal with =
transport=3Dtls
in a backward compatible way, but I'm not convinced that it's enough.
Perhaps formally recognizing transport=3Dtls, and describing it's
limitations
(e.g., it doesn't solve NAT/FW, doesn't work with server-provided certs,
etc.).

Let's wait to see if anybody else chimes in on the idea of re-instating
transport=3Dtls.

This document defines requirements for adding certificate

   authentication to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This

   document is being presented with the intention of providing clear

   requirements to any potential solutions specifying certificate

   authentication within SIP networks.  Supporting certificate

   authentication in SIP would provide strong authentication and

   increase the types of possible deployment scenarios.

Eric, thank you for the comments and sorry for the slow response.

As you stated this was a first draft solution based on
draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth. We have since updated the
requirements draft to -03 which can be found at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-03
.txt.

The reasoning behind choosing a challenge/response paradigm is that is
the current model used in SIP, and allows a registrar to control when
and if to authenticate UAs. S/MIME could be a potential mechanism, as
could Identity or AIB in theory. At a high-level we weren't as concerned
with the actual mechanism as the signaling and messaging, since the
signing of some set of data seems to be similar across all the current
solutions. What we seem to be missing is the signaling and messaging to
use certificates for authenticating to a registrar/network or another
UA. Without challenge/response, the UA would always need to do
cryptographic processing and messages are larger, whether or not the
other end is requiring authentication. For UA to UA authentication, the
issue is even more of a concern, as we don't want UAs assuming
authentication of every dialog request.

Is it a fair statement that S/MIME/AIB/Identity all use similar
cryptographic tools but vary in the specific data from the dialog chosen
to sign?=20

Is there any preference to which "mechanism" is used for the solution?

Do all the solutions have issues with middleboxes?

Thanks.

Steve.

$Id: draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-sol-00-rev.txt,v 1.1 2007/03/10
21:13:10 ekr Exp $

The native SIP authentication scheme is Digest authentication.  This
draft and its companion draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth argue that it
is desirable to have an authentication scheme based on public key
certificates that can span multiple hops (TLS client auth lets you
authenticate to the first hop proxy). To some extent, SIP already has
such a scheme: messages can be S/MIME signed. As I understand it, the
primary deficiencies claimed for S/MIME are:

- There is no way for the server to indicate he wants you to
  S/MIME sign.
- There is no built-in defense against replay attacks.

In order to correct this situation, this draft proposes an extension to
HTTP Digest to add a signature mode.  I'm not sure how important this
problem actually is, but I'm skeptical that this draft is the best way
to go about it.

It seems to me that this proposal confuses two issues:

1. The formatting of the signature over the data.
2. How the server indicates that it wants a signature.

This proposal addresses both, but its solution to (1) is clumsy and
replicates functionality we already have, namely S/MIME.
It's fine to define a new form of authentication challenge that says
"please sign with your S/MIME cert" and even have it include a nonce,
but there's no need to model the response on Digest auth.
You can simply include the challenge in the material you sign over.

Incidentally, I've heard people argue that it would be nice to have a
generic solution for both HTTP and SIP. This problem has already been
attacked for HTTP (though with minimal adoption). See S-HTTP (RFC 2660).

To me, the way it should work is that TLS would be used if the returned URI 
was a "sips:" URI, or if the returned URI was a "sip:" URI and the proxy 
decides to upgrade it to "sips:" (i.e. due to local policy). I don't see the 
need for transport=tls in this case

Jeroen

Francois,

Refer to RFC3261 16.5: if a proxy is not responsible for the request URI it 
MUST NOT recurse on 302

416 does not have the right semantics (since the endpoint may in fact 
support sips, proxies currently should never generate this response) and 
RFC3261 section 16.7 step 4 says that a proxy responsible for the URI should 
recurse on it (should only happen in call forwarding scenarios, but still)

Lots of other error responses would prevent automatic recursion, but that 
does not make them any more suitable than 403 (which is not suitable either, 
IMHO)

If you really want to be on the safe side, a new 4xx response code would be 
best

Regards,
Jeroen

Jumping in. I just happened to pick Gilad's message to respond to.

I've only been loosely following this discussion. But it seems to me 
that this transport=tls issue is a distraction from finishing the sips 
draft. Why does the sips draft have any responsibility for addressing 
this issue?

I think it would be better to let the sips draft be finished and then 
move on to addressing all of the (many) important security issues that 
sips doesn't solve, as a separate effort.

Normally, I would agree with you. But transport=3Dtls is so=20
intertwined with SIPS that I'd rather fix both at the same time.

What I haven't heard is any voice strongly being against the=20

care anymore: just want to move on).

What we really need is a 302 that prohibits proxy recursion.

I am strongly against it. If there are any issues that are currently being 
solved using transport=tls (in practice), they should be solved in a 
different way.

How about:

It always tries TLS first, and if that doesn't work it either 1) falls
back to something else or 2) gives up. The choice between 1 and 2 is
made based on local policy.

Most clients are configurable with AOR, default proxy, username, and
password. If they aren't configurable with this, they're broken, they've
always been broken, and you need new ones. Even web browsers can be
configured to use a proxy that is not related to the user's AOR.

Examples of clients configurable this way include my ancient 3Com phone,
ancient Pingtel phone, every version of a Cisco 79xx phone I can
remember using over the last seven years, Linksys PAP2, Linksys RTP31, etc.

Some phones even learn their default proxies via DHCP.

So to do what you want to do, configure two sets of SRV records, one
that will be exercised by phones as "default proxies" and one that
corresponds to the domain part of your AORs.

yes, clients are configurable, but if sip is trying to compete with
spype, xmpp, etc., configuration required by user must be minimal,
nothing in addition to aor, username and password.  all the rest must be
automatically learned from the network.

looks like you have lost totally touch of the real world, if you think
that it is feasible to ask users to manually configure outbound proxies.

I tried to develop my point a little further.

I think there should be a way for the UA to specify the means of
communication. If we support transport=3Dtls it resembles a little to =
the
transport parameter in the Via header. This is good as long as there
single preference. This is always the case in Via header, but the
transport parameter is not good enough in the following cases:
* Registrations where outbound is not used and user has more than one
preference on transport/security attributes.
* Outgoing communication and the user has more than one preference on
security attributes.

(There are probably other cases which I'm not aware of)

These preferences have some relationship with the transport. A UA might
want to indicate it supports TLS over TCP and not TLS over SCTP.

I think SIPS means - I want to communicate, possibly via trusted
proxies, in a manner that a third-party would not be able to intercept
or modify. If this definition is acceptable it does not rule out IPSec,
despite being out of RFC 3261 scope (I'll open a different thread on
that). My point is that this is also part of the possible preferences. A
UA might indicate that it can communicate either in IPSec or TLS. In the
transport parameter syntax the only option would be a single value such
as "transport=3Dipsec-udp".

Furthermore a UA might want to indicate it wants higher grade of
security 128 and not 40 bits.

I think the draft clarifies well the relationship between SIP and SIPS.
If there is a need to handle the cases above, it should be done by other
means.

Bottom line is that it's likely we'll regret allowing the use of
transport=3Dtls. From my understanding the draft tries to add backward
compatibility and does not endorse it.

Hi Dean,

I have seen that the draft defines the relationship between SIP and SIPS
and indicates that "A SIPS URI specifies that the resource be contacted
securely."

I believe that IPSec can also achieve the same goal in terms of
security. My question is shouldn't this specification define this as an
acceptable possibility.

If 2 proxies have an IPSec tunnel between them, I believe it is
acceptable that they would pass SIPS communication just like TLS
communication. Naturally IPSec can also be used to pass SIP
communication. Basically almost any rule that applies to TLS in the SIPS
context, applies to IPSec.
The reason I think this is required is the fact that there are SIP and
IPSec implementations and SIPS is not defined for these cases.

If this is accepted, it would mean the draft should indicate "secure
transport" instead of "TLS" (except where TLS is specifically
discussed).

Regards,
Gilad

FWIW, and for the record, I am also against the re-instatement of
"transport=tls" for much the same reasons that you had mentioned
in a previous email (c.f. 
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg19371.html).
Plus, now that TLS is supported over other transports, we will
need to indicate the transport in the parameter as well.

My former employers shipped something like 50 million "configurable" SIP
devices to the real world, and email and http clients require comparable
configuration.

I also know that at many places one has to manually configure something
like a SOCKs proxy to make XMPP work.

The human-controlled policies around network operations require systems
to act in more complex ways than protocols can optimally support. This
isn't the protocol's fault.

I initially supported this position, but the WG has stepped back from it
FOR THIS DRAFT in the interest of making SIPS as meaningful as we can
without heavy modification to the protocol (and with some realization
that SIPS alone doesn't mean all that much).

Your suggestion is slipping into "futures" work problems, much like the
cypher-suites draft.

i agree that there are always cases where auto-configuration does not
work, but it should be the default.  auto-learning of outbound proxies
should be a very basic requirement of outbound, but last time i checked,
no mechanism was included.  i suggest that a similar mechanism that
xmpp has, will be added.

So does anybody besides the authors care, or is this work just so far  
ahead of the mainstream working group that we need to move the work  
to a lower priority queue?

I had read and commented on earlier revision of this work; have
not had the chance to see -02 yet.

So, to be pedantic about a three questions in your short
paragraph above:

1) Does anybody besides the authors care?  Yes.
2) Is this work so far ahed of the mainstream working group?
  Given that we are fighting sips, transport=tls, SRV RR, MIME,
  and SDP rules battles in the last couple of weeks, I would
  say yes.
3) Do we need to move the work to a lower priority queue?  I
  will leave that in the capable hands of Messers Willis and Drage

Sounds appealing, until you realize that in an environment where TLS
support is the
exception and not the norm, you would degrade the performance of the
network
significantly by having lots of failed TLS connection attemps.

Actually, now that I think of it, it may not be as bad as I tought.

If UAs are using sip-outbound with their proxies, it would handle the
vast majority of the links.

Between proxies, you would use DNS or static configuration normally.

Furthermore, between proxies, re-using of existing TCP/TLS may also be
done.

So maybe you are right.

I think many of the assumptions we've been making seem to indicate  
that if you just don't know, the only reasonable thing to do is try  
TLS first. If there's nobody listening on the TLS port (but somebody  
at the IP address), you should get an ICMP response pretty quickly  
anyhow, then be able to decide on fallback.

If we hold the opposite true, and we try plain SIP/UDP first and only  
move to TLS when plain SIP fails, we're going to be in for a world of  
delay-hurt (waiting for that plain SIP/UDP transaction to time out)  
and never opportunistically using TLS anyhow.

Of course, it's better if you "know" up front, which is part of what  
the argument in favor of transport=tls is asking for. But given that  
we have ways for knowing in many of the other cases, this may not be  
critical.

Of course, if we'd started with a plain connection, discovered TLS  
capability in a greeting message (aka EHELO) and then done an upgrade  
to that connection using something like STARTTLS, we wouldn't be  
having this discussion. It would have just worked. Boy do I feel dumb.

Hi Steve,

I tried to understand how the modified digest algorithm
in your draft works and I have to admit I have difficulties
on digesting it.

First of all your draft tells that the UA should create
the request-digest as follows:

   Once the data string is formed, it MUST be hashed and signed with
   private key of the client.  The algorithm used for hashing and
   signing is specified in the WWW-Authenticate header.

To verify the received request-digest the server should then
do this:

   6.  The server authenticates the client by generating its own
       challenge response using the server and client generated data and
       compares its result with that sent in the challenge response by
       the client.  If the two match, the client has been authenticated.

and:

   the server must perform the same cryptographic operation performed by
   the client, and compare the result to the response provided by the
   client.

But how can the server perform the same cryptograpic operation as
the client ? Only the client knows its private key used for creating
request-digest while the server knows only the public key of the user.
The method that you are suggesting would work if there is a shared
secret like in RFC 2617 for HTTP Digest but this is not the case
for using PKI certificates.

If I have understood it correctly how the digital signatures are
used the process should instead go like this:

1. The UA creates a hash of the SIP request and the nonce
2. The UA encrypts the resulting hash with its private key
   and sends this digital signature along with the SIP request

3. The server also creates a hash of the SIP request and the nonce
4. The server decrypts the encrypted string with the public
   key and compares the result to the hash it created in step 3.

Please tell if you think I have misunderstood any of this.


I did not find the draft to describe very clearly how the digital
signing with the private key is performed and which algorithms are
used in different phases of the process. Thus my further questions=20
are related to the hashing functions introduced in your draft:

   this document, in order to remain consistent with RFC 2617, the
   string obtained by applying the algorithm to the data "data" will be
   denoted by KD(data)and the string obtained by applying the hash
   algorithm to the data "data" will be denoted H(data).

   The algorithm used for hashing and
   signing is specified in the WWW-Authenticate header.  This document
   defines only one "algorithm" value: 'rsa-sha1'

Does this mean that rsa-sha1 is used for both H(data) and KD(data) ?
If yes, what is then the difference between functions H and KD ?
Or is H(data) supposed to use MD5 instead of rsa-sha1 ?=20

Is usage of the private key somehow embedded into your definition=20
of KD(data) or is signing applied to the hashed string that is received
as a result from KD(data) ?

Regards,

Erkki

Probably there are other more important topics. In general, we should 
give higher priority to fixing the current protocol than adding new 
functionality, but this does not advocate for stopping progressing new 
functions until the protocol is totally fixed.

Hi,

I have also read the draft and to me it seems to be in a
rather good shape. It is worth checking whether the spec
could even be completed soon, instead of letting it just to
wait for better times to appear.

Regards,

Erkki

Hi Steve,

I tried to understand how the modified digest algorithm in your draft
works and I have to admit I have difficulties on digesting it.

First of all your draft tells that the UA should create the
request-digest as follows:

   Once the data string is formed, it MUST be hashed and signed with
   private key of the client.  The algorithm used for hashing and
   signing is specified in the WWW-Authenticate header.

To verify the received request-digest the server should then do this:

   6.  The server authenticates the client by generating its own
       challenge response using the server and client generated data and
       compares its result with that sent in the challenge response by
       the client.  If the two match, the client has been authenticated.

and:

   the server must perform the same cryptographic operation performed by
   the client, and compare the result to the response provided by the
   client.

But how can the server perform the same cryptograpic operation as the
client ? Only the client knows its private key used for creating
request-digest while the server knows only the public key of the user.
The method that you are suggesting would work if there is a shared
secret like in RFC 2617 for HTTP Digest but this is not the case for
using PKI certificates.

If I have understood it correctly how the digital signatures are used
the process should instead go like this:

1. The UA creates a hash of the SIP request and the nonce 2. The UA
encrypts the resulting hash with its private key
   and sends this digital signature along with the SIP request

3. The server also creates a hash of the SIP request and the nonce 4.
The server decrypts the encrypted string with the public
   key and compares the result to the hash it created in step 3.

Please tell if you think I have misunderstood any of this.

[SD] You are correct. This should be clarified.


I did not find the draft to describe very clearly how the digital
signing with the private key is performed and which algorithms are used
in different phases of the process. Thus my further questions are
related to the hashing functions introduced in your draft:

   this document, in order to remain consistent with RFC 2617, the
   string obtained by applying the algorithm to the data "data" will be
   denoted by KD(data)and the string obtained by applying the hash
   algorithm to the data "data" will be denoted H(data).

   The algorithm used for hashing and
   signing is specified in the WWW-Authenticate header.  This document
   defines only one "algorithm" value: 'rsa-sha1'

Does this mean that rsa-sha1 is used for both H(data) and KD(data) ?
If yes, what is then the difference between functions H and KD ?
Or is H(data) supposed to use MD5 instead of rsa-sha1 ?=20

Is usage of the private key somehow embedded into your definition of
KD(data) or is signing applied to the hashed string that is received as
a result from KD(data) ?

[SD] It appears the H(data) is unnecessary, KD could denote the hashing
and encrypting (signing) of the string of data. I was attempting to work
within the constraints of Digest's current procedures and call flows
while re-using some existing concepts from Identity/AIB/etc. It would be
helpful to get your feedback on the concept itself, whether you see
challenge/response as the appropriate paradigm, and whether we should
attempt to reuse existing mechanisms such as S/MIME, as there have been
different views on these topics.

Per other responses, there are people that care about this work.  But,
unfortunately, it is a bit ahead of the mainstream. However, I think it
is important and I would hate to see it linger forever in the WG (it has
already been around for a while). How far is it from being done?=20

It most certainly does not say that.

Perhaps you are referring to this text:

  A proxy MUST NOT add additional targets to the target set if the
    Request-URI of the original request does not indicate a resource this
    proxy is responsible for.

This is referring to the R-URI in the original INVITE, not the one in 
the contact in the 3xx.

WHy is that? Section 21.4.14 says nothing about UA vs. proxies. It talks 
about servers. I think 416 is not far off.

However to be honest we need to explicitly indicate that the problem was 
sips-to-sip so that the original UA can decide whether to retry. Thus 
I'd suggest a new 4xx code.

What do you mean by 'information related to the session usage'?

I'll also take this opportunity to remind people of the reasons I think 
moving forward with more INFO usages is a bad idea:

We had implementation work going on (to determine whether things work as 
expected) and investigated different applications in more detail (as 
published in separate drafts).

So, what is missing? We have an issue tracker that contains the open 
issues:
http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/index

I will address some (if not all) of them with the next draft update. 
Planned in about 2 weeks from now.

Ciao
Hannes

Sorry for the (really) long delay here in responding.

Since this UA is, in fact, a single instance, there would only be one 
public GRUU. When receiving a request targeted to the GRUU, the home 
proxy would populate the target set with the two contacts bound to the 
associated instance ID/AOR combo, and then follow regular sip-outbound 
rules for routing the request.

It would not be appropriate to include the reg-id as part of the GRUU.

Based on the GRUU spec, it would. I believe that the UA has to use the 
same Call-ID for both reg-id.

Well, it should be different no matter what. The registrar is supposed 
to generate a new temporary GRUU on every register.

Yes.

I'm fine with this.


Let me propose 418 (SIPS Not Allowed)

With the following description:

	The server cannot process the request because the SIPS scheme is
not=20
	allowed. The UAC SHOULD retry the request, this time, using a
SIP URI.
	This response differs from 416 in that the server recognizes the
SIPS
	URI, but it is not allowed (e.g., because the UAS registered
with
	a SIP Contact header field).

(And the current text on proxies not recursing on this will apply)

(Note: existing implementations will treat it as 400, which is intended=20
behavior, i.e., it will not automatically re-attempt anything).

If you support this, or are against this, please voice your opinion. If
you don't=20
care that much, just don't say anything :^)

Now, the next logical quesiton is for sip-to-sips.

Currently, the text has this text about proxies that may decide to use
either 403 or 3XX to redirect to a SIPS URI. We have a similar problem
here
that some proxy in the middle may decide to recurse on it (which would
break
the last hop upgrade prohibition).

Do we need a 419 (SIPS Required) as well? Or are we happy with the
current text?

Jonathan,

Yes, that is the text I was refering to. As a consequence of that a proxy 
MUST NOT recurse on 302 if not responsible for the request URI (but this 
text is not literally in RFC3261). Still, a 302 sent by the callee's proxy 
could result in recursion in case of call forwarding scenarios, so 
conclusion remains that a new 4xx is better

Regards,
Jeroen

Well, given there are still deployments with Remote-Party-ID, who have 
yet to migrate to P-Asserted-ID, let alone SIP identity, I'd say it is a 
  bit ahead of the curve. That said I do think its worth doing, but is 
not  a high priority.

RLBob Morgan buttonholed myself and Keith D. (at least) in hallway in San Diego 
  (I believe) and indicated that they (Internet2 Mace, UWash) want to 
implement/use the spec and was curious wrt what it would take to "finish" it.

That said, as Hannes indicated, we'll endeavor to have another rev out, 
addressing more of the issues listed in the tracker, sooner rather than later.

thanks,

 I agree as others have mentioned that there are items that are of
higher priority(bug fixes etc.), but having followed the draft from its 
early stage,
much effort has gone into the draft and should be in a fairly good shape if
issues raised in the last few IETFs are well addressed. If the draft is 
well
baked I see no reason to lower its priority (Assuming the work is nearly
done and wouldn't take the resource from more important work that are 
needed
urgently).

 That being said, it may be good to recruit some reviewers and analyze
where the draft is with its maturity and decide its fate.

Ugh - that's what the parenthetical below way trying to talk about.
Stuff like digits in INFO (which we say should be done with KPML  
instead).
Stuff like capturing data out of a protocol on the other side of a  
gateway an tunneling it to
either an application or to another gateway.
Stuff like data out of the media channel (collected an an IVR  
perhaps) that needs to be passed
to an application server that's not on the media path.
More stuff than I think it will be worth trying to build clarity  
around for this conversation.

My point was to _agree_ with what's in sip-info-harmful (you see that  
Dean also called that out early in the thread)
and to note that we don't have the reasoning that's there stated  
strongly enough in an easy to stumble across place
and without that, people are going to continue to find new ways to  
fill the tubes with INFO requests.
(We need _more_ than just what's in your draft - we also need  
guidance for people who are wanting to do new
things with INFO that points them to what we consider sane  
alternatives instead.)

I haven't built myself any strong opinion on the usefulness of
the ability for the UA/user to authenticate by using certificates
issued by a CA or the various mechanism how to do that.

In overall it seems that in most of the deployments the
SIP devices or users do not have PKI certificates for=20
themselves. So the concept seems to apply only to a few
specific deployments only (I do not have any idea how big
those deployments could be).

What comes to the mechanism, I would tend to agree with
Eric's analysis:

>>primary deficiencies claimed for S/MIME are:
>>
>>- There is no way for the server to indicate he wants you to

>>- There is no built-in defense against replay attacks.

These properties suggest using a challenge-response scheme
where the server can decide when to challenge and at that
moment give a random nonce for the client to use.

I think that reusing existing mechanisms (like S/MIME)
makes sense in certain respect to decrease the needed
specification effort.

However the S/MIME approach is also suffers from a few=20
problems:

- S/MIME is not widely implemented for SIP, so there is
  no great reuse expected for existing implementations.
  Even the basic (multipart) MIME support is lacking
  from most of the SIP devices and effort has recently
  been started in SIP WG to specify how those devices
  should use MIME bodies. Thus I do not believe S/MIME
  to be an existing and deployed mechanism for SIP which
  could be easily reused for this purpose.

- Tunneling SIP bodies over S/MIME would easily duplicate
  the size of the message. This does not only take some
  bandwidth but would typically force the UA to switch
  its transport to TCP, which again have some issues
  for deployments based on UDP (as was discussed in a
  different thread for SIP Outbound).

I have not had a look into this, but perhaps it would be
worth for you to investigate:

Extending the digest authentication framework with new
schemes (like for PKI certificates) is not impossible as
proven by RFC 3310 for digest AKA, but getting all details
right would require the spec to be written very carefully.

Hi Steve,

One more thing for you to think just in case you=20
will continue with your effort of extending the
digest framework for this:

>Is usage of the private key somehow embedded into your definition of
>KD(data) or is signing applied to the hashed string that is received as
>a result from KD(data) ?
>
>[SD] It appears the H(data) is unnecessary, KD could denote the hashing
>and encrypting (signing) of the string of data.

I believe that you have to separate the steps of (a) hashing
and (b) encrypting the hash like suggested in my comment:

>the process should instead go like this:
>
>1. The UA creates a hash of the SIP request and the nonce=20
>2. The UA encrypts the resulting hash with its private key
>   and sends this digital signature along with the SIP request
>
>3. The server also creates a hash of the SIP request and the nonce=20
>4. The server decrypts the encrypted string with the public
>   key and compares the result to the hash it created in step 3.

Thus you probably need to define two functions:

a) One for creating the hash from the SIP request. This=20
   function does not use any secret or public key. Most
   probably the parts of the request to be hashed are as
   specified in AIB RFC 3893.

b) Another for creating the digital signature over the hash.
   This function takes as its input the hash from the previous
   step and the private key related to user's certificate.

These two functions could use different hash functions,
so you have to specify both.

P.S. Please do not believe me to be an experienced
security expert, I am just in process of learning
cryptography by myself.

Regards,

Erkki

All,

There is a single open issue in 
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt

It relates to handling of list subscriptions. Specifically, what 
approach should we take in defining how conditional notification works 
in RLSs?  Seems there are roughly four different approaches:

    1.  Treat meta-information as independent of the actual resource
        state, don't apply conditional notification to meta-information
        at all.

    2.  Treat everything as a single resource, and update the etag
        whenever either meta or real info changes.

    3.  Have separate etags for meta and real information.

    4.  Ignore the issue.

If we think this is an issue this draft should address, then my 
preference would be to option #2. Otherwise, #4 would be the easiest 
given this issue is really specific to one event type only, and can be 
solved separately if needed.

Opinions?

If I don't hear anything from anyone, I guess I'll have to flip a coin 
to determine between #2 and #4. ;-)

Cheers,
Aki

I have been looking at RFC3515 and have found the following:

Section 2.2 contains the table of headers supported in the REFER method
and contains the following:

      Header                    Where   REFER
      ...
      Expires                     R       o

Section 2.4.4 "Using SIP Events to Report the Results of the Reference"
contains the following paragraph:

   Notice that unlike SUBSCRIBE, the REFER transaction does not contain
   a duration for the subscription in either the request or the
   response.  The lifetime of the state being subscribed to is
   determined by the progress of the referenced request.  The duration
   of the subscription is chosen by the agent accepting the REFER and is
   communicated to the agent sending the REFER in the subscription's
   initial NOTIFY (using the Subscription-State expires header
   parameter).  Note that agents accepting REFER and not wishing to hold
   subscription state can terminate the subscription with this initial
   NOTIFY.

Which part of the RFC is correct ?

What happens if a REFER does contain an Expires header ?=20

Should the Expire duration included in the REFER be used in preference
to the time which would be allocated by the agent receiving the REFER as
described in 2.4.4 ?

If the Expire duration is "0" is this equivalent to using the Refer-sub
header being set to false ?=20

Hi Ian,

=20

Here is something, a bit old, but might hint an answer:

http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg01917.html

=20

Based on that and section 2.4.4, I would say that the intent was to give
no meaning to Expires in REFER. Section 2.2 might be something no one
noticed until now.

Two separate issues, both important...

Jonathan may remember that I asked about his draft in discussions about the 
hitchhiker's guide. The answsr was, of course, that we didn't have a 
reasonable reference to the draft, so couldn't tell people who were trying 
to learn about SIP "don't go there" (until, of course, they "go there" and 
submit draft-newbie-sip-whatever-over-info-00).

So at the very least, we need an RFC number that's not in the draft now!

It would be OK with me if we ALSO had this type of guidance ("don't look 
HERE, look over THERE") available ("stated strongly enough in an easy to 
stumble across place"), but if coming up with that guidance takes more than 
about a week, I don't see a lot of reason to hold up on "don't go there" 
while we explore alternatives.

<rant>If we don't progress stuff like this, we can't be surprised when the 
experts spend all their time explaining the same stuff over and over again, 
onlist. New participants don't want to repeat old bad ideas. They have 
plenty of opportunities to come up with NEW bad ideas. This is a SIP 
community responsibility, not just Jonathan's and not just the chairs' 
responsibility. Jonathan did his part (in 2003), and Dean points to this 
draft about once a month. We need to find a way to move past 
lather-rinse-repeat about long-time semi-documented consensus.

IMO. Of course.

</rant>

Hi,

People are implementing INFO usages WITHOUT submitting =
draft-newbie-sip-whatever-over-info-00.

And, when looking at which companies are doing it, it can be discussed =
whether all of them can be considered being "SIP newbies"... But, that's =
another issue.

Regards,

Christer

I think that we should address the issue. Either 2 or 3 will be good
but 2 will be much more simpler.

[Sip] Open issue in subnot etags






All,

There is a single open issue in 
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt

It relates to handling of list subscriptions. Specifically, what 
approach should we take in defining how conditional notification works 
in RLSs?  Seems there are roughly four different approaches:

    1.  Treat meta-information as independent of the actual resource
        state, don't apply conditional notification to meta-information
        at all.

    2.  Treat everything as a single resource, and update the etag
        whenever either meta or real info changes.

    3.  Have separate etags for meta and real information.

    4.  Ignore the issue.

If we think this is an issue this draft should address, then my 
preference would be to option #2. Otherwise, #4 would be the easiest 
given this issue is really specific to one event type only, and can be 
solved separately if needed.

Opinions?

If I don't hear anything from anyone, I guess I'll have to flip a coin 
to determine between #2 and #4. ;-)

Cheers,
Aki

Many people are still under the impression that DTMF should/can be done =
with INFO.
For example: http://www.vonage-forum.com/ftopic5305.html
I'm not even sure how many people are aware of RFC 4730 as it's quite =
new. However, RFC 4730 does not explain why DTMF should be done by event =
notification rather than INFO. This feature was missing for a long time =
in SIP so many implementations already have INFO with DTMF (I won't =
provide links for that, but it's easy to find via any popular search =
engine).

I also seem to remember a company, with a lot of experience with SIP =
that offered a few years ago to do floor control with INFO. Basically =
anyone who wants to do something proprietary without thinking about it =
too much will go for INFO. Since RFC 3265 came out things have improved =
because many realize event packages are a better solution. However, INFO =
is still considered a viable candidate for many of these solutions =
because it seems as an option SIP provides and perhaps even endorses. I =
assume it's because the INFO concept is very simple.

Unfortunately INFO is required for SIP-T, therefore there is a valid =
usage.

The options I see are:
1. Provide BCP (or WCP as stated below) for INFO.
2. Deprecate the current RFC and define INFO for SIP-T only.
3. Find another solution for SIP-T and wipe out INFO from SIP.
4. Find more cases that mandate INFO (are there any?) and redefine its =
scope.

Hi;
Don't forget that most Media Servers Control protocols
use SIP info to carry their XML payload to control the media server.

  <br>
It relates to handling of list subscriptions. Specifically, what <br>
approach should we take in defining how conditional notification works
  <br>
in RLSs? &nbsp;Seems there are roughly four different approaches:<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;1. &nbsp;Treat meta-information as independent of the actual
resource<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;state, don't apply conditional notification
to meta-information<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at all.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;2. &nbsp;Treat everything as a single resource, and update
the etag<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whenever either meta or real info changes.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp;Have separate etags for meta and real information.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;4. &nbsp;Ignore the issue.<br>
  <br>
If we think this is an issue this draft should address, then my <br>
preference would be to option #2. Otherwise, #4 would be the easiest <br>
given this issue is really specific to one event type only, and can be
  <br>
solved separately if needed.<br>
  <br>
Opinions?<br>
  <br>
If I don't hear anything from anyone, I guess I'll have to flip a coin
  <br>
to determine between #2 and #4. ;-)<br>

Hi, Robert,

> info-harmful forward until
> we had better answers or not - I wasn't.

My bad. It wasn't obvious to me from your otherwise-excellent note whether 
you were thinking of two separate documents.

I just wanted to make sure we would do something soon (at least measured in 
IETF years). Given that saying "don't go there" has taken four years since 
Jonathan's last update, I was concerned that saying "don't look here, look 
over there" would take more time than I was willing to spend continuing to 
point to an expired draft.

I have pointed this out previously in private e-mail, but 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-melanchuk-mediactrl-framework-00.txt 
is having to put forward its own analysis of "why not INFO" in Section 5 
("SIP Usage"), because Tim doesn't have anything we can refer to except an 
expired individual draft. I'd rather rely on a document done here than text 
in the MEDIACTRL framework document, just because I think the larger SIP 
community would look at text done here more closely than in a MEDIACTRL 
draft.

IMO, of course.

> I'm saying we aren't done  just by moving it forward.

Ack.

Double Ack.

Thanks for clarifying (so that I'm now clear :-).

Spencer

Based on the feedback from the mailing list from the last few days,=20
I'm proposing the following:

- That we do not re-instate "transport=3Dtls" at this point (i.e., in=20
  the draft-ietf-sip-sips draft).

- As suggested by Paul Kyzivat, we would defer any work on =
transport=3Dtls
  to later. As such, we would add this topic in Annex A "Future Steps in
  Specification". We would describe the uses cases that are currently
  not covered by this draft: URIs that need to specify TLS as a
transport,
  as per the Redirect server and Location server examples that were
described
  by Robert Sparks. =20

Schrodinger's cat is out of the bag and off eating mice somewhere.

SIP is a transport protocol. INFO is its freight carrier. People have  
used it and will use it in ways that make us queasy. The only thing  
to do is to produce some guidelines about documenting those "ways"  
and provide both registration and peer-negotiation for "ways" so that  
we don't have a meltdown. Much like we did for event packages.

I'll be assembling the draft agenda for our meetings in Chicago, so  
please send me requests for time on the agenda.

Note that we'll be first assigning time to chartered items that we're  
behind on, then to chartered items in general, then to stuff we've  
been talking about that's likely to be chartered or affect chartered  
work, and only after that to new work.

Since I don't expect to have a lot of time left over for new work, if  
you want agenda time, please make sure you have "critical mass" on- 
list before asking for meeting time. It'll keep me from having to say  
"no", which I always hate doing.

Further, please try and keep our valuable face-to-face time for  
dealing with contentious, complicated, controversial (or other things  
requiring face-to-face discussion) issues, and do the easy stuff "on  
list".

Thanks,

(As WG chair)

Well it seems there is interest in this work, but it is not getting the
attention it deserves.
=20
Some people also seem to think it is almost there, but we have no way of
judging that without seeing the what comments are being made against the
document (or of course reviewing it ourselves).

This week is a quiet week (we supposedly finished our current WGLC
yesterday, and we are not yet ready to initiate another one, and the
draft closured deadlines for the forthcoming IETF are still a little bit
away).
=20
We therefore task the working group to take the next 7 calendar days
(ending Monday 18th June) to open up:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt

And for everyone to post at least one comment on the document to the SIP
list. Posts can cover any of:

-	completeness - is there something missing?
-	applicability - does it identify and solve a problem?
-	readability - I didn't understand what it was trying to tell me?
-	correctness of technical solution - the solution is flawed?
-	nits

We would also welcome suggestions as to whether review is needed by
other groups than the SIP WG.

And of course if you read it and find it absolutely perfect, send the
chairs a mail at least to tell us.

Regards

Keith

I like the idea of being clear where SIP INFO belongs (arguably only for
use with SIP-T) and then having a BCP which identifies common places
where SIP INFO is being used today, and then references the preferred
practice (typically not using SIP INFO) or work in progress (for
example, the mediactrl work) which will result in new practices. =20

The problem from a manufacturer's standpoint is that customers have
existing products (for example, gateways) that use SIP INFO for DTMF
passage and they insist on having compatibility with these bad practices
built into other products, thus perpetuating the cycle of bad practice.
A BCP might at least point the preferred way out of this mess.  =20

Normally, when we produce BCP type of documents, it's because there is a
problem out there (people implement specs in different, uninteroperable,
ways etc).

Are we aware of real-life problems with using INFO for DTMF (or whatever
else it's used for)? People have been doing it for a while (if we wanted
to restrict something, it should have been done years ago...), it's
fairly simple to implement - and it seems to work.

The only problem is that much of the INFO usages are not defined in
RFCs, but that's not always the fault of the implementors...

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I did a review of this draft today and here are my comments to it:

>-	applicability - does it identify and solve a problem?

I believe it solves a relevant problem which was identified=20
already within RFC 4484.

>-	readability - I didn't understand what it was trying to tell me?

I found the draft easy to understand even if I had very little
knowledge on SAML itself when starting to read the draft some
time ago.

>-	correctness of technical solution - the solution is flawed?

The approach itself seems to be sound, but some details still
need polishing, like this one:

   10.  Verify that the SAML assertion contains an <Audience> element,
        and that its value matches the value of the addr-spec of the SIP
        To header field.

How is this matching to be done ? Shall the <Audience> element
exactly the SIP URI in the To header or can it contain just a
part of it (like host part of the URI) ? The example in section 8
is like this:

  19          <Audience>
   20             example2.com
   21          </Audience>

which is not a SIP URI, so I believe either the example or the
normative text needs clarification.


>-	completeness - is there something missing?

The draft refers to a number of open issues:

13.  Open Issues

   A list of open issues can be found at:
   http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/

It seems to me that those issues are still open within this
version of the draft and should be addressed. I became concerned
especially of issue 12 where there is an interoperability problem
if the UAS only supports Identity-Info to refer to a certificate
(per RFC 4474) instead of SAML assertion. This should be fixed in
some way or another.


    @@ TODO: do we need to define a new SIP error response code for
    when a SAML assn signature is bad? e.g., '4xx Invalid SAML
    asssertion'.

This TODO shall be resolved. To me an extra error code
would make sense.


>-	nits

I found these:

In section 6.1.2:

   Although this profile is overview is cast in terms of a SIP INVITE
   transaction

The first 'is' of the sentence sounds unnecessary.

   and also containing a the domain's (example.com) public key
certificate

The 'a' should be removed.


The SIP URIs in Figure 2 should be checked:
- Is Alice either Alice@example.com or alice@foo.com ?
- Is Bob either bob@example.com or bob@example2.com ?
- Should the SIP URIs of both Bob and Alice or neither
  of them have sip: prefix in the figure ? Currently
  Alice does not have it (in From) while Bob has (in To).


In section 9.1.=20

      *  etc.

This 'etc' should be removed.=20

Regards,

Erkki

Do we need DTMF via INFO for some kind of functionality KPML (or RFC
2833) does not provide? I'm not aware of such a case.


One description of a problem with INFO can be found in this historical
chat:
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sipping/current/msg04455.html

The explanation from the expired draft is as follows:

Under this proposal, a User Agent MUST NOT send signaled digits or
telephone-events using the INFO method if the event was ever represented
as a tone (as media). Only signals originated as pure signaling MAY
generate an INFO method. Failure to heed this requirement will result in
double-detection of digits/events.=20

If INFO is used incorrectly by a pair of PSTN gateways (for example),
the source gateway may detect a digit, send an INFO request which is
lost, and retransmit that request. The target gateway would send the
original in-band tone to the PSTN when the audio media arrives, later
when the INFO arrives, the target gateway would render the same tone
again. It is quite likely that the INFO will arrive after the media tone
has been played (especially if multiple intermediaries are involved);
the same digit would be played out again and this will frequently cause
systems in the PSTN to detect the same digit signaled twice.=20

I think the implementors knew this was not standard or at most in very
early draft mode when they implemented it.

Regarding 2833, I guess the main idea of sending DTMFs out-of-band (no
matter if you use INFO or something else) is when you send them to an
entity which does not have media access.

You can always mess up if you use things incorrectly. I don't think that
is INFO specific.

Hi,

Here is another major problem with INFO - there is no header that states
the purpose of INFO.
The event header in subscriptions helps identify an event package.
Therefore an implementation can easily detect if this event package is
supported or not. With INFO it is much harder to detect the purpose of
this INFO message. Currently AFAIK the content-type in INFO implicitly
denotes this.

If you are aiming towards a solution that keeps INFO for more usages, I
would say that we need to resolve this issue first.

I also think it would be a burden on implementors to do both KPML and
INFO. Wouldn't it be easier for the implementors that did INFO to switch
to KPML instead of the entire industry doing both?

You can state in the Accept header that you support the content-type for

INFO is very easy to implement. So I dont't see any problem to keep the 
INFO implementation
until KPML is adopted. Or maybe keep both.

Draft:  draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-01
Reviewer: Shida Schubert
Review Date: 11 June 2007
Review Deadline: 11 June 2007
Status: WGLC

I apologize for submitting the review past deadline.

Summary: This draft is basically ready for publication, but has nits 
and some clarification that should be fixed/added before publication. 

Comments:
----------
I reviewed the diff for this document as compared to the version 
I previously reviewed:

 I believe all my previous concerns have been addressed. I also 
re-read the document through which I found some areas that need some 
clarifications and additional nits/editorials.


Clarifications needed:
------
C1) Section 4.4.1, 2nd para, 2nd last sentence.
 - not receiving policy and not receiving any response the same thing?
   > If not may want to clarify this.
   
C2) Section 4.4.1  
 The token is mentioned everywhere, but looking at the event packages 
 there is no token defined. Do you expect token to be something implicit 
 that administrator somehow configures the policy server and UA so they 
 implicitly know what token is and how to find it in the policy provided 
 by the policy server? I understand that token itself may have flexibility 
 in its value, but where to look for the token SHOULD be specified explicitly.

C3) Section 4.4.1
 For existing dialog, what is the impact of policy channel failing?
  > Would it affect the whole dialog or just the usage?
  > Currently it reads like it would affect the dialog which may not 
    be desirable. (Section 4.4.6 reads "This means
   that, the UA MUST cancel or reject a pending INVITE transaction for
   the session or terminate the session if it is already in progress."

     e.g) UAC tries to change the codec mid-dialog 
          > sends the new SDP to policy server 
          > Policy server is offline or returns global class error
          > What happens now? 

C4) Section 4.4.2
 Proxy's behavior on policy-id and token is completely missing. 

 paragraph 2 notes how proxy MUST NOT reject the request if the 
 policy-id contains the associated policy server's URI but on section 
 4.4.1, there is enough text describing how some proxy may base their 
 pass-through on token, so I think text on proxy behavior surrounding 
 token in this section is an appropriate addition.

C5) Section 4.4.2
 It may be appropriate to add some text on RR by proxy wanting to 
 ensure UA passes the same proxies/policy servers, rather than UA 
 maintaining a list of policy servers to contact mid-dialog. UA 
 always contacting the same policy servers contacted at the initial 
 session setup, even after the signaling path has changed seems 
 unreasonable and ineffective.

 * I don't have a strong opinion on this, don't mind the current 
   spec but wondered if you considered this. 

C6) Section 4.4.3 
 As UAS does not use the policy-Id, text SHOULD be added to 
 mention that if the list of policy server changes in mid-dialog that 
 it should contact the policy servers again. (Text can be added 
 instead in section 4.4.5 - last paragraph encouraging the re-visit 
 to the policy servers)

 * This is not problematic with UAC as proxy would return 488 with 
   policy server URI, alerting the UAC that list of policy server 
   that need to be contacted have changed.




Nits/Editorials:
------
N1) Section 1, 1st para, 2nd sentence.
 [page mode messaging is not divorced from the actual session]

 OLD: However, proxies are divorced from the actual sessions - 
   audio, video, and messaging - that SIP establishes.
 
 NEW: However, proxies are divorced from the actual sessions - 
   audio, video, and session mode messaging - that SIP establishes.

N2) Section 1, 1st para, last sentence.
 Text on S/MIME plays no roles here, its context seems kind of odd. 
I believe the text only causes confusion thus should be removed.

N3) Section 4.4.1, 4th - 6th para
 Seems out of place. These paragraphs focus on policy-id usage and 
 its purpose, it should go into section 4.4.7.1.
 
N4) Section 4.4.1, 5th para 2nd sentence.
 [proxies > proxy]

N5) Section 4.4.1, 5th para, last sentence.
 [unnecessary "that"]
 
 OLD: combination that has configured the associated 

 NEW: combination has configured the associated

N6) Section 4.4.2, 2nd para, 2nd sentence
 [this policy server > associated policy server]
  
 OLD: The proxy SHOULD remove the Policy-Id header value for 
   this policy server from the Policy-Id header field before 
   forwarding the request. 

 NEW: The proxy SHOULD remove the Policy-Id header value for 
   the assocaited policy server from the Policy-Id header 
   field before forwarding the request. 

N7) Section 4.4.6, 1st para, 1st sentence
 [add MUST before apply]

 OLD: A UA compliant to this specification MUST contact the discovered
   policy servers and apply session policies to an offer or answer
   before using the offer or answer.

 NEW: A UA compliant to this specification MUST contact the discovered
   policy servers and MUST apply session policies to an offer or answer
   before using the offer or answer.

N8) Section 4.4.6, last para

 OLD: A UA MUST inform the policy server when a session is terminated via
   the policy channel.  This enables a policy server to free all
   resources it may have allocated for this session.  A policy server
   can indicate via the policy channel that it does not need to be
   contacted at the end of a session.  In this case, the UA SHOULD NOT
   inform the policy server about the termination of the session.

 NEW: A UA MUST inform the policy server when a session is terminated via
   the policy channel unless, a policy server
   indicates via the policy channel that it does not need to be
   contacted at the end of a session. This enables a policy server to free all
   resources it may have allocated for this session.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Requesting Answering Modes for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: D. Willis, A. Allen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-answermode-04.txt
	Pages		: 25
	Date		: 2007-6-12
	
This document defines extends SIP with two header fields and
   associated option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey
   the requester's preference for user-interface handling related to
   answering of that request.  The first header, "Answer-Mode",
   expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface
   waits for user input before accepting the request or instead accepts
   the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, "Priv-
   Answer-Mode" is similar to the first, except that it requests
   administrative-level access and has consequent additional
   authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have
   applicability to applications such as Push-to-Talk and to diagnostics
   like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate
   how the request was handled is also defined.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then 
"get draft-ietf-sip-answermode-04.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-answermode-04.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

This is ancient, badly written in a hurry, and full of errors, but it  
might help:

This version is a third attempt to address the sponsoring chair's  
(that would be Keith) comments as raised during the PROTO writeup  
prior to sending this puppy off to the IESG. Note that this is AFTER  
WGLC.

Two points:

1) Thirty percent of the supporting text has been touched in the  
process. If you care, you might want to eyeball the latest draft.  
There should be no impacts to implementors (except, perhaps, cognitive).

2) Given the depth and breadth of the comments during PROTO writeup,  
clearly, we aren't doing all that good of a job in reviewing drafts  
during WGLC. The floor is open on how to do a better job. Anybody  
have ideas?

In my opinion, content-type is not good enough. What would one do if it
is Multipart-Mixed?
We are talking about something general, right? What if the same content
type is to be used for 2 different info usages?

Christer asked if there are real life problems with using INFO for DTMF,
I think it's one of the problems today with INFO in general. I'm sure it
can be solved (e.g., the old draft Dean sent), but it still requires
change in the spec.

Returning to the question, "why not do INFO for DTMF?". Let's assume
there are good solutions to all the problems one can find with INFO for
DTMF then:
1. It might be different than existing implementations therefore
implementors that already have it will still need to change their
implementation.
2. It might simply provide a subset/same functionality KPML provides.

Regards,
Gilad

I've recently revised my draft on UA loose routing. You can pick it up here:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-01.txt

This draft is meant to fulfill one of our charter items:
Feb 2008	  	Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to 
IESG (PS)

As folks may recall, the GRUU spec used to have these things called 
grids, which allowed a UA to add its own parameters to the GRUU before 
handing it out. Several GRUU revisions back, this function got yanked 
because it was recognized that the problem was more general than GRUU, 
and would be useful for AOR as well.

Two IETFs back I presented this draft briefly during a SIP session. 
There was a lot of interest and people liked it architecturally, however 
there were two open issues that needed to get resolved. This mail is 
meant to start discussion on one of them - backwards compatibility.

THe mechanism basically changes the way proxies handle requests. Instead 
of rewriting the request URI for out-of-dialog requests, they'll push a 
route header and leave the r-uri alone. This allows the original R-URI 
and any parameters it contains to get delivered to the UAS.

So, the main issue is, what kinds of backwards compatibility problems 
will this cause. The draft provides a basic mechanism whereby a UA 
includes an option tag in the REGISTER, and the registrar indicates that 
it is using this mechanism or not. So we can negotiate this between a UA 
and registrar easily. Now, the problem is with intermediate proxies. If 
there is an edge proxy between the UA and its registrar, it will now see 
requests targeted to the UA, which contain a Route header beyond itself, 
even though it thinks its the edge proxy and the last point of contact 
before the UA. Technically, if this edge proxy is compliant to rfc3261 
it would work. However, the question is whether proxies in the wild 
would properly work in this case.

If folks can comment based on their own products, or their experiences, 
on whether they think this would work, or concerns they have, that would 
be great. THere are solutions that would allow us to disable the 
mechanism when intermediate proxies don't support it, but they are more 
complex and I'd rather avoid it.

THanks,
Jonathan R.

With the proposed UA loose routing mechanism, a UA can mint new AORs or 
new GRUUs by simply adding URI params to its AOR or gruu, and passing 
them around.

The question is, do we need to standardize the set of URI params that 
the UA can add to its AOR or GRUU?

One argument in favor of such a thing is that it avoids conflicts with 
URI params that might be meaningful to the home proxy, unbeknownst to 
the UA. It also helps guide implementations on what to expect in URIs 
when this capability is used.

On the other hand, by not standardizing a URI param, we can allow UA to 
use any number of params using names of their liking, which is nice and 
flexible.

A middle-ground is to standardize a prefix, kind of like what we did for 
media feature tags in RFC 3840 (though not a shining example of a 
successful RFC).

I've been back and forth on this, but based on the principle of least 
surprise, would propose a specific URI parameter be chosen.

Comments?

Hi Jonathan,

Is there a reason why the usage of P-Called-Party is not listed as an
alternative solution in chapter 4?

Hi,

At least with existing MGCs you will have backward compability issues.

MGCs normally route SIP-to-ISUP calls based on the Request-URI, and if =
the Request-URI contains e.g. a sos servicetype URN, or a 800 service =
number, the MGC will not be able to route on those.

Regards,

Christer

Hi Dean,

Thanks for the document. I have read it before, but had forgotten about =
it.

Now, the first issue is how we know that the receiver supports the =
Content-Type of the body sent in INFO. There are ways to solve that, and =
it is not an INFO specific problem.

The second issue is regarding the "SIP protocol rules", and I guess that =
is one thing which causes confusion.=20

For example, if someone wants to send a DTMF tone he sends an INFO with =
the DTMF tone. The receiver will determine whether it's needed for =
anything (e.g. a robot asking for your PIN code) or not (e.g. if you're =
talking to a person and pressed a button by misstake). What "SIP =
protocol rules" do you need for that? The application will determine =
what/if it does with the received information.

Regards,

Christer

What real-life problems are there with using INFO for DTMF?

(As WG chair)

I have just requested publication of:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-answermode-04.txt

The next stage for submitting comments is therefore the IESG last call.

The PROTO writeup submitted with the publication request is as follows.

Please feel free to respond if you consider any of the information
incorrect.

Regards

Keith

PROTO writeup for http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-
answermode-04.txt: "Requesting Answering Modes for the Session
Initiation=20
Protocol (SIP)"

   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
          document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

Keith Drage

The document has been reviewed and is ready for forwarding to IESG for=20
publication.

   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

Document history:

WGLC was initiated on draft-ietf-sip-answermode-00 on 23rd February 2006
with=20
comments requested by 15th March 2006.

Reviews were conducted by and comments received from Hans Persson,
Jeroen=20
van Bemmel, and Paul Kyzivat. At least 5 other people commented on
earlier=20
versions of the document.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session=20
Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no
external=20
review from an external specialist is necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this document
          been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the
          disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on
          this issue.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the document.

There have been no IPR disclosures on this document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

Section 1 of the document represents the background to the initiation of

this work, and details a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution
in=20
this area. However uses in the SIP WG were found for a more general=20
mechanism. Less generic parts of the original proposal form the basis of
a=20
separate draft draft-allen-sipping-poc-p-answer-state-header-04 being=20
progressed under the rules of RFC 3427 as a P-header.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.)  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?  If the document
          does not already indicate its intended status at the top of
          the first page, please indicate the intended status here.

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines new SIP headers and a new SIP option tag,
these=20
have been performed as a SIP working group item, and therefore this
draft is=20
in conformance with RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS (idnits 2.04.09) the checks report no errors.

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative references are now published RFCs. There
are=20
no downward references.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document's IANA
          Considerations section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggest a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the
          document describes an Expert Review process, has the Document
          Shepherd conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that
          the IESG can appoint the needed Expert during IESG Evaluation?

Section 8 of the document contains the IANA considerations.

Section 8.1 of the document registers the two new SIP header fields that
are=20
defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent with
RFC=20
3968 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the current=20
format of the registry.

Section 8.2 of the document registers two new header field parameters
for=20
the new Answer-Mode header field, and which are defined elsewhere in the

document. Section 8.2 of the document also registers the same two new
header=20
field parameters for the new Priv-Answer-Mode header field, and again
these=20
are defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent
with=20
RFC 3968 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the
current=20
format of the registry.

Section 8.3 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new
option-tag=20
is defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent
with=20
RFC 3968 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the
current=20
format of the registry.

It has been checked that there are no other protocol elements requiring=20
registration.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

Section 3 of the document specifies the new headers in ABNF. This ABNF=20
passes the checks in http://rtg.ietf.org/~fenner/abnf.cgi.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

          Technical Summary
             Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract
             and/or introduction of the document.  If not, this may be
             an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract
             or introduction.

          Working Group Summary
             Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting?  For
             example, was there controversy about particular points or
             were there decisions where the consensus was particularly
             rough?

          Document Quality
             Are there existing implementations of the protocol?  Have a
             significant number of vendors indicated their plan to
             implement the specification?  Are there any reviewers that
             merit special mention as having done a thorough review,
             e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a
             conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?  If
             there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review,
             what was its course (briefly)?  In the case of a Media Type
             review, on what date was the request posted?

          Personnel
             Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Who is the
             Responsible Area Director?  If the document requires IANA
             experts(s), insert 'The IANA Expert(s) for the registries
             in this document are <TO BE ADDED BY THE AD>.'

Technical Summary

This document defines extends SIP with two header fields and associated=20
option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the
requester's=20
preference for user-interface handling related to answering of that
request. =20
The first header, "Answer-Mode", expresses a preference as to whether
the=20
target node's user interface waits for user input before accepting the=20
request or instead accepts the request without waiting on user input.
The=20
second header, "Priv-Answer-Mode" is similar to the first, except that
it=20
requests administrative-level access and has consequent additional=20
authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have=20
applicability to applications such as Push-to-Talk and to diagnostics
like=20
loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate how the

request was handled is also defined.

Working Group Summary

There is consensus in the working group to publish this document. The=20
proposal was originally submitted as a P-header, but it was decided that

this aspect should be brought out and made generally applicable to all
SIP=20
implementations. Early concerns about the possibility to use the header
as a=20
means of eavesdropping have been addressed in the security
considerations.

Document Quality

There has been no indication of implementation. The document has been=20
required in support of the OMA PoC feature, and it can be assumed that
there=20
have been implementations of the OMA work that have therefore used this=20
feature.

Personnel

The document shepherd for this document was Keith Drage. The responsible

Area Director was Cullen Jennings. The IANA Expert(s) for the registries
in=20
this document are <TO BE ADDED BY THE AD>.

Hello,

I read through the draft sip-subnot-etags-00 and I found several issues
that needs to be clarified.


1. typo in introduction
In sentence "Typically, a SUBSCRIBE request is issued whenever a
subscription is installed, periodically refreshed or terminated." shall
be probably "NOTIFY".

2. some kind of misleading in text when talking about SIP PUBLISH
message as an example of entity tags usage. When talking about PUBLISH I
think, there is slightly different usage scenario. In response to
initial PUBLISH message, server generates entity tag. Client is mandated
to use this entity tag if she wants to change state of that particular
presence source. If this entity tag is not used, PUBLISH message
installs new presence source and not overwrites the former state. For
purposes of presence notifications, these publications are then
composed. This usage is a bit different that supposed for SUBSCRIBE
messages, The text evokes feeling of something different.

3. What is exactly meant with "Meta-information-check"? What is this
meta information.

4. Besides RLS subscriptions there is one more problem, the
subscriptions to changes in documents. So extend the problem also on
notification about changes in multiple documents.

5. In my mind, there popped up an idea to move the SIP-Etag into the
response to SUBSCRIBE message. This way client can be informed about the
entity tag also without sending the NOTIFY message at all. Have you
considered this possibility?

6. What about situation when e.g. presentity has no presence document
installed and some body subscribes her. The the notifier sends empty
document, wouldn't be there some special handling? E.g. no entity tag.

You have an MGC that registers?

If so, it can avoid this problem by not using the new option when 
registering. This is *optional* behavior.

jonathan,

[open]ser proxies have a large number of functions to examine and
manipulate request uri.  it would mean lots of coding work to make all
same functions apply to an uri in the route header.  so i don't like
this change at all.

why can't you say that when proxies rewrite request uri, they need to
leave parameters (or at least some parameters) alone?

or, why can't you say that if a proxy rewrites request uri, it needs to
push the original request uri into some new header unless this new
header already exists?

Hi,

Another thing to keep in mind is that when the Path header is used, the =
generated Route (used from the home proxy towards the UE) will not be =
identical to the Path.

Route =3D Path + pushed Route

Now, I don't know whether RFC3327 says that the Route MUST be identical =
to the Path it's based on, or whether it's allowed to add Route(s) in =
addition to those based on the Path, but there could be intermediates =
that do some kind of checking.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

This is not very relevant to the loose route solution as such, but just
a small comment on the emergency service use-case.

I am not sure whether the emergency service centers will always
register, and if they don't loose route of course does not solve the
problem.

Regards,

Christer

(As WG chair)

We have got a number of threads floating round on INFO usage, and it
would be nice to identify this into a potential body of work, and see if
there is support for it.

We have two previous drafts that never went anywhere, although contents
of both carried support in the WG at the time:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rosenberg-sip-info-harmful-00

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO method defines a means for
   transporting mid-dialog application layer data between user agents.
   Its initial use was to support the transport of ISUP mid-call
   messages which could not be mapped to any other SIP request method.
   However, since its initial usage for that purpose, INFO has seen
   widespread abuse as a means for introducing non-standard and
   non-interoperable extensions to SIP.  For this reason, we now believe
   INFO should be considered harmful, and therefore, deprecated in its
   current form.

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-willis-sip-infopackage-00

   The SIP INFO method (RFC 2976) establishes a method by which
   applications may transfer application-specific information within a
   SIP dialog.  However, RFC 2976 does not provide a mechanism for
   describing and documenting an application of INFO, nor does it
   provide a mechanism by which applications may negotiate such uses.
   This document provides a framework for documenting and naming
   specific uses of INFO (called INFO packages), for registering those
   package names with IANA, and for negotiating the support for various
   INFO packages between applications using SIP.

In the thread so far there have also been suggestions that cover:

-	support to mediactrl for their discussion on requirements
-	something for hitchhiker's guide to point to:
-	something that answers all the questions that recur on this list
on INFO usage
-	"I've been getting a lot of offline questions asking for the
"right" way to carry information related to the session-usage (often
information that's being tunneled around from companion or gatewayed
protocols)."
-	INVITE dialog usage only, or already covered by RFC 2976
-	It would be OK with me if we ALSO had this type of guidance
("don't look HERE, look over THERE") available ("stated strongly enough
in an easy to stumble across place"), but if coming up with that
guidance takes more than about a week, I don't see a lot of reason to
hold up on "don't go there" 
while we explore alternatives.
-	INFO and DTMF
-	XML payloads
-	But people really need is guidance on when to use INFO, when to
use events, and when to use something entirely different.
-	identification of purpose of info (Content-Type? - impacted by
multipart/mixed)
-	any framework for control of usages (IANA registration? - RFC
3427 update)

Would anybody out there like to have a go at drafting an abstract for a
potential WG deliverable (and also identifying level - Info, BCP,
standards track) and submitting it to the list for discussion. Remember
an abstract needs to:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Every RFC must have an Abstract section following the Copyright notice.
An Abstract will typically be 5-10 lines. An Abstract of more than 20
lines is generally not acceptable. 

The Abstract section should provide a concise and comprehensive overview
of the purpose and contents of the entire document, to give a
technically knowledgeable reader a general overview of the function of
the document. In addition to its function in the RFC itself, the
Abstract section text will appear in publication announcements and in
the online index of RFCs. 

Composing a useful Abstract generally requires thought and care. Usually
an Abstract should begin with a phrase like "This memo ..." or "This
document ...". A satisfactory abstract can often be constructed in part
from material within the Introduction section, but a good abstract will
be shorter, less detailed, and perhaps broader in scope than the
Introduction. Simply copying and pasting the first few paragraphs of the
Introduction is tempting, but it may result in an Abstract that is both
incomplete and redundant. Note also that an Abstract is not a substitute
for an Introduction; the RFC should be self-contained as if there were
no Abstract section. 

An Abstract should be complete in itself; it should not contain
citations unless they are completely defined within the Abstract.
Abbreviations appearing in the Abstract should generally be expanded in
parentheses. There is a small set of reasonable exceptions to this rule
(see guidelines on abbreviations, above.) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------

And as such should give a clear idea of whether there is anything we
should charter here or not.

Regards

Keith

Good catch. I'll change the MIME type in the framework to

Yes. The policy event package supports this.

I think it is unlikely that a policy server would decline a session at 
this point since it has accepted the offer earlier. If it does occur, 
the correct behavior for the UA would be to terminate the session by 
sending a BYE. I believe section 4.4.6. covers this to some extend but 
maybe this needs to be made more explicit.

COMMENTS:

1)	Section 4.4.7.2:

   A proxy MAY add the "non-
   cacheable" header field parameter to indicate that a UA MUST NOT
   cache this policy server URI.

You are either mixing a proxy requirement and a UA requirement in the
same sentence here, or we have one instance two many of RFC 2119
language. Either way, what we have is the wrong of writing it.

2)	For reference [4] config-framework, I am missing any RFC 2119
language round it. I think we are saying "provides the only way of"
rather than "provides one means of" therefore I would have expected a
"MUST implement".

3)	Section 4.4:

If we show the table of support in methods, I would prefer we show all
the current methods, and therefore show all the "-". There are other SIP
documents you can use as a template.

4)	Update reference [7] from RFC 2327 to RFC 4566. There does not
seem to be any need to reference the older version.

5)	With regard to reference [8] RFC 3264 the text:

   A UAC compliant to this specification MUST include a Supported header
   field with the option tag "policy" into all requests that can
   initiate an offer/answer exchange [8] (e.g.  INVITE, UPDATE and PRACK
   requests).=20

Makes this a normative reference rather than an informative reference.

6)	One of the requirements of RFC 4485 (Guidelines to SIP authors)
is to clearly structure the requirements relating to each entity.=20

A)	I see a mixture of requirements for UAC and policy server in
section 3.2, and some of the requirements apply to both.=20
B)	In section 4.4.7.1 can you move the RFC 2119 requirement to the
appropriate procedures section.=20
C)	The same applies for section 4.4.7.2.=20
D)	Can you explain why section 3.2 and section 4.5 are so widely
separated?

7)	Section 3.2:

   The session-independent policies contained in a
   notification MUST represent a complete session-independent policy.
   Deltas to previous policies or partial policies are not supported.=20

Seems to be primarily a sending requirement (i.e. for the policy
server). Please write "The policy server MUST..." and if there is a
separate receiver (UAC) requirement, then draft a separate statement.

8)	There are two ways of doing the requirements for security. One
is to put all the RFC 2119 language relating to security in the security
considerations section, which is apparently what this draft does. The
other is to integrate these requirements in the procedures and reflect
on the security support given by these requirements in the security
considerations section. I prefer the latter - it makes it harder for an
implementor to ignore the security requirements.

9)	I don't like the semantics of the option tag registration. I
would prefer to relate this to support of particular procedures, rather
than support of the headers. Support of headers is a bit nebulous - a
proxy supports it if it passes it on transparently. A UA supports it if
it renders the contents to a user.

10)	Can you put the appendixes at the end of the document, thereby
bringing forward the references and author details.

NITS:

1)	For all response code usage, use the form "488 (Not Acceptable
Here) response" rather than any abbreviated form on all occurrences.
=09
2)	There seems to be a significant usage of "it" in statements with
RFC 2119 language, as in=20
  =20
   It SHOULD store
   policy server URIs in this list even if they are marked as "non-
   cacheable"

Please use the name of entity even if it was included in the conditional
at the start of the sentence, or in a previous sentence.

3)	In all references made from the text, rather than statements of
the form

	(e.g. according to [6])

Can we use either:

	(e.g. according to RFC 3261 [6])

Or

	(e.g. according to [RFC3261])

To save having to refer to the list at the end of the document.

4)	Please deal with idnits as identified below:

5)	I suspect you will need to update the address for Jonathan
Rosenberg.

6)	Section 1:

   However, experience has shown that there is a need for SIP
   intermediaries to impact aspects of a session.  For example, SIP may
   be used in a wireless network, which has limited resources for media
   traffic.

Change "may" --> "can"

Also same paragraph:

   Similarly, a
   network provider may have a service level agreement with a user that
   defines the set of media types a user can use.=20

Change "may" --> "can"

Also section 1:

   Domains often enforce the session policies they have in place.  For
   example, a domain might have a policy that disallows the use of video
   and may enforce this policy by dropping all packets that contain a
   video encoding.=20

Change "may" --> "can"

And same paragraph

   This may
   lead to a malfunctioning of devices that is incomprehensible to the
   user.

Change "may" --> "can"

7)	Section 3:

   Session-independent policies are policies that are created
   independent of a session and generally apply to all sessions a user
   agent is setting up.  They typically remain stable for a longer
   period of time and apply to any session set up while they are valid.
   However, session-independent policies may also change over time. For
   example, a policy that defines a bandwidth limit for a user may
   change during the day, defining a lower limit during peak hours and
   allow more bandwidth off-peak.

Change "may" --> "can" twice.

8)	Section 3.1

   A SIP UA may receive session-independent policies from one or more
   policy servers.  In a typical configuration, a UA receives session-
   independent policies from a policy server in the access or local
   network domain (i.e. the domain from which the UA receives IP
   service) and possibly the home network domain (i.e. the domain the UA
   registers at).  The local network may have policies that support the
   access network infrastructure.  For example, in a wireless network
   where bandwidth is scarce, a provider may restrict the bandwidth
   available to an individual user.  The home network may have policies
   that are needed to support services or policies that reflect the
   service level agreement with the user.  Thus, in most cases, a UA
   will receive session-independent policies from one or two policy
   servers.

Change "may" --> "can" three times.

   2.  The policy server selects the policies that apply to this user
       agent.  The policy server may have general policies that apply to
       all users or maintain separate policies for each individual user.
       The selected policies are returned to the user agent.
   3.  The policy server may update the policies, for example, when
       network conditions change.

Change "may" --> "can" twice.

9)	Section 3.2:

   A change in the policy may be triggered, for
   example, by a change in the network status, by the change in the time
   of day or by an update of the service level agreement with the
   customer.

Change "may" --> "can"

10)	Section 4:

   Session-specific policies are policies that are created specifically
   for one particular session of a UA.  Thus, session-specific policies
   will typically be different for different sessions.  The session-
   specific policies for a session may change during the course of the
   session.  For example, a user may run out of credit during a session,
   which will cause the network to disallow the transmission all media
   streams from this point on.

Change "may" --> "can" twice.

11)	Section 4.1:

   The policy server is a separate logical entity that may be physically
   co-located with the proxy.  The role of the policy server is to
   deliver session policies to UAs.  The policy server receives session
   information from the UA, uses this information to determine the
   policies that apply to the session and returns these policies to the
   UA.  The mechanism for generating policies (i.e. making policy
   decisions) is outside of the scope of this specification.  A policy
   server may, for example, query an external entity to get policies or
   it may directly incorporate a policy decision point and generate
   policies locally.

Change "may" --> "can" three times.

And in the same section:

   A UA receives the URI of a policy server from a proxy.  It uses this
   URI to contact the policy server.  It provides information about the
   current session to the policy server and receives session policies in
   response.  The UA may also receive policy updates from the policy
   server during the course of a session.

Change "may" --> "can"

   A network may have a policy enforcement infrastructure in place.
   However, this specification does not make any assumptions about the
   enforcement of session policies and the mechanisms defined here are
   orthogonal a policy enforcement infrastructure.  Their goal is to
   provide a mechanism to convey session information to a policy server
   and to return the policies that apply to a session to the UA.

Change "may" --> "can"

12)	Section 4.2:

   In many cases, the mechanism for session-specific policies will be
   used to disclose session information and return session policies.
   However, some scenarios may only involve the disclosure of session
   information to a network intermediary.  If an intermediary does not
   intend to return a policy, it can simply accept the session as it was
   proposed.  Similarly, some session-specific policies only apply to
   the offer (and therefore only require the disclosure of the offer)
   whereas others apply to offer and answer.  Both types of policies are
   supported by session-specific policy mechanism.

Change "may" --> "can"

13)	Section 4.4.1:

   A UAC may receive a 488 response that contains a Policy-Contact
   header field.

Change "may" --> "can"

   The token is an opaque
   string the UAC may have received from the policy server after
   contacting it.

Change "may" --> "can"

      Note: it has been proposed to use the Policy-Id header to provide
      a hint for a proxy that the UAC has actually contacted the policy
      server.  This usage also requires the policy server to return a
      token to the UA.  In addition, the policy server needs to share
      valid tokens with the proxy.  After receiving a request with a
      Policy-Id header, the proxy can determine if the token in the
      Policy-Id header is valid.  If it is valid, the proxy knows that
      the UA has contacted the policy server for this session.  However,
      it is important to note that this token does not provide any proof
      that the UA has actually used the policies it has received from
      the policy server.  A malicious UA may simply contact the policy
      server, discard all policies it receives but still use the token
      in the Policy-Id header.

Change "may" --> "can"
Delete: "it is important to note that".

   In some cases, a request may traverse multiple domains with session-
   policies in place.  Each of these domains may return a 488 response
   containing a policy server URI.

Change "may" --> "can" twice.

   A UA may decide to change the session description of a session and to
   initiate subsequent offer/answer exchanges (e.g. using INVITE, UPDATE
   or PRACK requests) to re-negotiate the session description.=20

Change "may" --> "can"

14)	Section 4.4.2:

   If the local policy server URI is present in a Policy-Id header value
   of a request, then the proxy MUST NOT reject the request as described
   above (it may still reject the request for other reasons).

Change "may" --> "can"

15)	Section 4.4.3:

   A UAS may receive an INVITE, UPDATE or PRACK request (or another
   request that can initiate offer/answer exchanges), which contains a
   Policy-Contact header filed with a list of policy server URIs.

Change "may" --> "can"

   A UAS may receive a token from a policy server via the policy
   channel.  Since the UAS does not create a Policy-ID header, it can
   simply ignore this token.

Change "may" --> "can"

16)	Section 4.4.4:

   A UAC may frequently need to contact the policy server in the local
   domain before sending a request.  To avoid the retransmission of the
   local policy server URI for each new request, a UA SHOULD maintain a
   cache that contains the URI of the local policy server.  A UA may
   receive this URI in a Policy-Contact header of a request or a 488
   response.  The UA may also receive the local policy server URI
   through configuration, for example, via the configuration framework
   [4].  If a UA has received a local policy server URI through
   configuration and receives another local policy server URI in a
   Policy-Contact header, it SHOULD overwrite the configured URI with
   the most recent one received in a Policy-Contact header.

Change "may" --> "can" three times.

   The UA SHOULD NOT cache policy server URIs it has received from
   proxies outside of the local domain.  These policy servers may not be
   relevant for subsequent sessions, which may go to a different
   destination, traversing different domains.

Change "may not" to "need not"
Change "may" --> "can"

   The UA MUST NOT cache tokens it may receive from a policy server.  A
   token is only valid for one request.

Change "may" --> "can"

17)	Section 4.4.6:

      Note: this assumes that the policy server can always respond
      immediately to a policy request and does not require manual
      intervention to create a policy.  This will be the case for most
      policy servers.  If, however, a policy server cannot respond with
      a policy right away, it may return a policy that temporarily
      denies the session and update this policy as the actual policy
      decision becomes available.  A delay in the response from the
      policy server to the UA would delay the transmission of the ACK
      and could trigger retransmissions of the INVITE response (also see
      the recommendations for Flow I in [9]).

Change "may" --> "can"

   A UA MUST inform the policy server when a session is terminated via
   the policy channel.  This enables a policy server to free all
   resources it may have allocated for this session.  A policy server
   can indicate via the policy channel that it does not need to be
   contacted at the end of a session.  In this case, the UA SHOULD NOT
   inform the policy server about the termination of the session.

Change "may have" --> "has"

18)	Section 4.4.7.1:

   The value of a Policy-Id header consists of a policy server URI.  A
   Policy-Id header value may have an optional token parameter.  The
   token parameter contains a token the UA may receive from the policy
   server. =20

Change "may have" --> "can have"
Change "may receive" --> "received"=20

19)	Section 4.5:

   If the policy update causes a change in the session
   description of a session, the UA may need to re-negotiate the
   modified session description with its peer UA, for example, using a
   re-INVITE or UPDATE request.

Change "may need" to "needs".

20	Section 5:

   Session policies can significantly change the behavior of a user
   agent and can be used by an attacker to compromise a user agent.  For
   example, session policies can be used to prevent a user agent from
   successfully establishing a session (e.g. by setting the available
   bandwidth to zero).  Such a policy can be submitted to the user agent
   during a session, which may cause the UA to terminate the session.

Change "may cause" to "causes".

   A user agent transmits session information to a policy server for
   session-specific policies.  This session information may contain
   sensitive data the user may not want an eavesdropper or an
   unauthorized policy server to see.  For example, the session
   information may contain the encryption keys for media streams.  Vice
   versa, session policies may also contain sensitive information about
   the network or service level agreements the service provider may not
   want to disclose to an eavesdropper or an unauthorized user agent.

Change "may contain" to "can contain" twice
Change "may not" to "does not" twice
Change "may also" to "can also"

   This would impede the rendezvous between UA and policy server and,
   since the UA would not contact the policy server, may prevent a UA
   from setting up a session.

Change "may" to "can"

   Policy servers SHOULD authenticate UAs to protect the information
   that is contained in a session policy.  However, a policy server may
   also frequently encounter UAs it cannot authenticate.=20

Change "may" to "can"

(As WG chair)

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-03
.txt=20

Describes a set of requirements for:

   This document defines requirements for adding certificate
   authentication to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This
   document is being presented with the intention of providing clear
   requirements to any potential solutions specifying certificate
   authentication within SIP networks.  Supporting certificate
   authentication in SIP would provide strong authentication and
   increase the types of possible deployment scenarios.

(Before we go any further, please forget all about the solutions
document - that comes later and we are not dealing with it now)

We need to decide whether there is support for a body of work in this
area, and therefore whether we should charter some requirements work in
the SIP WG.

(Because this is security related we have agreed that SIP does the
requirements drafting and not SIPPING)

So can I hear opinions of the WG on:

-	whether this represents a problem space that the working group
should draft requirements on?

-	whether the problem space exists but is something slightly
different, and if so what is that problem space?

-	whether there is a more general problem that the security area
should be addressing, rather than the SIP group addressing something
specific?

-	based on your answers to the first three questions, whether this
draft is essentially in the right direction to be adopted as the WG
draft assuming we create the charter item, or whether we need to seek
some other input draft?

-	and finally, whether (assuming we go ahead with this work) there
is any work in any other IETF WG that we should take account of?

Keith

There's a lot of talk about INFO and KPML.  But people should be aware
that most SIP phone systems in the field use RTP (RFC 4733) to
transmit DTMF digits.

   I am just trying to figure out what the problem really is.

There is an ambiguity in what Content-Type means: "what sort of media
does this encoded data represent" vs. "what you should do with this
data".  I don't think there are any cases in current SIP
implementations where this is a practical problem.  I expect that in
most cases where "what you should do with this data" is not completely
implied by "what sort of media this represents", the situation will be
complex enough that the applications will define extension headers to
disambiguate the situation, define extension media types to carry the
"intention", or more likely, represent the data as an XML structure
which explicitly states the intended action.

"Spray and pray" is fun for kids in street gangs but well-aimed fire  
is far more efficient and much safer for  innocent bystanders.

Staying with the use of DTMF/INFO as an example (which, I'd like to  
add, has been deprecated even if I did originally endorse or maybe  
even coinvent it) . . .

Before you send a DTMF/INFO, you really need to know that the  
recipient understands DTMF/INFO in general and the specific encoding  
of DTMF in INFO that you're using (there have been multiple encodings  
proposed). Otherwise you wouldn't even bother sending it unless  
you're a hopeless optimist, trying to impress your homies with the  
size of your packet-slinger, or just plain stoopid.

And beyond just understanding your encoding of DTMF/INFO, you need to  
know that the recipient you are sending it to is likely to do  
something useful with that INFO, and that this "something useful" is  
what you intend it to do when you send it.

Now, for DTMF/INFO the "something useful" is pretty straightforward  
-- take the tone sequences and either use them as input to a local  
application or mix them back into the media stream.

Other possible uses for INFO (and there have been many proposed) are  
not generally so clear. For example, if I send you an INFO containing  
a JPEG file, what are you supposed to do with it? Project the  image  
onto the wall? Use it is a keyboard map? Use it as a voiceprint graph  
for spectral comparison with my media stream as a means of performing  
a MITM detection? (hey, I think I just invented something . . .) Or  
something entirely different?

What is wrong with INFO as currently specified is that we have no way  
of answering these questions. Content-disposition and content-type  
just aren't rich enough for the range of possibilities.

So we either have to rigorously NOT use INFO for anything new (and it  
is currently defined only for telephony tunneling), or extend it to  
be able to differentiate usages.  My personal feeling is that the  
wild INFO cat has leapt out of the bag and run off to have kittens,  
so we're better off giving those kittens names and vaccinations than  
we are trying to convince people not to pet the cat.

(As WG chair)

As well as agreeing to charter the item, we actually agreed at IETF#67
that this draft was a suitable candidate to fulfil that charter item.=20

Therefore unless issues are raised with this, I would request the editor
(as Jonathan is editor) to submit the next version of this document as
draft-ietf-sip-ua-loose-route-00.

I don't think an application will trigger INFOs in a spray and pray
matter. You will only send media server control messages if you are
communicating with a media server control application that understands
them.

>Staying with the use of DTMF/INFO as an example (which, I'd=20

It hasn't been deprecated outside out on the field.

Yes, and you know that if you receive an indication from the other party
that he supports application/my-dtmf (or whatever value is used).

And, if we would have standardized one encoding, maybe there wouldn't be
multiple ones out there...

Yes, but you wouldn't send it unless you have a reason to think the
receiver is going to do something with it, e.g. if you have been asked
to give your PIN code.=20

I don't understand why people think that applications would start
sending all kind of INFOs "just for fun", without any logic behind. I
have never seen that happen in real world deployments. I wouldn't start
sending UPDATEs and/or re-INVITEs just for fun either, eventhough there
is nothing preventing me from doing it.

Just because you CAN doesn't mean you WILL :)

That depends on the application. For example, the application may tell
you that a JPEG file has arrived, and ask what you want to do with it.
You may choose to project it, use it as a keyboard map, or whatever.

But, again, I don't think anyone is going to send you the JPEG file
"just like that", without any reason.

I don't think we need to answer those questions, because they are
application specific.

What we need to answer is the question how to indicate what
Content-Types the receiver supports, and is willing to receive for a
given session.=20

What we also should care about is to make sure that the Content-Types
are standardized, so that we don't have multiple, uninteroperable,
mechanisms doing the same thing out there.

I agree with you.

I think that INFO is an easy and useful tool, and the market seems to
think the same thing.

Hi,

We can call it loose route if we want, but I think the initial focus =
should be the problem we are going to solve (I don't think we agreed on =
a specific solution at #67), and we should look into alternative =
solutions (the draft does that in some extent, but other possible =
alternatives have also been mentioned).

Or, do you prefer to have separate drafts describing alternative =
solutions for the problem?

Regards,

Christer

As said in the draft, the loose route mechanism can only be used if the
UA has registered and indicated support of the loose route mechanism.

So, entities that do not register will not be able to use the mechanism.
And, to my understanding the ESCs will not always register, which mean
it's not possible to use the loose route mechanism to forward the
initial request to them.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

 I just glanced at the diff from the previous version that I read (ver-01).
>
> -	completeness - is there something missing?
>   
 Some of the major issues addressed on the list and on the SIP-SAML list 
(separate
list that was active a while back to discuss SAML usage in SIP) has not 
been resolved.
 Some of which may require an extension or change to the dependent draft 
(e.g. SIP-Identity).

 So I would have to say that it's still far from complete.
> -	applicability - does it identify and solve a problem?

 Yes.

 The text in the draft is fairly comprehensive and easy to understand.

 I believe the solution and approach seems to be sound, but will need to 
see
how the remaining issues are going to be addressed.

 Regards

Don't we need something that indicates to each UA what types of INFOs
the other UA should get? I still don't agree there is a 1:1 relationship
between content type and info purpose.

That depends on what "it" means, there are several old drafts for this
single functionality, for example one proposed to send MGCP in the body.
Another proposed a specific body. There are probably more. So is our
approach to document and standardize any proprietary implementation for
this? Even when we have alternatives?

Is the assumption that INFO is triggered by user and not by something in
the flow? Let's say I invent INFO that sends information on voice
quality in a call every X seconds. How does one indicate this
will/should be sent?

What if each is sent for a different reason and not just one picture is
sent? How do you tell the application "the reason"?

This is not your everyday kitten. This big cat bites and scratches. Or
maybe I've taken the metaphor too far...

Really - other than SIP-T, I don't understand so far what necessary
usages INFO has that do not have other viable/better alternatives. Just
because some company X did something and perhaps even company Y mimicked
it, who said it's a good idea. For any new usage I think of for INFO I
find a better solution in SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY...

Just like INFO should not be sent just for the heck of it, INFO usages
should not be invented just because it's possible.

I agree it's easy. Can it ease some implementation?

See 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-camarillo-sip-body-handling-01.txt

Content-Disposition is another part of the puzzle, as is use of headers 
that refer to body parts using cid: URIs. And the method is another 
criterion.

As a more difficult example, what do you suppose you should do if you 
receive an INFO message in a dialog, with a content-type of text/plain 
and a content-disposition of "render"? How would that handling differ 
from what you would do if it was a MESSAGE but otherwise the same?

You can pick out special cases and say "duh - what else could you do 
with DTMF digits"? But when you sit down to program a UA you need to 
come up with well defined algorithms to decide this stuff. As UAs get 
more and more sophisticated in the range of things they can do it will 
get more and more important to have semantics be well defined.

My problem with INFO is precisely because it has no semantics of how it 
should be processed, or how body parts that it carries should be 
processed differently than if the same parts were in some other message.

If there is some header and/or body part that should be processed the 
same, regardless of what message it is delivered in, then I have no 
problem with using INFO to convey it. But I don't think we have any of 
those.

How does my phone know it is communicating with a media server that 
understands INFO for conveying DTMF? The thing I call may indicate 
support of INFO because it supports qsig tunneling.

We currently have no way to say "I support mime-type foo for use with 
disposition bar and method baz", but in reality that is going to be the 
situation. I support sdp for disposition "session" in the methods that 
convey o/a. But I don't support sdp in MESSAGE or INFO. I support 
text/plain with content-type "render" in MESSAGE, but not for other 
dispositions and other message types.

Getting an indication of support for application/my-dtmf is useful *if* 
you know that the UA sending it to you always uses it the same ways you 
do. You can only know that if you control it, or if all the uses of that 
type are standardized.

Lets go back to my phone. *It* doesn't know that I have been asked to 
give my PIN code, even though I do. All my phone knows is that I have 
pressed one of the buttons on the keypad. It may reasonably infer that I 
want *something* to be done with them, and probably that I want them 
sent to the other end in some way. It has no idea *how* (or *if*) the 
other end is prepared to receive them.

For instance, it may have indicated support for a mime type that my 
phone knows how to use to encode DTMF. But its possible it was really 
trying to say that it would support that type in a NOTIFY (sent or 
received).

I will agree that if you have N different ways that you are able to send 
DTMF, and if the other party has indicated support for *something* that 
is consistent with one of them and not with any of the others, then you 
might reasonably decide to try that one. But it is still a somewhat iffy 
proposition. We would be much better served defining something more 
deterministic.

Hi Jonathan,

about the third redirection meaning:

   3.  The server is asking the client to route through an additional
       proxy prior to visiting it, so that the recursed request
       generated by the client pushes an additional Route onto the Route
       set.

I was wondering if it should be possible insert more than only one contact 
into the existing route set.
I'd like to know your opinion, because in my understanding it should not possible 
due to the "alternative" meaning of different locations into the the Contact 
header field; in fact the RFC3261 states:

   "When a redirect server returns a 3xx response to a request, it
   populates the list of (one or more) alternative locations into the
   Contact header field.  An "expires" parameter to the Contact header
   field values may also be supplied to indicate the lifetime of the
   Contact data."


About the persistence of the redirection for a mid-dialog request,
I am not sure it should persist just for the duration of the transaction, 
instead the persistence should be managed by the "expires" parameter.


regards
Sal

It should also indicate support (using the Accept header) of the
content-type which is used to transport the media control messages.

You don't have any way to say "I support mime-type SDP for use with
disposition bar and method baz" either - that we specify elsewhere.

And, if we define a DTMF mime-type, we should of course also say in
which SIP message it can be used etc. But, again, we should not specify
the applications that are going to use it.

Also, since INFO is not supposed to affect the SIP session, we can also
put restrictions on which disposition values are to be used etc.

So, of course there is some work to do, but that's not a reason to
reject something. If everything was done and ready, there would be no
need for the SIP WG :)

It's up to the applications to make sure that the DTMFs are sent and
intepreted. If the receiving application has not asked for DTMFs, and
the sender still sends them, the receiver should simply discard them.
It's part of the application logic - not the SIP protocol. The SIP
protocol defines information elements to indicate what content types you
support, what actions to take if the content type is not supported etc.
But, again: we don't specify what the applicatons are going to do with
information.

It's similar to when you use RFC2833 for sending DTMFs. The only thing
you do, as part of the offer/answer procedure, is agreeing that both
endpoints support RFC2833 - but you do not specify what the endpoints
are going to do with the tones, when they will be sent etc.

I think what you are talking about is how you will design your SIP
phone.

For example, on my table phone, if I during a call want to send DTMF
tones I have to first press one button to "active" DTMF, and then any
button I sent is sent as DTMF. If I am asked to give my PIN code, but do
not active DTMF, nothing will happen when I press the buttons.

On my GSM phone, however, I don't need to active DTMF. If I am asked to
give my PIN code, I simply press buttons and they are sent as DTMF
tones.

>For instance, it may have indicated support for a mime type=20
>that my phone knows how to use to encode DTMF. But its=20
>possible it was really trying to say that it would support=20
>that type in a NOTIFY (sent or received).

IF there are missing parts in the negotiation mechanism, we need to fix
that.

Something like:

Accept: application/my-dtmf;method=3DINFO

OR, in the draft defining the content type, we specify that content type
X can only be sent using this and that method. I belive we do the same
thing for SDP.

But, so far we haven't been interested in looking into these issues. We
just say that using INFO is against the spirit of SIP, it causes all
kind of problems etc etc.

My intention is not to "promote" the usage of INFO. My issue is that the
market has found and deployed an easy and effective way of doing things
using INFO, without breaking the protocol, and what worries me is that
instead of trying to help the market (e.g. by standardizing the content
types, providing negotiation mechanism to achieve interoperability), and
in that way indirectly help them to come up with new SIP applications,
we simply tell them that what they are doing (and have been doing for
years) is wrong, that they are breaking SIP, etc etc etc.

And, if we really wanted to restrict the usage of INFO, it should have
been done a long time ago - not years after the INFO RFC is published
and people have deployed usages of it.

Anyway, I guess we can go on with this discussion forever. Maybe we
should find some time in Chicago and sit down and discuss this?

Regards,

Christer

Christer,

Slightly aside from the main direction of the discussion, but what about
security? I send my audio using SRTP, and would expect DTMF to receive
exactly the same protection. The signalling may or may not be end-to-end
secured, depending on which of the current and future key management
methods are used. Maybe SIPS has to be used, but we all know the
limitations of that (e.g., if I receive an INVITE request to my SIPS
URI, can I be sure all hops are secured?). I am sure the IETF would not
want to endorse a mechanism that opens up a security hole that is not
present with an existing mechanism for doing the same thing (RFC 2833).

John

You appear to be questioning whether the solution was adopted. The =
minutes state:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Topic: GRUU and Supporting Drafts	 =20
Led by Jonathan Rosenberg =20
Slides included in proceedings=20
Read: draft-ietf-sip-gruu-11,draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-00

Change since last version reviewed.

Issue: GRUU subtype names. The room demonstrated a slight preference
for the names used in -11 over known alternatives, but nobody seems
particularly enamored with these names and the floor remains open to
suggestions.

Discussion on ua-loose-route draft deferred to next session.


Session 2: Friday 0900-1130 Grand Ballroom C


Topic: UA-loose-route, continued from previous session.

Consensus noted that we do need some sort of solution for the general
problem of delivery of URI parameters across contact-routing
operations.

Issue: Concerns raised about backward compatibility. Noted that
compliant P-CSCF should be OK.  Suggested that we have a design team
revisit call-flows and analyze for backward compatibility issues.

Issue: Does GRUU normatively depend on this work? Resolved: GRUU does
not reference this document. However, some participants feel it
should, as the benefit of GRUU cannot be fully recognized in the
absence of this specification.  The chairs asked for a hum, and the
consensus of the room is that GRUU and ua-loose-route can proceed
independently.

Question: Adopt this draft as baseline text for a WG effort, should
the ADs approve the milestone? Consensus to adopt noted by
chairs. To-do: Chairs to work with AD to set new milestone.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The minutes quite clearly say "Adopt this draft as baseline text for a =
WG effort" and given that the charter item now exists, then I believe =
that we are entitled to call for the editor (Jonathan) to submit the =
current text as draft-ietf-sip-ua-loose-route.

I agree the file name says loose-route, but I don'y think we should =
change that. After all, we lose that filename when it gets published as =
an RFC anyway.

The charter item states

Dec 2007    Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to =
WGLC =20
Feb 2008    Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to =
IESG (PS)  =20

I assume that you are OK with this.

What I would suggest is that you address specific comments to the title =
of the deliverable:

	Applying Loose Routing to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents =
(UA)

And to the abstract:

Abstract

   A key part of the behavior of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   is that SIP proxies rewrite the Request-URI as a request moves
   throughout the network.  Over the years, experience has shown this to
   be problematic.  It makes it difficult to use Request URI for service
   invocation, complicates emergency services, makes it more complex to
   support aliases, and so on.  Architecturally, it confounds the
   concepts of address and route.  This document proposes to change this
   through a new mechanism called UA loose routing.

As you think appropriate to your concerns.

Alternatively, if you (or indeed any other SIP WG member) do have a =
completely different solution, then there is still time to post an =
individual draft or post a skeleton of a mechanism to the list.

Keith

Hi John,

I hear what you are saying, but I don't see how this is specific to DTMF =
and INFO.=20

Doesn't this affect all I kind of sensitive information that you want to =
transport over SIP?

Hi Keith,

The text you sent says:

"Consensus noted that we do need some sort of solution for the general =
problem of delivery of URI parameters across contact-routing =
operations."

I have no problems with that.=20

I also have no problem with using Jonathan's draft as base line, because =
the draft discusses the problem in a good way.

But, still: as the text says, the agreement was to come up with SOME =
SORT OF SOLUTION, which to me does not mean that we have agreed to adopt =
the specific solution in Jonathan's draft. We should also be "allowed" =
to discuss alternative solutions, whether they are based on =
P-Called-Party, some other header, some URI parameter, or whatever... =
Maybe those alternative solutions do not work, and then we should =
describe that (as Jonathan has done for the To header- and History =
header alternatives).

Regards,

Christer

Christer,

Yes, it affects all information, but in the case of DTMF we already have =
a mechanism for securing it, SRTP. So why attempt to standardise a new =
mechanism for transporting DTMF that introduces security issues that are =
already solved with the existing mechanism?

It is entirely appropriate at this stage to put forward alternatives. It =
is even more appropriate to do it now rather than in 6 months time.

However please do not expect the editor to elaborate them. If the WG has =
ideas, send text, either by individual author drafts, or by the mailing =
list.=20

Then, why did we do KPML?

I am personally not saying people should use one solution instead of =
another. I think the issue is that the market has seen a need for =
out-of-band transport of DTMF tones, one reason being that all entities =
using DTMF do not have access to the media. If you don't agree to that =
requirement I think this is the wrong place to discuss it :)

Hi,=20

A small addition regarding the =

: wouldn't you have exactly the same problem no matter whether you use =
INFO, RFC2833 or some other mechanism to transport the DTMF tones?

>=20

Regarding the P-Called-Party header, there already IS an RFC describing =
the header, and what it is used for. So, IF it already solves the =
problem (RFC3455 does say that the header is used to convey the AOR to =
the UAS), why would we need a separate draft? The only additional =
information that a draft could contain are the use-cases where receiving =
the AOR is important - but those use-cases are solution independent and =
already described in Jonathan's draft.

Of course, if we want to define a NEW header, or a NEW URI parameter, =
that may be done in a separate draft.

But, no matter how we do it, I think the author should at least indicate =
whether he has already thought about the alternatives that have been =
presented, and why he thinks that they don't work.

Regards,

Christer

[JRE] KPML addresses a different problem space, i.e., an application =
server that doesn't necessarily have any audio and/or DTMF capability.

[JRE] KPML addresses this space.  Because it establishes a dialog for =
the purpose, KPML can ensure that SIPS is used, even if SIPS is not used =
for the INVITE-initiated dialog. Why do we need a different solution?

The problem is that the INFO solution was implemented BEFORE KPML was =
finalized.

I also believe that many people think it's easier do handle it in a =
single dialog, without having to establish and associate two separate =
ones. But, that's just my guessing (I have personally never had to make =
the decisson which solution to implement based on technical arguments).

Christer

Christer,

For clarification, does the P-Called-party header field URI get =
overwritten when retargeting (as opposed to routing) occurs? If not, I =
fear it suffers from the same problem as the To header field URI, as =
described in Jonathan's draft.

I believe it does work with retargeting.

In fact, chapter 4.2 of RFC3455 pretty much describes the same =
retargeting problem when using the To header as Jonathan does in his =
draft.

Christer,=20
I think I'm starting to see your point...

It sounds to me as if you are saying something equivalent to the =
following:
INFO is a notification for some type of implicit subscription on an =
INVITE dialog.
(geez, I hope my interpretation doesn't sound stupid)

For example, instead of establishing a new dialog for receiving DTMF =
notifications, the INFO is used in order to send events on the INVITE =
dialog without requiring a new subscription usage on the dialog =
(meaning, the implicit subscription ends with the BYE, unlike explicit =
subscriptions which are a different usage).

Is this interpretation acceptable?

Only thing part I feel is missing is actually stating which =
"subscriptions" the UAs want to receive/support and the previous =
discussion on content-type vs. another header to indicate the purpose of =
the INFO message.


If DTMF on INFO does become a known RFC, I think for the very least it =
should adopt the body from the KPML syntax rather than a proprietary =
one, but that's another issue.

Gilad

If you start down this path (I'd rather not), then rather than 
considering INFO to be a notification of an implicit subscription you 
might was well use NOTIFY for an implicit subscription. Just as there is 
a lot of use of INFO in the wild, there is also a lot of use of NOTIFY 
without SUBSCRIBE. I find it pretty difficult viewing INFO as an 
implicit NOTIFY.

   If you start down this path (I'd rather not), then rather than 
   considering INFO to be a notification of an implicit subscription you 
   might was well use NOTIFY for an implicit subscription.

In particular, NOTIFY is labeled with an event-type, so the recipient
knows whether or not it knows how to process the event.

Why would you think Emergency communications systems would not register?

I think we have cross domain issues, but a UA in an ECS registers with a
registrar in that ECS domain.  The caller registers with a registrar in its
domain.

I don't see a problem with the proposed solution.  I think it will work.

I never said that I endorse it...

Neither am I saying that INFO is implicit NOTIFY. I'm saying INFO's
functionality is notification on INVITE dialog usage without
subscription.

I agree it's an odd way to look at it (hence my comment on stupidity),
but here is the analogy (bear with me):
Suppose an implementation requires information during the lifetime of
the INVITE dialog, something related to the call itself. The normal way
of doing this is implementing an event package, something that holds the
call-id, remote-tag and local-tag of the INVITE dialog to which it
references.
One could say that this is a lot of work, why not send the information
on the INVITE dialog itself? Hence INFO roles into the game.
It _does_ the same functionality from user's perspective. Implementers
will find it much easier to do and it seems as a legitimate method for
communicating this information.

Of course it's not possible to say which INFO messages to receive as
opposed to event notification which are specified in the subscription.
Hence the implicit subscription (or lack of explicit subscription).
Furthermore, as Dale pointer out, there is nothing similar to Event
header, only the content-type tells what type of notification is this. I
already said this is a problem with INFO, but some disagree and say that
content-type is enough to hold the same information.

That's at least my understanding of what's proposed here:
KPML provides information on DTMF events that occur during the lifetime
of the INVITE dialog. The events are sent in NOTIFY and the event
package itself refers to the invite dialog with call-id, remote-tag and
local-tag. One could say that the same information can be passed in INFO
and it's easier to implement. No one subscribes to this information,
somehow the subscription is implicit.

If the logic of the analogy is correct, I think it has implications on
INFO.

Hello: The notion of STARTTLS-like functionality in SIP has been
mentioned on the list many times, in conjunction with end-to-
end authentication that goes beyond the hob-by-hop model of sips. 
draft-gurbani-sip-sipsec-00 explored a possible way to accomplish
this, without dvelving into too much of the details.

The latest revision (-01) provides more details on the mechanism.
A review of the draft and any comments would be much appreciated
by the authors.

Until it becomes available in the archives, you can get a copy
from:

Vijay,

An initial comment: it seems wasteful to keep all proxies that are used to 
discover a path towards the UAS in the path of all signaling, acting as 
pass-throughs. Rather, there should be some mechanism to keep only the 
proxies that are needed to traverse NAT boundaries (e.g. those with an 
outbound flow towards the UAS)

I imagine a two-phase approach: CONNECT as you have, let proxies that "know" 
they need to stay in Record-Route, then send a second CONNECT across the 
discovered Route

Also, I would suggest to make CONNECT a well formed SIP request (possibly 
with dummy values). That would allow current proxies to participate in phase 
1 of CONNECT without change (although they might Record-Route since CONNECT 
would be an unknown method - would need to strip such proxies from the 
discovered Route, e.g. by mandating a special tag to use for R-R for proxies 
that know what they're doing, removing all other entries)

Regards,
Jeroen

Hi Gilad,

I hear what you are saying, and if you really want to compary INFO to =
implicit NOTIFY, you should also remember that in some cases INFO =
messages will be sent in both directions, so doesn't that mean you would =
have TWO subscriptions (one for each direction)? But, in order to avoid =
unecessary discussions I agree with Paul that we  shouldn't continue =
onto that path :)
=20
A couple of other comments, though:

First, you say "Of course it's not possible to say which INFO messages =
to receive". If you indicate which content types you support, you know =
what you COULD receive in INFO (if someone sends you something you =
haven't indicated support for it's a protocol error).

Second, in an earlier mail you said that if we want to use INFO we =
should still use the XML format as specified in KPML. The INFO =
implementations I've seen do not use XML. E.g. Cisco seems to simply =
send something like "Signal=3D 1 Duration=3D 160". I am not sure, but I =
think there was a draft on that a long time ago. Personally I think't =
it's a little "overkill" to send an XML body just in order to provide a =
DTMF digit (and possibly additional duration information). But, as some =
people say about SIP messages: size doesn't matter :)

Regards,

Christer

I agree there are cases where there are 2 actual subscriptions. One =
unfortunate implication of this implicit subscription.
I don't think we should draft a proposal for implicit subscription - =
certainly not. I fear we are already on that path. We went on that path =
as soon as INFO was allowed. We just didn't say so, but effectively we =
implemented this functionality. If I'm right then I cannot understand =
how one can oppose implicit subscriptions and endorse extended usage of =
INFO at the same time. If I'm wrong it means that there is some kind of =
additional functionality of INFO which I missed.
I prefer that someone would show me what's basically wrong with the =
analogy or my conclusions instead of why implicit subscriptions are a =
bad idea.

Yeah, it possible, same discussion as before regarding content-type and =
info type applies.

I don't like the idea that multiple formats will be defined in RFCs for =
the same functionality. Maybe it's just me, but I think that in this =
case "the more that merrier" does not apply.

But MIME types aren't just defined for SIP. There's a whole slew of
protocols that can use any of the thousands of definede MIM types for
millions of different reasons. SIP is just one protocol among many.

But what happens when your GSM phone receives a JPEG image? How about
when it receives a Symbian executable stored in a ZIP file?

Well, we agree it's broken. We're just debating the mechanism, and
whether it's worth fixing. You and I seem to think it's worth fixing,
others would just rather say "If it hurts' don't do it!".

Once again, content types are defined more broadly than SIP.

Not at all. I've said we need a registry of usage contexts that defines
what specific content types and dispositions mean within that context
usage. Lacking that, the safe thing is not to use INFO. I think Paul has
said exactly the same thing, and that's pretty much what Jonathan has
said -- although I think Jonathan is leaning more towards the "since
defining these usages is hard, let's not use INFO" model.

I agree quite completely on this interpretation of the problem with INFO.

Hi,=20

>Why would you think Emergency communications systems would not
register?

My understanding is that in many countries they are connected more like
network equipment than user equipment, so in those cases they may not
always register.

(And, of course, if the ECS is in the PSTN it won't register, since the
MGC does not register.)

But, I am not an expert on this, so maybe I'm wrong. But, it's not
really relevant for the problem we are trying to solve, so we don't need
to discuss it futher within that context.

Regards,

Christer

No, it really means SUBSCRIBE, but I think it's a little confusing. Perhaps:

	Typically, a SUBSCRIBE request is issued by the subscriber
         whenever it needs a subscription to be installed, periodically
         refreshed or terminated.

Yes, the details in PUBLISH are a bit different. Do you have better 
wording in mind?

Entity-tag for one. Added:

	...meta-information related to a resource, e.g., its current
  	entity-tag value.

Don't understand what you mean by "multiple documents". What use-case do 
you have in mind?

Yes, this was considered, but rejected as there is currently no use for 
it in the 2xx. The way the "Suppress-Notify-If-Match" condition works is 
that a) the etag is the same and a 204 response is generated and b) the 
etag has changed and a NOTIFY is generated, which includes the new etag 
in SIP-ETag.

There is nothing specific to subnot-etags in this case.

The server basically has two choices. Either it generates an etag for 
the empty document, and as a publication is received, changes that etag 
to a new value; or the server treats the empty document as some sort of 
floor value, gives it a constant etag value, in which case a subscriber 
that fetched an empty document once, would never get an update in case 
it happened to fetch again when there was no active publication.

Either option is completely an implementation detail.

Cheers,
Aki

I don't think we need to say very much about different content types
themselves. Because, again, the transport data itself is not directly
related to the SIP session, but to the application above.

I think we should focus more on whether we need some generic rules when
sending application data over SIP, e.g. Whether some content disposition
values are not allowed etc.

I don't know - I've only had my phone for a few months, so I'm still in
the how-to-use-the-phone-book stage :).=20

But, in any case, I think that is a question for the people implementing
the phone applications, and not for the people specifying the protocol
used to transport the image.

That's probably because people have different opinions about what needs
to be defined and registered. I still think that we do NOT need to
register how the applications work and what they are actually going to
do with the application data sent/received over SIP.

I'm a little closer to the Jonathan position. I don't necessarily object 
to clarifying the use of INFO for some purpose, if that is the best way 
to do something.

But in the case of DTMF work was already done. INFO was proposed and 
rejected in favor of SUB/NOT. Somebody has to make a case that the 
existing solution isn't good enough, and that another one is needed.

Now I know that INFO is in use out there, by products of my own company 
among others. Those are *legacy* things. AFAIK they were done before the 
KPML solution was devised. We don't necessarily standardize them just 
because they are out there. People will implement them as needed.

It really depends on what you mean by "good enough". It's not always the
technically best solution that "wins".=20

Thanks to the porn industry VHS "won" over Betamax, eventhough Betamax
was supposed to be technically superior, and the SIP industry seems to
(I don't have numbers to back that up, but it is the impression I have
got) have chosen INFO over KPML :)=20

Whether it's because of compability issues, or because it's more simple
to implement and deploy (it's not only about your local parser, but also
issues related to having separate dialogs etc), or whether people don't
think that DTMF sending fits the event subscription concept in the first
place, or whether KPML simply was the right thing at the wrong time, I
don't know.

The problem is that it seems like the number of implementations is still
growing. It's becoming a de facto standard.

But, no matter what we do with DTMF, I still support the idea to look
into whether we somehow clarify the generic usage of INFO.

Christer

There is a big difference between specific additional uses, defined on a 
one-by-one basis, and *generic* usage.

I don't know how to view generic usage as anything but an explicit move 
to support SIP as a tunneling protocol. And I think that is something 
that many people here *don't* want it to become.

Opening it that way would pose many of the same issues that the 
Service-ID did.

I see what Gilad is saying and think its a useful way to think about  
the space (at least when SIP-T like problems are trying to use INFO).
(and that does not mean I like it or that I think we should promote  
anything like implicit subscriptions going forward - quite the opposite)
Mostly, it gives us a good place to look for how we recommend we  
solve those particular problems.

Thanks for sharing that insight Gilad!

That could be an optimization to consider.  As I see it, there
are three network topologies where this would be useful:

  1) IETF rfc3261-type ecosystems: I suspect that here we'll have
   two, at most three proxies in such ecosystems; so such an
   optimization can be avoided.

  2) IMS-type ecosystems: Given the high number of intermediaries
   that will field a request, the optmization may be helpful
   here.

  3) P2P-type ecosystems: If recursive routing is being used to
   reach the peer, the optimization may be helpful here as well.

The current draft does not limit the headers that can appear
in a CONNECT request.  From intermediary transaction idenitification
point of view, only a Via is needed.  Dialog usage that requires
To, From and Call-ID is an endpoint function, and in this case,
the endpoint has other means to establish that dialog (i.e., set
up the TLS tunnel and then send a dialog-establishing request over
it.)

Would not the current option tag suffice?

Thanks,

I'd argue we already used that can of worms for fishing when we did  
RFC 3265. Event packages provide a nice way of using SIP as a  
transport protocol, wrapped up with nice safety padding so one is  
less likely to hurt one's self using them and so that the application  
using the transported data is properly isolated from the SIP state  
machine.

The real question is whether there's a real requirement to do the  
same thing for INFO.

As has been pointed out, it's possible to do anything that you can do  
with INFO by doing a set of subscriptions (possibly MANY  
subscriptions) in parallel to an INVITE dialog usage. Especially  
since GRUU gives us a way to make the subscription endpoints the same  
as the INVITE endpoints.

So we're just talking about efficiency here, not functionality.

With what we've been talking about with INFO, it should be possible  
to declare support for many different INFO usages within a single  
INVITE dialog. This has the potential to make the INFO approach  
substantially more message-efficient than SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY, which in  
most cases is going to require at least one subscription in each  
direction, and in some cases many subscriptions in each direction.

The real question -- aside from the officially-sanctioned PSTN  
transport and the unsanctioned (and NOT GOING TO BE SANCTIONED BY  
THIS WG) DTMF are any applications being developed that need this  
sort of efficiency?

My personal feeling is that if it is available, INFO will be used.  
Sometimes wisely, sometimes unwisely. But I can imagine myriad  
applications that could usefully accompany a multimedia session with  
little snippets of data being schlepped back and forth. I can also  
imagine doing the same thing with a parallel MSRP session.

I like the direction this is headed. I have a few questions and 
observations:

There seem to be some constraints for support of sipsec that I didn't 
see mentioned explicitly:
- The UAC and each proxy must ensure that the transport used
   for the next hop is a connection-oriented, congestion-controlled
   transport. That is mentioned in the overview, but not specifically
   for the UAC and Proxy.

- For the tunneling to work I don't think there can be shared use
   of the connection. That is something special here. (In case of
   SCTP, I guess it would be sufficient to reserve a stream.)

There are some things that is is desirable to do that may be hard with 
sipsec, or at least need to be figured out. A couple that come to mind are:
- best effort security
- forking

For best effort security, one option seems to be to delay the CONNECT 
until you know the capabilities of the callee. For instance, a session 
could be established with SIP or SIPS, including supported:sipsec. If 
the session is established, then it could be followed up with a 
CONNECT/Replaces.

If you want to call an AOR that results in forking, CONNECT doesn't seem 
to work very well. I This may be a good reason to replace forking at a 
proxy with redirect. The proxy could return 3xx with the alternatives, 
which might be either SIP, SIPS, or SIPSEC. There are a lot of details 
to work our for this.

	Thanks,
	Paul

My understanding (maybe it's because of my background in H.248) of an
subscribed event is that something somewhere triggers an event which I
have requested to be informed about.

In most cases I don't think that sending DTMFs between two SIP entities
fits that concept. If two applications are exchaning data I don't
understand why I, as the caller, have to tell the other party to send me
a registration so that I can send him the data. The subscription is not
used in order to be informed about detected events, but in order to be
able to send data.

BUT, if I e.g. control a media server using SIP, I could use an event
registration to request to be informed about DTMFs detected on a media
stream. In that case the DTMF may not be seen as data exchanged between
two applications (and may not even be directly associated with another
SIP dialog), but more as an indication.

But, maybe that's more of a conceptual discussion than functional...

Exactly - subscriptions which you MAY end up never using, but which in
many cases still will consume SOME resources.

I am sure all mechanisms we define have their pros and cons, and it's
difficult for us to say that a specific application must use a specific
mechanism etc. Our job is to define the tools for the application
developers, and hopefully they will then be able to choose the most
efficient tool, based on the characteristics, efficiency etc of the
tools.

And, I doubt anyone would use INFO for a real-time chat type of
applications, with lots of relatively small messages, since it would
overload intermediates. But, it's difficult for us to draw a clear line
on what people can do and can't.

Regards,

Christer

A large well known company with a colorful flag already uses MESSAGE 
within a dialog for this. The performance implications would be 
identical with INFO.

Ok, so I guess someone WOULD use something similar for reat-time chat :)
I don't remember what the MESSAGE RFC says about it.

One question is: was MSRP available, and support deployed, when this
company implemented it?

Regards,

Christer

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

I'm having some second toughts on the idea of defining new error
responses for "SIPS Not Allowed" and "SIPS Not Supported" instead of
3XX.

The rationale was the semantic was somewhat different, and that=20
it would avoid the problems of proxies that "automatically recurse on
3XX".

However, now I'm thinking that 4XX may actually introduce a bigger
problem.

Because of HERFP, the new 4XX response codes are likely to be swalloed
by
proxies that do not support this specification. Which means the request
will not be resent, causing a "hard failure" if no other branch
responds.

Using a 3XX on the other hand has a much greater chance of working
through
HERF since they tend to be forwarded. (Of course, they may suffer from
the
problem caused by proxies that are too keen on recursing).

Comments?

You do not tell the other party to send registration so you can send him
data. The other party asks for this data and you send it or vise versa.

Some of us are saying that the lack of ability in SIP to state which
INFO messages each ends wants to receive, it is a major drawback. As
long as new RFCs don't focus on INFO, this problem is usually limited,
but if we use INFO more broadly it's a real issue.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean, but it sounds to me as if you
are describing a solution to the issue of specifying which INFOs are
required.=20

And if it would have been possible to subscribe to many different event
packages in a single message, would that be an equivalent solution?

>=20

Right. Currently if extended usage of INFO is needed, it's not well
defined and there are several problems to resolve.

We might have been taking this conversation to the wrong direction.
If some feel that SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY might be too complex in some
situations, I think we should discuss it outside the context of INFO.
INFO is just one solution to this problem. If the best solution in this
case would turn out to be INFO, we will be more motivated to fix its
problems.

I don't see a reason to "reverse engineer" a proprietary solution that
some vendors took that involved INFO at the time. We need a problem
definition. Whether or not the end solution will be similar to the
vendor's solution is irrelevant.

Well, personally, I might. I think that MESSAGE could well have been an
INFO usage. Instead, we developed a protocol extension that confused
what was happening  at the SIP level (transport) with an application
function (Presenting data to the user). It was bad design.

Once all the proxies that don't have to be there for something like NAT
traversal have dropped out, the only intermediaries being loaded are the
ones that need to be loaded in order to make the communication work at
all. When one brings in the performance gains of SIPSEC (proxies no
longer parse, decrypt, or encrypt messages once a CONNECT completes),
it's actually a pretty efficient approach.

SIP WG

Here is a new ID I've written because of implementation 
considerations to allow a SIP Resource-Priority header (RPH) in 
responses, which RFC 4412 currently disallows, assuming only that 
stateful devices will use RPH.  There have been many requests to have 
this "only stateful devices" restriction relaxed, in certain 
scenarios.  This ID does this, and proposes how IANA is changed 
accordingly wrt RPH.  This ID does nothing else.

Comments are appreciated.

Subject: Nomcom 2007-8: First Call for Volunteers

Folks,

If you have attended 3 out of the past 5 IETF meetings, you are  
eligible to
serve on Nomcom 2007-2008.  Please volunteer and you may become one  
of the
voting members of the committee that selects about half of the  
members to the
IESG and IAB and one IAOC member.  RFC 3777 describes the process and  
the
responsibilities in detail.  Below is the list of people from the  
IESG, IAB and
IAOC whose terms end during the March 2008 IETF meeting.

IAOC:

Ed Juskevicius

IAB:

Leslie Daigle
Elwyn Davies
Kevin Fall
Olaf Kolkman
David Oran
Eric Rescorla

IESG:

Lisa Dusseault -- Applications Area Director
Jari Arkko -- Internet Area Director
Dan Romascanu -- Operations and Management Area Director
Cullen Jennings -- Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area  
Director
Ross Callon --- Routing Area Director
Sam Hartman -- Security Area Director
Magnus Westerlund -- Transport Area Director

Before volunteering, please think about whether you want to be  
considered for
one of those positions instead.  If you are already convinced, please  
send an
email before 12:00 noon ET (16:00 UTC/GMT) on July 5, 2007  
(otherwise, please
read on)

To: ldondeti@qualcomm.com
Subject: Nomcom 2007-8 Volunteer
Body:

<Your Full Name>   // As you enter in the IETF Registration Form,
                            // First/Given name followed by Last/ 
Family Name
<Current Primary Affiliation> // typically what goes in the Company  
field
                                           //  in the IETF  
Registration Form
[<all email addresses used to Register for the past 5 IETF meetings>]  
<Preferred
email address>  //
<Telephone number>         // For confirmation if selected

Please expect an email response from me within 1-2 days stating  
whether you are
qualified or not.  If you don't receive anything, please re-send your  
email with
the tag (duplicate) in the subject line.

Not convinced yet?  Please consider that nomcom members play an  
important role
in shaping the leadership of the IETF.  If you are a people person,  
you will
enjoy meeting many of the active contributors to the IETF.  If you  
prefer
instead to read a lot of email, well, we have that too.  Being a  
nomcom member
is also an important responsibility: it requires adherence to  
confidentiality
rules and some time commitment from the members.  The term begins  
just prior to
the Chicago meeting and we expect most of the work to be completed by  
January
2008.  During this period, the nomcom members

-- collect requirements from the community and interviews candidates
      during the Chicago and Vancouver IETF meetings
-- review candidates' statements and weighs community feedback
-- participate in candidate selection deliberations (weekly conferences
calls)

Nomcom members are selected following a publicly verifiable random  
selection
method specified in RFC 3797.

For the nomcom to work as it should, the pool from which the  
volunteers are
chosen should be as large as possible. The more people who volunteer,  
the better
chance we have of choosing a random yet representative cross section  
of the IETF
population.

Ensuring the leadership of the IETF is fair and balanced and  
comprised of those
who can lead the IETF in the right direction is an important  
responsibility that
rests on the IETF participants at large.  Volunteering for the nomcom  
is a good
way of contributing in that direction.  So please volunteer!

thanks,
Lakshminath

>-       applicability - does it identify and solve a problem?

I think it does. A specific case it simplifies is coordination of 
access control in federations.

>-       completeness - is there something missing?

I'm personally missing scenarios which
- use redirection as opposed to proxy mode. IMO, it is beneficial to have
  the AS operated in 3xx mode for better scalability. 
- use SAML-by-value, in addition to SAML-by-reference. I personally find
  the SAML-by-reference quite non-real-time and harder-to-scale too.
Perhaps there are arguments why proxy+by/reference is the best thing, but
if that's the case I think they should be mentioned in the document.

Other things have been tracked but the debates are IMO not yet visible
in the spec:
- reference of the SAML document to some parts of the initial SIP request
  so that it is harder to replay SAML permisssions (issue #5)
- backwards compatibility with Identity-info (#12)
- the by-value scenarios is here actually too .. (#9)

   From: Jonathan Rosenberg <jdrosen@cisco.com>

   THe mechanism basically changes the way proxies handle requests. Instead 
   of rewriting the request URI for out-of-dialog requests, they'll push a 
   route header and leave the r-uri alone. This allows the original R-URI 
   and any parameters it contains to get delivered to the UAS.

Unfortunately, I have to say that I dislike this mechanism intensely,
as it changes the whole philosophy of how SIP messages are routed.

On a more practical level, it only deals with one level of address
mapping, and it's not usable by a UA that doesn't implement the change
-- whereas I would expect that the optimal mechanism is one that
tweaks the behavior of the proxy doing the mapping, and requires no
change from any other system.

Who am I?  My name is Eric.  I have a problem.  I am on the road to
recovery...

Yes, I am responsible for RFC 4722, which, as a side effect, instructs
people on the THEN state-of-the-art (pre-SUB/NOT) of how to transport user
stimulus that HAPPENS to be key presses on a key pad using INFO messages.

As a side note, 90% of the time, we are really talking about real DTMF
detection, extracted from G.711, at a media server.

I am also responsible for RFC 4730, KPML, which instructs people on the
CURRENT state-of-the-art of how to transport user stimulus using SUBSCRIBE
and NOTIFY.

Note the key [sic] phrase: "transport user stimulus."

There were some suggestions to use RFC 2833 / 4733 to transport DTMF.  I
would offer, if your goal is to TRANSPORT IN-BAND TONES THAT HAPPEN TO BE
DTMF, your ONE and ONLY ONE option is RFC 4733.  You are *transporting*
media; use a media transport protocol.

If your goal is to TRANSPORT USER *SIGNALING*, your ONE and ONLY ONE option
is RFC 4730, KPML.  We have seen tons and tons of reasons why INFO is "bad."
I would offer that INFO is simply underspecified.  Namely, the remedy is to
fix the "why am I getting this message and what am I supposed to do with it"
question.  Event: and Content-Type: do this for NOTIFY.  A similar mechanism
could be done for INFO (note the deliberate use of passive voice).

Since we do not seem to have pressure to add those facilities to INFO, I
would offer we get on with life.

I cringe every time someone says, "The only acceptable use for INFO is for
ISUP."  ALL of the arguments that apply to "One cannot use INFO for foo"
apply to why "One cannot use INFO for ISUP."

The INFO method is NOT to "carry [arbitrary] mid-session information between
SIP user agents" as RFC 2976 posits.  The one and only one reason one can
use INFO for ISUP today is because the method is ONLY defined for ISUP.

Said another way: the identifier 0x49 0x4E 0x46 0x4F has *NOTHING* to do
with INFO.  It would have much better been called 0x4E 0x53 0x55 0x50
(ISUP).

For legacy reasons, and because we really are talking about a bunch of bits,
not English, I would not offer we change the name of the method.  However, I
would make it clear that the method is NOT the general purpose method
described in RFC 2976.

IMHO, this whole thread is threatening.  Think of this analogy:
   SIP:3GPP::MIME:SIP-MIME

We are going WAY down the slippery slope of defining something that looks
like MIME, but is not MIME.  This is bad.  Or evil.  It depends on your
disposition [sic].

If you want to know how that feels, what is your visceral response to
Service Indicator?  Well, that is how the MIME community responds to
proposals that say, "we'll take MIME, but have it operate differently, but
call it MIME."  I know, no matter what we do here, there will be a 3GPP-MIME
:-(

For example, RFC 3204, referenced by the draft, is NOT the normative
reference for the handling parameter.  RFC 3204 describes SIP-ISUP
interworking.  It happens to describe a SIP-specific handling parameter.
RFC 3459 is the normative reference for the handling parameter, which
includes its use in SIP, as well as general-purpose MIME.  I would offer the
description for the motivation for the handling parameter in RFC 3459 is
more relevant to SIP today than the description in 3204.  [As a historical
note, the text for RFC 3459 pre-dates RFC 3204 by 2 years, but had a stupid
dependency on another document that didn't pop until 2003.  That was my
fault.]

I do NOT buy the argument there are too many broken implementations to do
the right thing.  In that case, jettison the whole MIME infrastructure and
build something you like (any takers for XCAP?).  Do the right thing now,
and say, "MIME is MIME."  You even get some benefits, like a bunch of open
source MIME implementations that one can use, rather than hacking these
implementations to do SIP-specific stuff.

1. if you can parse MIME, you can handle multipart/mixed with only a single
body part.

2. SIP has had MIME for a very long time.  I know an implementation that
handled multipart/mixed since 2001 ;-)

3. If your UAS can handle MIME, but not multipart/* with a single
attachment, then it is your UAS *implementation* that is broken.

4. Saying "SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT, ... have a single body part in a
multipart/*" is senseless.  If it is MIME, it certainly MAY have a single
body part.  The correct answer is:

   Therefore, this document RECOMMENDS UAs NOT use a 'multipart'
   body when there is only one body part.  This document RECOMMENDS
   UACs NOT nest one 'multipart/mixed' within another unless
   there is a need to reference the nested one (i.e., using the Content
   ID of the nested body part).  This document RECOMMENDS UAs
   NOT nest one 'multipart/alternative' within another.

One might want to put text in describing why we recommend that.  Namely, it
is wasteful in network resources and CPU resources as the recipient.

To be clear, RFC 2046 allows a multipart to have a single sub-part, so if we
do MIME, we allow single sub-parts.

Allowing multiple multipart/alternative sub-parts with the same content type
is very subtle.  The direct answer is, "no, one may not have identical
alternatives."

The subtlety is that one CAN have two multipart/alternative sub-parts with
the same Content-Type base.

For example, I can have (stealing liberally from RFC 2046):

     Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=42
     Content-ID: <id001@guppylake.example.com>

     --42
     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

     My badly formatted alternative.

     --42
     Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=local-file;
                  name="/u/nsb/writing/rfcs/RFC-MIME.ps";
                  site="thumper.example.com";
                  expiration="Fri, 14 Jun 2008 19:13:14 -0400 (EDT)"

     Content-type: application/postscript
     Content-ID: <id42@guppylake.example.com>

     --42
     Content-Type: message/external-body;
                  access-type=mail-server
                  server="listserv@example.net;
                  expiration="Fri, 14 Jun 2008 19:13:14 -0400 (EDT)"

     Content-type: application/postscript
     Content-ID: <id42@guppylake.example.com>

     get RFC-MIME.DOC

     --42--


Notice that two of the alternatives are message/external-body with types
application/postscript.  However, the parameters of the
multipart/alternative Content-Type are different, rendering the
Content-Types different.

So, if the question is can I have two alternatives of type "mumble/foo", the
answer is, "Yes, you may.  For example, Content-Type: mumble/foo;param1=bar
and Content-Type: mumble/foo:param1=foobar are the same type but different
contents"  If the question is can I have two alternatives that are the
*identical* content type, like "mumble/foo;param1=bar" and "mumble/fool;
param1=bar", then the answer is, "No, you may not."

Just as in SIP, the MIME process needs to be able to determine if or how to
handle a given body part purely from inspecting the headers.

Going a step further: if SIP goes beyond the standard MIME processing, I
would offer that rather than use the hammer of the 1990's (MIME), we move to
the hammer of the 2000's (XML).

I do not think one can say what the Content-Disposition of a multipart/*
body part should be.  From RFC 2183:

   If a Content-Disposition header is used on a multipart body part, it
   applies to the multipart as a whole, not the individual subparts.
   The disposition types of the subparts do not need to be consulted
   until the multipart itself is presented. When the multipart is
   displayed, then the dispositions of the subparts should be respected.


We already have a compatible-with-MIME solution.  Mark the
Content-Disposition of the multipart/* as render, session, or inline with
the needed handling parameter, and have the Content-Disposition of the
sub-parts be whatever they really need to be (if not render).  The logic is
simply to say what you mean.  It really is just a suggestion.  If we are
talking about a multipart/alternative describing sessions, then the
Content-Disposition should be session.  Of course, you could have
Content-Disposition be foobar (or, better yet, inline), so long as (1) the
UAS does not barf and (2) the real Content-Dispositions are present on all
of the sub-parts.

How about this:

This document describes why the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO
method, introduced in RFC 2976, has serious issues with any use outside its
use as a transport mechanism for ISDN User Part (ISUP) call signaling in
SIP-signaled networks.  In the years since the introduction of the INFO
method, the IETF has published numerous, interoperable extensions to SIP.
This document explains why there are INFO-based, proprietary protocols in
the wild; the flaws of using INFO; and prescriptions for how to use
existing, interoperable SIP mechanisms to accomplish most any of these
tasks.


My personal preference is for the document to be Standards Track and be a
Work Group chartered item.  The reason is that for this document to be
useful, it MUST update RFC 2976.  If it updates RFC 2976, then newbies get
the pointer when the download RFC 2976, pointing them to this document,
before they go off, create draft-mumble-foo-over-INFO, and get flamed on the
list.  The essence of the normative content of the document is, "one MUST
NOT use INFO for anything other than transporting ISUP or QSIG messages."

Because the normative content is so thin, I could understand not saying that
and making the document Informational (or BCP).  However, I really and truly
believe that will significantly reduce the impact the document will have.


Outline:
Introduction
- Requirements for UA-to-UA signaling
- The INFO method
- The INFO method for ISUP signaling
Issues with INFO
- No or incomplete negotiation
- No real identification of payload purpose on receipt
Alternatives to INFO
- State Updates: SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY
- DTMF Transport: KPML (an example of state updates)
- Establishment of direct UA-to-UA signaling channel: MRCPv2, MSRP
- Prescriptions for deciding which method is appropriate under what
circumstances
Update to RFC 2976
- Limiting use of INFO to ISUP transport only
Security Considerations

Hi,

I just had a quick review of the SIP-SAML activities. I found mostly
nits, which ware below, the draft generally seems mature to me.
- 1 Introduction (page 3)
   maybe it is worth mentioning in the introduction already that this ID
only=20
   considers "call by reference" for the assertions and does not provide
means for=20
   sending the assertion directly.
- 3.1 SAML assertions (page 7)
   "Explaining how the assertion was made, for example. " Sounds like an
example would follow,=20
   which does not. I suggest removing "for example"
- 4 Specification scope  (page 9), in the discussion paragraph:
   "However, The ..." -> should be "However, the ..."
   "participating entites ..." -> "participating entities ..."
- 5. Emplying SAML in SIP (page 11)
  "seperatey" -> "separately"
- 6.1.2 Profile Overview (page 14)
  "Although this profile is overview is cast in terms of a SIP INVITE
..." There is something wrong with this sentence
- 6.1.3.2 (page 19)
  procedes -> proceeds

Ciao

good catch, actually the current xcap-diff format requires at least one
document update (but it should be fixed), so either of your proposals
should work.

This is not defined in xcap-diff format, as it is sort of an error case
with documents. With xcap-component subscription it is somewhat vague.=20
When etags are included, you could e.g. do a conditional replace based
on them. So perhaps it is better to add etags always, certainly I don't
want any negotiations about this.

Good question. I could do a counterquestion, why did OMA do that, and
instead let the implementations figure these out ? I mean this
introduces a lot of complexity and several difficult error cases. But
the intention here (in the i-d) is to do what is typical in the ietf,
i.e. just to define the interface and let the implementations do the
rest. But back to the question, the i-d says that you send in the
initial notify request what you can "read", so probably you could still
compose this from separate responses from several xdms, as results from
different auids should be orthogonal. But hey, I really wouldn't
personally like to implement it ;-).

While using "pending" I was wandering that I'll produce somewhat

In practice, I wouldn't anticipate that you would need this empty body
or neutral body notify, i.e. clients will most likely keep the state
information based on the response of subscribe. But the spec allows to
use it although null body interpretation with content-type header _is_
interesting.

The latter, after sending the http reference, the server does not know
when the client has really read the content, thus no aggregation allowed
with "rapidly changing resources"

[Sofie wrote:]
I see aggregation as very useful in conjuction with rate limitation and
throttle. An issue arrises though when a notification with aggregated
patches becomes too large. According to you the notifier should then
send all patches separately in several notifications but if rate
limitation or throttle is being used the client might never catch up.
Could it instead be the choise of the notifier if it wants to send a
notification with only the document link (content indirection) or if it
wants to send all patches separately?

thanks,
Jari

Hi,

   I would like to how T4 timer needs to be set, based on the value of T1?
If round trip delay is, say 20s, then T1 needs to be set to 20s. To what
value should T4 timer, needs to be set now? Should T4 needs to be
set as (Actual value of T1)*(default value of T4/ default value of T1)? If
yes, could you please explain the logic behind this.

Thanks,
Jagan

Betreff: Re: SIP SAML Draft Review


Hey Hannes,

I finished my review. Here are my comments:

Overall the draft is much more detailed (thus, better) than anything
I've read before on SIP/SAML.=20

My points on possible improvements to be added.

1) I believe that it would be good to leave a bit the emphasis on
authentication and providing different uses of the protocol (or, at
least, specifying that it can be used to convey attributes, query for
information, etc).=20

2) The SAML assertion profile sounds weird, although I never completely
had a complete grasp of its meaning. I understand that it is connected
with the implementation, but it never actually had any particular use to
me (or I never gave it much attention). I rather see it as details that
developers had to apply in order to have the implementation working and
must be added to the specification in order to avoid interoperability
issues.=20

3) I believe it is worth mentioning that one invalid condition locks the
whole assertion.

4) I also believe that is worth mentioning that the Identity-Info is
connected with CERTS and might go through deployment issues.=20

5) Is there something missing on 7.1? Sounded incomplete to me.

6) I believe that it is valid that together with signing part of the
message, some fields are hashed in order to improve security.

7) The part of the AS as an authenticator and proxy could be further
clarified.=20

Just some tips on how I believe it could be further improved. Again
overall the draft is very good and understandable.

Cheers

Marcos

PS: Grammar corrections (and suggestions). I've put changes under
parentheses.

* areas where the applicability to SIP (are) is widely desired.

* Employing SAML in SIP necessitates devising a new SAML profile(s) and
binding(s) because (the) those already specified in the SAMLv2=20

* specification set are specific to other use contexts (contexts of use
sound more connected with general use of the term, no?), e.g.,
HTTP-based web browsing.=20

* 6.1.  AS-driven SIP SAML URI-based Attribute ( )Assertion Fetch
Profile (Double spacing)=20

* Since the AS (is) already being trusted to create and add the Identity
header containing the SIP Identity Assertion, and to supply a pointer to
its domain certificate, having it point instead to a SAML assertion
conveying the domain certificate and possibly some user profile
attributes, does not significantly alter the first-order security
considerations examined in [RFC4474].=20

The last one was confusing to me. I re-wrote by having two sentences.

Since the (is) AS already being trusted to create and add the Identity
header containing the SIP Identity Assertion, and to supply a pointer to
its domain certificate. By having it point instead to a SAML assertion
conveying the domain certificate and possibly some user profile
attributes does not significantly alter the first-order security
considerations examined in [RFC4474].=20

* Although this profile (is) overview is cast in terms of a SIP INVITE
transaction, the reader should note that the mechanism specified herein,
and in [RFC4474], may be applied to any SIP request message.

* the randomness requir(e)ments specified in Section 1.3.4 of
[OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os].

* The value of the NotOnOrAfter XML attribute MUST be set to a time
instant later than the value for(or of?) NotBefore.

* 6.1.3.4.  Verifier Dereferences HTTP-based SAML ( )URI Reference

* the SIP SAML assertion profile specified herein (states) that the
subject's SAML assertion must adhere to causes it to be not useful to
arbitrary parties.=20

* Additionally, the assertion content dictated by the SAML assertion
profile herein ensures (or provides?) ample evidence for a relying party
to verify the assertion and its relationship with the received SIP
request.=20

Hi,
Why should be RFC's that are now 6 Years out in the world be restricted?
RFC 2976 clearly states for what INFO can be used.
I'm concerned about implementations that works with INFO regarding the =
rules defined within 2976.
Many implementations work based on that RFC. Like define a MIME, put it =
into INFO and it works.

I thought also that INFO was defined to put in some end to end =
information that shall be exchanged by UA's.
Why to restrict such a use in such a case?

If RFC 2976 will be changed is backward compatibility guaranteed?

Best Regards

Roland

Hi,

I am very concerned some some people use the word "newbies", and make it =
sound that people using INFO are beginners which have no clue about SIP.

Also, I have never heard about interoperability problems with INFO. One =
reason people are using INFO for certain things IS in order to interop =
with other implementations.

I am also confused that people seem to think that INFOs will start =
flying around for no reason, without the sender having any clue about =
whether the receiver will understand them or not. As we have discussed, =
there ARE mechanisms in SIP to negotiate what content types etc entities =
support. Yes, MAYBE we need to extend that (e.g. being able to indicate =
which methods can be used to carry a specific content type), if what we =
have is not enough. But, to me that is not the same thing has having =
"tons of problem".

Having said that, if there are issues with INFO, I have nothing against =
discussing them. But, if you are going to talk about alternative =
solutions, you also need to look at possible issues with those (having =
to set up multiple dialogs just in order to send some DTMFs associated =
with another dialog etc).=20

We can sit in our <insert-your-favorite-Hilton-hotel> meeting rooms and =
write whatever you-must-to-this-and-you-must-not-do-that documents, but =
if we don't care about the feedback we get from the real world OUTSIDE =
the meeting room it won't help much. In the long run it will cause more =
harm than good.

Regards,

Christer

Hi all,=20

Here is a review by Erkki:
=20
-----Urspr=FCngliche Nachricht-----
Von: Koivusalo Erkki (Nokia-TP-MSW/Helsinki) =
[mailto:Erkki.Koivusalo@nokia.com]=20
Gesendet: Dienstag, 12. Juni 2007 13:43
An: Tschofenig, Hannes
Betreff: RE: [Sip] draft-ietf-sip-saml-02

Hi,

Basically this is what I found before looking into the
open issues list:

---
As this draft reuses the mechanisms specified in RFC 4474
(more specifically the Identity-Info header) I am not sure=20
how implementations complying to RFC 4474 or this draft
are able to interoperate.

Is it straightforward for the recipient (UAS) of the=20
SIP request to find out whether the Identity-Info header
contains an URL pointing to the certificate of the AS
or the SAML assertion ? I assume the UAS finds it out
only from the MIME type of the HTTP response, correct ?=20

Since the UAS verification steps of RFC 4474 and=20
draft-ietf-sip-saml differ from each other, what happens=20
if UAS supporting only RFC 4474 receives an Identity-Info=20
header pointing to a SAML assertion or vice versa ?=20
Can such an UAS gracefully handle the situation and if=20
yes, how ?


    @@ TODO: do we need to define a new SIP error response code for
    when a SAML assn signature is bad? e.g., '4xx Invalid SAML
    asssertion'.

This TODO shall be resolved. To me an extra error code
would make sense.


   10.  Verify that the SAML assertion contains an <Audience> element,
        and that its value matches the value of the addr-spec of the SIP
        To header field.

How is this matching to be done ? Shall the <Audience> element
exactly the SIP URI in the To header or can it contain just a
part of it (like host part of the URI) ? The example in section 8
is like this:

  19          <Audience>
   20             example2.com
   21          </Audience>

which is not a SIP URI, so I believe either the example or the
normative text needs clarification.


Nits:

In section 6.1.2:

   Although this profile is overview is cast in terms of a SIP INVITE
   transaction

The first 'is' of the sentence sounds unnecessary.

   and also containing a the domain's (example.com) public key =
certificate

The 'a' should be removed.


The SIP URIs in Figure 2 should be checked:
- Is Alice either Alice@example.com or alice@foo.com ?
- Is Bob either bob@example.com or bob@example2.com ?
- Should the SIP URIs of both Bob and Alice or neither
  of them have sip: prefix in the figure ? Currently
  Alice does not have it (in From) while Bob has (in To).


In section 9.1.=20

      *  etc.

This 'etc' should be removed.=20
----

Regards,

Erkki

Hi Jagan
=20
Timer T4 represents the amount of time the network will take to clear
messages between client and server transactions. The default value for
T4 is 5 seconds. Also T4 is a constant and not set based on T1. For more
details refer to Sec 17.1.2.2 of RFC 3261.

Subject: [Sip] Effect of SIP T1 timer value on T4 timer


Hi,

   I would like to how T4 timer needs to be set, based on the value of
T1?
If round trip delay is, say 20s, then T1 needs to be set to 20s. To what
value should T4 timer, needs to be set now? Should T4 needs to be set as
(Actual value of T1)*(default value of T4/ default value of T1)? If yes,
could you please explain the logic behind this.=20

Thanks,
Jagan

    I haven't completely understood the definition of T4 timer. Could you
please explain it?

:-)

I hate it too - not in the abstract, but in the way it has become the 
solution to all problems. IMO it is ok as an extensible, interoperable, 
program-to-program representation of complex structured data. But it is 
not a programming language, or suitable as a user interface, and people 
should not have to write it.

Perhaps if we were starting off to do SIP/3.0 (no I'm not suggesting 
that we do that), it might make sense to use XML rather than MIME.

Given where we are, I don't think it makes sense to use XML rather than 
MIME to represent multiple independent body parts in a request.

We are *already* defining most new body parts in XML, and making them 
extensible so that they can contain other XML things. But I wouldn't go 
out of my way to start redefining mime-type as XML just so they can be 
incorporated into other XML things.

Right; modeling it on HTTP implicitly implied a congestion-controlled
transport.  With DTLS now in mix, one could conceivably consider
using a connectionless transport with similar security properties
as well.  But at least right now, we're only considering congestion
controlled transports.

Right; in the default case, since the properties of the connection
are tied to the certificates of the endpoints at each side,
sharing a connection would appear to be problematic.  Now, one
use case for sharing could be a pair of user agents that serve a
lot of  users (gateways, for instance.)  One could conceivably
consider requests for different ports to be sent over the same
tunnel.  But this is not a specific scenario we had envisioned
as a reason for the draft.

The problem with this approach would be that privacy is violated in
the session that is established before the CONNECT request; even
when h-b-h sips is used.

Right; agree.  Forking is problematic.  One way is to force the
issue with rfc3841's Request-Disposition header.  But that header
elicits a normative strength of SHOULD in the proxies, thereby
lending it an advisory mode only.  Another way is to discourage
forking for CONNECT in the draft, but allow for it to occur and
simply accept the first 200 OK, closing the connection on subsequent
ones.  Clearly something that needs to be worked out in the draft
going forward.

Thanks.

Eric,

I don't understand how to apply this to sip. 3459 defines the criterion 
for REQUIRED as:

    If the content gateway cannot pass a body part marked REQUIRED, then
    the entire message has failed.  In this case, the content gateway
    MUST take the appropriate failure action.

That makes sense for a mail gateway. (I don't know if it makes sense for 
a mail user agent.) But attempting to apply it to sip still leaves a lot 
of questions.

In particular, I can see that in a mail message the multipart bodies 
themselves are actually rendered in the sense that they are shown as 
nested containers. In sip, in general that won't be the case - much of 
the content won't be "rendered", though it may be "processed" in some 
sense. Unless we define what we mean by "processing" then I think we 
haven't finished.

Consider a few cases:

1. content-type SDP, content-disposition session;handling=required

We know what that means, if in a message where an offer or answer is 
allowed, or a preview of an offer or answer, or in an OPTIONS response.

We don't have a meaning for this in other contexts, such as SUBSCRIBE, 
NOTIFY, MESSAGE or their responses. If you were to receive the body in 
one of those, what should be done? Should that be a 415 response?

2. content-type text/plain, content-disposition render;handling=required

We know what this means in MESSAGE. What should be done in other 
requests, or in responses?

3. c-t multipart/mixed, c-d ???;handling=required
       c-t SDP, c-d session;handling=required
       c-t application/ISUP, c-d signal;handling=optional

I think this should be legal all the same places where (1) is legal.
But a recipient that doesn't understand multipart/mixed will return a 415.

I don't know what the content-disposition should be for the multipart.
I guess for mail the default of render works, because it can really be 
rendered. That doesn't make sense for sip in this case.

I have never seen an example using a multipart/mixed that included a 
content-disposition for it. AFAIK the default should be 
"render;handling=required". But for sip I don't know what it means to 
"render" a multipart.

4. c-t multipart/mixed; c-d ???;handling=required
       c-t SDP, c-d session;handling=required

This is a little silly, but seems legal. If you can handle (3) then you 
should be able to handle this. Somebody that doesn't handle the 
multipart would return 415.

5. c-t multipart/mixed; c-d ???;handling=required
       c-t multipart/mixed; c-d ???;handling=required
          c-t SDP, c-d session;handling=required

This is even sillier. But it raises more issues. If you handle (4), must 
you also handle this? If it is acceptable to handle (4) and not handle 
this, then what response should there be?

AFAIK these are questions about the application of MIME to sip, that 
don't seem to have been handled by the mail work because the issues just 
didn't come up there.

	Thanks,
	Paul

I've been looking for somebody who understands how this was intended to 
work in MIME. I guess you are that somebody.

The quote above starts with an "if". That makes sense for 
multipart/alternative. But what about a multipart/mixed where the 
individual subparts have different dispositions? We need some content 
disposition that results in the subparts being investigated in an 
appropriate way. But what would that be for sip?

Consider the SDP+ISUP case. The sdp disposition is "session" and the 
ISUP disposition is "signal". What should the disposition of the 
multipart be?

In the case of mail it seems that "render" works, because the multipart 
itself can be rendered. But that doesn't make sense for sip.

I don't fully know what "inline" means. If we interpreted it to mean 
"inline with the sip processing" then it would be reasonable.

As best I understand it, any part that does not have its own 
content-disposition header has a default that is determined in a 
context-free way, (the default disposition for content-type 
application/sdp is "session" and the for application/isup is "signal") 
and the default-default is "render". I haven't seen any indication that 
the content-disposition is ever inherited from the enclosing body.

So, unless I've missed something, the default disposition for 
multipart/* is "render". But unless we define what it means to "render" 
a multipart in sip then I think this is nonsense.

It may be that for reasons of backward compatibility we should define 
"render" for sip, at least for multipart. But that would be a bit ugly.

Hi James,

It might be useful to have some wording on the limitations of using a
response
to carry a Resource-Priority header in a response.

Specifically, a UAS can not use a response to carry the
Resource-Priority
in cases where the Resource-Priority "absolutely has" to be delivered to
the=20
UAC. It is therefore only useable for cases where a forking proxy=20
may discard the response (i.e., forward another instead) without
breaking
anything. In other words,you need to think about HEFP before using this
draft.

In some scenarios, this is probably the desired behavior.

In other scenarios, it may not acceptable. So instead, for those
scenarios,
the terminating side would have to send a new request with a
Resource-Priority=20
instead of using a response.

All the standard says is the content-disposition is inherited from the outer multipart. If you want a different disposition for a subpart, you mark it appropriately. In your examples, you would mark the SDP session and the ISUP signal. You could get away with marking the multipart as session, be silent on the SDP, and mark the ISUP as signal.  I would offer we recommend UAC's mark all body parts.

I've been looking for somebody who understands how this was intended to 
work in MIME. I guess you are that somebody.

The quote above starts with an "if". That makes sense for 
multipart/alternative. But what about a multipart/mixed where the 
individual subparts have different dispositions? We need some content 
disposition that results in the subparts being investigated in an 
appropriate way. But what would that be for sip?

Consider the SDP+ISUP case. The sdp disposition is "session" and the 
ISUP disposition is "signal". What should the disposition of the 
multipart be?

In the case of mail it seems that "render" works, because the multipart 
itself can be rendered. But that doesn't make sense for sip.

I don't fully know what "inline" means. If we interpreted it to mean 
"inline with the sip processing" then it would be reasonable.

As best I understand it, any part that does not have its own 
content-disposition header has a default that is determined in a 
context-free way, (the default disposition for content-type 
application/sdp is "session" and the for application/isup is "signal") 
and the default-default is "render". I haven't seen any indication that 
the content-disposition is ever inherited from the enclosing body.

So, unless I've missed something, the default disposition for 
multipart/* is "render". But unless we define what it means to "render" 
a multipart in sip then I think this is nonsense.

It may be that for reasons of backward compatibility we should define 
"render" for sip, at least for multipart. But that would be a bit ugly.

My preference would be to restrict the use of INFO to supporting
legacy PSTN protocols. We could even restrict it to the ones in=20
RFC 3204.

In other words, let's just cap it.

And yes, I'd say Standards track that updates RFC 2976.

Subject: Re: [Sip] MIME: Nested bodies with option-tag?

Eric,

I don't understand how to apply this to sip. 3459 defines the criterion 
for REQUIRED as:

    If the content gateway cannot pass a body part marked REQUIRED, then
    the entire message has failed.  In this case, the content gateway
    MUST take the appropriate failure action.

That makes sense for a mail gateway. (I don't know if it makes sense for 
a mail user agent.) But attempting to apply it to sip still leaves a lot 
of questions.

In particular, I can see that in a mail message the multipart bodies 
themselves are actually rendered in the sense that they are shown as 
nested containers. In sip, in general that won't be the case - much of 
the content won't be "rendered", though it may be "processed" in some 
sense. Unless we define what we mean by "processing" then I think we 
haven't finished.

Consider a few cases:

1. content-type SDP, content-disposition session;handling=required

We know what that means, if in a message where an offer or answer is 
allowed, or a preview of an offer or answer, or in an OPTIONS response.

We don't have a meaning for this in other contexts, such as SUBSCRIBE, 
NOTIFY, MESSAGE or their responses. If you were to receive the body in 
one of those, what should be done? Should that be a 415 response?

2. content-type text/plain, content-disposition render;handling=required

We know what this means in MESSAGE. What should be done in other 
requests, or in responses?

3. c-t multipart/mixed, c-d ???;handling=required
       c-t SDP, c-d session;handling=required
       c-t application/ISUP, c-d signal;handling=optional

I think this should be legal all the same places where (1) is legal.
But a recipient that doesn't understand multipart/mixed will return a 415.

I don't know what the content-disposition should be for the multipart.
I guess for mail the default of render works, because it can really be 
rendered. That doesn't make sense for sip in this case.

I have never seen an example using a multipart/mixed that included a 
content-disposition for it. AFAIK the default should be 
"render;handling=required". But for sip I don't know what it means to 
"render" a multipart.

4. c-t multipart/mixed; c-d ???;handling=required
       c-t SDP, c-d session;handling=required

This is a little silly, but seems legal. If you can handle (3) then you 
should be able to handle this. Somebody that doesn't handle the 
multipart would return 415.

5. c-t multipart/mixed; c-d ???;handling=required
       c-t multipart/mixed; c-d ???;handling=required
          c-t SDP, c-d session;handling=required

This is even sillier. But it raises more issues. If you handle (4), must 
you also handle this? If it is acceptable to handle (4) and not handle 
this, then what response should there be?

AFAIK these are questions about the application of MIME to sip, that 
don't seem to have been handled by the mail work because the issues just 
didn't come up there.

Maybe we can just do the 3XX with multiple contacts?
(i.e., UAC-based forking)?

Yes, that is a third option; although, I would be curious to
see how many user agents fork (proxies of course need to).
Most user agents that I have used happily leave the complexity
of forking to their nearest friendly proxy.

Thanks.

Because RFC 2976 is wrong, and we are willing to correct our mistakes.  Goo=
d news is that other than 3204, there are no documented standards track use=
s of INFO. There is one informational RFC that talks about its use in the w=
ild (for media server control), but if you look at it (RFC 4722) you will s=
ee the #1 reason for using info was that in the day, there was no other alt=

Given NO IETF standards use INFO, and we have been explaining why it is a b=

Subject: AW: [Sip] INFO usage (or not)

Hi,
Why should be RFC's that are now 6 Years out in the world be restricted?
RFC 2976 clearly states for what INFO can be used.
I'm concerned about implementations that works with INFO regarding the rule=
s defined within 2976.
Many implementations work based on that RFC. Like define a MIME, put it int=
o INFO and it works.

I thought also that INFO was defined to put in some end to end information =
that shall be exchanged by UA's.
Why to restrict such a use in such a case?

If RFC 2976 will be changed is backward compatibility guaranteed?

Best Regards

Roland

True. But how many UAs support sipsec? :-)

This could just be part of implementing sipsec.

I agree: in a limited deployment scenario, like an application server conne=
cted to a media server using a yellow cable as a proxy and an application b=
ought from a single systems integrator, there is no interoperability proble=
m. However, the info incompatibility problem is real - I have experienced i=
t in the wild.

You are correct in asserting that one can make INFO work - we were doing it=
 in 2001.  However, working in the Internet is a different case altoghether=

Hi,

I am very concerned some some people use the word "newbies", and make it so=
und that people using INFO are beginners which have no clue about SIP.

Also, I have never heard about interoperability problems with INFO. One rea=
son people are using INFO for certain things IS in order to interop with ot=
her implementations.

I am also confused that people seem to think that INFOs will start flying a=
round for no reason, without the sender having any clue about whether the r=
eceiver will understand them or not. As we have discussed, there ARE mechan=
isms in SIP to negotiate what content types etc entities support. Yes, MAYB=
E we need to extend that (e.g. being able to indicate which methods can be =
used to carry a specific content type), if what we have is not enough. But,=
 to me that is not the same thing has having "tons of problem".

Having said that, if there are issues with INFO, I have nothing against dis=
cussing them. But, if you are going to talk about alternative solutions, yo=
u also need to look at possible issues with those (having to set up multipl=
e dialogs just in order to send some DTMFs associated with another dialog e=
tc).=20

We can sit in our <insert-your-favorite-Hilton-hotel> meeting rooms and wri=
te whatever you-must-to-this-and-you-must-not-do-that documents, but if we =
don't care about the feedback we get from the real world OUTSIDE the meetin=
g room it won't help much. In the long run it will cause more harm than goo=
d.

Regards,

Christer

RFC 3261 section 8.1.1 states:
"A valid SIP request formulated by a UAC MUST, at a minimum, contain
   the following header fields: To, From, CSeq, Call-ID, Max-Forwards,
   and Via; all of these header fields are mandatory in all SIP
   requests.  These six header fields are the fundamental building
   blocks of a SIP message, as they jointly provide for most of the
   critical message routing services including the addressing of
   messages, the routing of responses, limiting message propagation,
   ordering of messages, and the unique identification of transactions."
Even if all these header fields are not strictly needed by entities that
support sipsec, I think we should continue to mandate them, even if they
contain dummy values. Otherwise it might have unnecessary impact on SIP
stacks or might lead to unexpected responses (e.g. 400).

John

So, why don't you explain what problems you have seen?

Because, I have seen implementations - from different vendors - working =
fine togheter.

Of course, maybe there are also implementations which do NOT interop =
widely, but they probably have been implemented without any use of the =
negotiation mechanisms etc that we have in SIP, with a very limited =
deployment scope in mind. There is not much we can do about that, but =
those kind of scenarios are not what I have been talking about.

Here is a review by Andreas Pashalidis:

----------------------

Here are a few small comments: 


"trait-based" authentication sounds a bit unconventional. 
Cannot you just talk about "attribute-based" authorization? That would be better aligned with SAML terminology. 


>From the description in section 5 and figure 1, it is not always clear
if you talk about an "authentication assertion" or an "attribute
assertion" -

Figure 2, step 5: is it possible to have multiple attribute statements
in the response? (for example, if possession of multiple attributes is
required?)

Section 6.1.4.1.4: what does it mean if there is no attribute
statement? is it an authentication assertion then? if yes, what would
be the authentication context?

Section 9.2: it would be nice to have some exaplanation there, without
having to refer to a different spec/document.

Thats all for now.

Gruss,
Andreas

John: You are absolutely right.  Miraculously, the authors of the
draft acquired selective amnesia with respect to S8.1.1 of rfc3261
when drafting the contents of the CONNECT request ;-)

This will be rectified in subsequent revisions with appropriate
view towards privacy.

Touche!  Nothing like reality biting back in the face.  ;-)

So let's think this through.  Francois suggested proxies
don't fork and return 3xx, possibly with multiple contacts
and let the UAC decide if it wants to fork.

This is certainly possible, although having implemented forking
and response aggregation in a SIP stack, I know that this is a
non-trivial amount of complexity that now every UA would have
to implement if it wants to support sipsec.

Now, one thing that we have discovered that is sub-optimal about
proxies that recurse instead of sending a 3xx to the UA is the
potential for upgrading a sip URI to sips and downgrading in
reverse.  With sipsec, such upgrading or downgrading at proxies
does not matter.  Eventually, over any transport (sip or sips)
chosen by the proxy, certs would be exchanged end-to-end.  For
this reason, it would be good if we don't force the endpoint
to support forking.

And finally, forking a non-INVITE request at a proxy should
still result in one 2xx, or a best non-2xx being returned to
the UAC.  So user agents can inherit much of the current
transaction-related behavior for CONNECT and augment it with
the certificate and tunnel behavior.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

[JRE] I just don't get how this would work. The UAC receives only one
2xx and as a result initiates one TLS handshake with the UAS concerned.
The UAC never gets to hear about any of the other forked-to UASs that
might have sent a 2xx, so can never establish a tunnel with those.

Hello,

ad 1: Now I understand the meaning correctly.

ad 4: Here I have on mind subscription to changes in documents created
using mechanism described in sip-xcap-config (formerly
sipping-config-framework). This way, client might subscribe to changes
in multiple documents e.g. under one AUID:

Event:
ua-profile;profile-type=application;auid="rls-services";Vendor="v";Model="m";Version="v"

This way all documents owned by subscriber are subscribed for changes.
If changes in multiple documents occur, the server might notify about
these changes using one notification and format described in
simple-xcap-diff. However, this way the notification carries change in
two independent resources. And the problem, if subscriber includes
"Supported: subnot-etags" then server shall include SIP-ETag header
containing actual entity value of the resource in the notification body.
How this notification can carry entity values of multiple documents?

ad 2: At the moment I have no better wording in my mind but I will still
think about it.

br, Martin

Sorry, probably i've been unclear on this. Rate limitation/throttle 
combined with patching is indeed challenging but doable. And even you 
can combine filtering here in addition to standard authorization so the 
complexity begins to be quite high (although i could say that even the 
basic authorization handling is hard enough to implement, be it on 
server or client ;-)). So the notifier must be well aware of the client 
state all the time, it is not that one could simply drop some events, so 
"throttle engine" and patching process must co-operate properly. 
However, related to patching/syncing the key issue is that after the 
notifier sends only the http references, it doesn't have the knowledge 
when the client eventually has read the  relevant resource content. So 
once the notifier does this reference sending, it fall backs into the 
"xml-patching" mode with full etag change history, i.e. aggregation 
_may_ cause similar trouble than during the initial sync. But 
subscription refresh (or versioning support in xcap  server ;-)) would 
similarly solve this.

But anyways, i think that i'll  just submit a new version with some 
clarifications (and better examples) ?
thanks, jari

There were comments received on this draft, but none of them appear to
be technical show stoppers.

Volker will update the draft, based on the comments received. If any of
these require technical discussion, he will raise the issues on the
list. I do not expect any further WGLC.

When the new version exists, I will submit a publication request to the
IESG.

For the related SIPPING drafts, these also received comments. Again none
of these are technical show stoppers. There are also some issues with
dependent references to be addressed.

Regards

Keith

By Internet, I mean a network of nodes with different implementations (vend=
ors) across different administrative domains (service providers and enterpr=
ises).  If you have a Sonus softswitch talking to a Sonus softswitch life i=
s good. If you have a Nortel softswitch talking to a Nortel softswitch life=
 is good. If you have a Cisco MGC talking to a Cisco MGC life is good.=20

If you want to mix and match, life is good for Acme and NexTone, to name a =
few.

AFAIK, only MSCML (RFC 4722) bothers to even try to negotiate content and u=
nderstanding of the INFO messages.=20

I would very quickly concede that one could fix INFO. That was the point of=
 Dean's draft.  However, I think it is way too late to go that route.

So, why don't you explain what problems you have seen?

Because, I have seen implementations - from different vendors - working fin=

Of course, maybe there are also implementations which do NOT interop widely=

I think it's way too late to start restricting the usage of INFO. I =

would have some standard ground to stand on.

Some comments on the draft...

1. I think it might be a good idea to talk something on "Referred-By" in =
this draft. Referred-By mechanism is still very useful for the multiple =
refer case. Maybe Refer-To related to a URI List with "bcc" or =
"anonymize" is a trouble. "Referred-BY=E2=80=9D in the message header is =
to identify the initial REFER-Issuer. This information may be encrypted =
together with "refer-to" URI list, including the copy control level such =
as to/cc/bcc to the end user, i.e. REFER-Target, where the information =
will be decrypted by the REFER-Target. In this case the REFER-Recipient =
won=E2=80=99t be able to get rid of the "bcc" URI from the URI list, and =
the "bcc" URI will be sent to other REFER-Targets along with normal =
to/cc. This will be a problem to destroy the blind cc function.
However, the REFER-issuer may opt to not include a Referred-By token. =
For example:
   REFER sip:conf-123@example.com;gruu;opaque=3Dhha9s8d-999a  SIP/2.0
   Refer-To: <cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com>
   Referred-By: Carol <sip:carol@chicago.example.com>
   Content-Type: application/resource-lists+xml
   Content-Disposition: recipient-list
   Content-Length: 362
   Content-ID: <cn35t8jf02@example.com>

   <?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?>
   <resource-lists xmlns=3D"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists"
           xmlns:xsi=3D"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     <list>
       <entry uri=3D"sip:bill@example.com?method=3DBYE" />
       <entry uri=3D"sip:joe@example.org?method=3DBYE" />
       <entry uri=3D"sip:ted@example.net?method=3DBYE" />
     </list>
   </resource-lists>

When the URI list has no "bcc" or "anonymize" URI, REFER-issuer may =
include the Referred-By token in the REFER body.

2. Nested refer in multiple refer is very interesting, I believe it =
could be a good idea to enroll a "multiple nested refer" example into =
this draft. Just for an example:
   REFER sip:list-service@example.com;gruu;opaque=3Dhha9s8d-999a  =
SIP/2.0
   Refer-To: <cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com>
   Content-ID: <cn35t8jf02@example.com>

   <?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?>
   <resource-lists xmlns=3D"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists"
           xmlns:xsi=3D"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     <list>
       <entry =
uri=3D"sip:bill@example.com?method=3DREFER%3FRefer-To%3Dsip:conf-123%40sh=
enzhen.example.com" />
       <entry =
uri=3D"sip:tom@example.com?method=3DREFER%3FRefer-To%3Dsip:conf-123%40she=
nzhen.example.com" />
     </list>
   </resource-lists>
In this case, the REFER-Recipient acts as a Refer List service, has the =
similar function to the MESSAGE List service, i.e. receives a REFER with =
URI-List and distributes some REFERs to each address in the URI-List.
Note that, there is only one final REFER-Target in above "nested =
multiple refer" example, not multiple REFER-Targets. In some situations, =
this convergent feature is useful.

3. I guess it might be a typo in Figure 2 "8. 200K OK", maybe you meant =
"200 OK"?

Cheers,
Qian

That is the problems with some RFC's because it is not stated for what =
they are supposed or what people intended at that former times.
And the text describing the procedures telling an other story...

We have the same problems with RFC 3323 and 3325 for privacy purposes...

Yes, that is correct.  Simplicity at the UAC (i.e., does not have
to deal with forking) at the risk of a sub-optimal rendezvous
algorithm.  I do not yet know whether this is a fair tradeoff
or not.

We could go the 4-way handshake that rfc3265 uses.  Or simply
bite the bullet as Paul and Francois suggest and mandate the UAC
to handle multiple 3xx responses and leave the choice on whether
or not to fork and how (serial, parallel) to it.

Thanks,

There are a variety of things we could do, together or separately:

1)revise 2976 to restrict INFO to standardized usages. Make any other
   usage MUST NOT.

2)establish an IANA registry for uses of INFO based on Content-Type.
   It would define what information is needed to define a usage.
   Initially populate it with the existing standardized usages.
   The criteria for adding new uses could be:
   a) Stds track RFC
   b) Informational RFC
   c) FCFS

3)establish a policy that the WG won't approve any other usages of INFO,
   beyond the existing ISUP/QSIG ones. (Then we don't need a registry.)

4)do nothing - status quo. Existing uses

IMO anything that bans the current practices (i.e. (1)) that haven't 
been standardized is futile - it won't cause them to stop. IMO we seem 
to have a significant majority in favor of (3), though apparently not a 
consensus.

So I think the realistic possibilities are (2) or (4). And (2a) is 
pretty much the same as (1) so it isn't realistic either.

One of the other variants of (2) could reflect the realities and improve 
on the current situation in that at least the existing usages would be 
documented in public.

There's no real reason you couldn't for a CONNECT. The UA is still  
going to have to decide which endpoint it upgrades to TLS. Although  
in the absence of a PKI, the connected-surprise problem could become  
an issue. This is a somewhat more tractable problem if 302 is issued,  
as the UA would only exercise contacts in the 302 which it expects to  
be able to validate.

	If the original BYE had a magic cookie, then a second BYE _without_  
it is a new transaction (the language in 3261 doesn't say this  
explicitly, but it is assumed that a UAC would not send one BYE with  
a magic cookie, and a retransmission without). Additionally, since we  
compare the topmost Via in the 2543 tid case, changing the branch  
param between the two BYEs will also cause the match to fail. This  
test case is incorrect.

Byron Campen

I agree with Dean.

In fact, that's what I tought we were talking about.

Agreed.

Basically, say the "CONNECT" ended up in 3 different directions after a
3XX with 3
contacts. The UAC would set up the end-to-end TLS connections from the
UAC to the 3
contacts.

Then the INVITEs have no intermediaries, so they can't fork.

There are also issues on whether or not the allowed/desired INFO types =
should be specified somewhere.
Furthermore, whether or not content-type is good enough for INFO type is =
not a consensus either.

If there are too many misuses (or abuses) of INFO then we need to =
realize if it's due to lack of INFO understanding or lack of defined =
functionality. We should map these cases. So far I have not seen many =
claims that INFO is required for something specific, either because most =
implementers do not use it or because it is deemed so unworthy in these =
discussions that people are shy.

My personal feeling is that INFO is too broken to be fixed at this =
point. If implementers used INFO to solve issues, in a way that seems as =
if INFO should not be used in a normative RFC, then we should think of =
alternative solutions. However, I might change my mind if I see good =
usages of INFO.

OK; returning a 3xx seems to be preferred.  Then, so that we can
update the next revision appropriately, here is some rough text:

   A proxy that accesses a location service to route a CONNECT
   request and discovers more than one contact bound to that
   AoR MUST format a 3xx-class response with the contacts discovered
   from the location service.  This response is subsequently
   sent upstream.

   A proxy that receives a 3xx-class response as a result of
   proxying a CONNECT request downstream MUST NOT recurse on the
   receipt of the 3xx-class response.  Instead, it MUST send the
   response upstream.

   When a user agent receives a 3xx-class response from its
   downstream server with multiple Contact headers, it MAY decide
   to fork in parallel or in serial depending on its software
   capabilities and configuration policies.  Alternatively, it
   MAY analyze the received Contact headers and choose to send it
   to a particular destination that it suspects would stand the
   best chance of eliciting a successful response.

OK?

I'm not sure what is the point of this INFO discussion.

We won't stop people for using INFO for what they have been using it for
quite a few years now, and I don't think it would be a proper use of our =
time to
attempt to do so. Especially after we defined RFCs explaining that INFO =
was=20
useful for PSTN tunnelling.

However, what we can do is ensure that we do not define any new RFCs =
that use it.
That's easy enough to do.

We could also attempt to discourage other Standards Bodies or Forum from =
using
INFO as the kitchen sink (e.g., ECMA TR/87). In the absence of any =
guidance from us,
the natural thing for these organizations to do is to use INFO because =
it's so
simple.=20

So, I'd suggest a Standards Track RFC that updates 2976 and makes it =
explicit
that INFO is strictly for PSTN tunnelling (refer to=20

I think for this purpose, something that caps the use of INFO (from a=20
standards perspective) to the usages documented in IETF so far (i.e., =
PSTN protocol
tunneling as per RFC 3204). We should also describe the main issues with =
it (i.e.,
no negotiation, and overloading of signalling channel), and points to =
alternatives:
1 - SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY
2 - A separate protocol (possibly bootstrapped through SIP, =E0 la =
Content indirection
3 - MSRP
4 - etc.

Vijay,

This deals with straightforward forking scenarios. What about a proxy
that is scripted to fork in parallel to two destinations, and then, if
they both fail to answer, fork to a third destination? Or a proxy that
is scripted to forward to one destination, and then, if it fails to
answer after a certain time, fork to a second location without
cancelling the request at the first destination?

Hi,

A small comment.

I don't think we in the draft should say that the UA forks. Because, I =
don't think the UA behavior is different from when it receives a 3xx =
response for e.g. an initial INVITE, is it? It uses the contact in the =
response to initiates new initial request. We don't call that forking, =
do we?

Regards,

Christer

I call it UA forking (as opposed to proxy forking).

I'm ok with calling it something else.=20

I have a funny feeling that if we had made the distinction=20
clearer way back when we were discussing the merits of forking,
we would have had a different outcome.

Presumably, if the proxy understands the "Proxy-Require: sipsec"
option tag, it will follow the normative behavior of returning
the destinations in a 3xx instead of launching into the fork dance.
If it is a legacy proxy, it should reject the CONNECT request
on encountering a "Proxy-Require: sipsec" option tag.

Thanks.

Hi,=20

>I call it UA forking (as opposed to proxy forking).

I don't think 3261 calls it UA forking.

When triggering requests based on a 3xx response, I think 3261 talks =
about "recursion".

Christer

The value (from an end-user perspective) is "Simultaneous or Parallel =
Ringing".

At the technical level it is implementable either using proxy forking, =

whatever you call it, there is still a difference between trying things 
serially and trying them in parallel. If the UA gets a 3xx with one 
contact and recurses on it then you have serial forking. If the UA gets 
a 3xx with multiple contacts and tries them one by one you still have 
serial forking. If the UA gets a 3xx with multiple contacts and tries 
them all at once then you have parallel forking.

Some of these cases can be handled by attaching q-values to the contacts 
in the 3xx, if the UA cooperates by doing the ones with equal q-value in 
parallel and the ones with different q-values in descending q-value order.

But it doesn't deal with more complex policy. And of course if this is 
done by the callee's home proxy then it can be certain the policy is 
followed. If it is deferred to the caller then you can't be sure.

Of course this is to some extent a battle over who's policy should be 
followed, and there is no single right answer here. But its probably 
safe to assume that many callee's won't want to give up control over this.

An alternative I suggested earlier, that nobody commented on, is to 
start out with a regular INVITE, which can potentially fork. After a 
dialog is established, do a CONNECT/Replaces to establish a secure 
session to the target. This could be done during an early dialog, or 
after the final dialog is established. This could be triggered by 
presence of "Supported:sipsec" in the response.

Yeah, we tought about that.

The problem is that the INVITE is loaded with too much information that
would then
leak.

The idea of the CONNECT is that it would have the bare minimum to route.
Then the full
blown end-to-end secure INVITE (with the SDP) could be exchanged.=20

There is a big difference between, "I can support this format", and "I 
am interested in having you send me events in this format". This is why 
we didn't go with the INFO method for DTMF. Since DTMF would already be 
arriving at the UAS in the form of 2833, the primary entities needing 
signaling-based solutions are applications not on the media path. But, 
we only want to send such signaling when there is an application that is 
interested. This is exactly what SUB/NOT is for - to ask for 
notifications of events.

Furthermore, by using a separate dialog we could have the notifications 
sent just to the interested application server, so that the proxies on 
the path of the original dialog don't need to see INFO messages flying 
by if they weren't interested.

Consider further the other UA in the call. If it supports both 
DTMF-over-INFO and RFC2833, what does it mean to get both? If you 
generate DTMF on receipt of INFO, you stand a real risk of generating 
double DTMF which is very bad. You avoid this problem if you only send 
DTMF over signaling when asked; this way the thing getting the rfc2833 
doesn't ask for it.

Using SUB/NOT also allowed the application to customize when it would 
get a notification. So for example an app that needed each digit as it 
was pressed could get them immediately. One only needing them after some 
  pattern was matched could only get it then. This was also a perfect 
match for SUB/NOT.

So there are serious technical limitations to carrying DTMF over INFO. 
Sure, it can 'work', but it is very suboptimal and can cause problems.

As for a general INFO usage, my opinion is unchanged on this. We have 
numerous methods for extending SIP by adding new headers and methods and 
event packages. Can you demonstrate a use case where one of these 
extensibility mechanisms is not sufficient for some use case?

This is part of why I think we need sips - we have countless drafts 
which reference it as the security mechanism to use when you want to 
protect against modification of signaling messages by off-path attackers.

Thus, I think this draft should continue the current policy and 
reference sips.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Both fixed.

These two sections are based on different registries - one is for SIP 
option tags and the other for media feature tags. So the names are 
different.

No. The media feature tag is used there instead. Section 4 calls this 
out, as it mentions that the media feature tag is used on REGISTER 
requests and OPTIONS responses.


If so, that would be worth mentioning explicitly as an
> exception to the "SHOULD NOT"

Actually I'll mention it as part of that restriction rather than an 
inclusion.

I'm trying to avoid having more than one way of signaling something.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

                                                                                           
        Title           : Indicating Support for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
        Author(s)       : J. Rosenberg
        Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-ice-option-tag-02.txt
        Pages           : 8
        Date            : 2007-06-19
                                                                                           
This specification defines a media feature tag and an option tag for
use with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The media feature
tag allows a UA to communicate to its registrar that it supports ICE.
The option tag allows a User Agent (UA) to require support for ICE in
order for a call to proceed.
                                                                                           
A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ice-option-tag-02.txt

Send a message to:

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
        MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
        feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
        command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
        a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
        exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
        "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
        up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
        how to manipulate these messages.
                                                                                           
                                                                                           
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

With all due respect, seriously.

This part of why you think we need sips argument reduces to: its been
there for a long time and it hasn't been fixed it so it provides real
end-to-end security, and since there's nothing else, other draft writers
have been forced to reference it so lets just maintain the status quo.  

Again, with all due respect, I don't think this is a reasonable
argument.  The fundamental problem with sips is that its not end-to-end.
If it were end-to-end, there would be no discussion it would just be
getting implemented and used.  How long will it be before those "in
control" of the standards realize that there is a pressing need, indeed
a requirement, among the users of the standard for true end-to-end
security and put something that "they" think is OK in place to address
it?

Faithfully submitted,
Dougla... *cough*

Yes; it is desirable and useful to provide an authentication mechanism 
that uses certificates to authenticate a registrar to its UA and a SIP
UA to its registrar, rather than the existing Digest mechanism that
uses a shared secret between the UA and its registrar.

I expect you're referring to HTTP, as HTTP is where SIP derived its
Digest authentication from.  

I don't believe HTTP has any need or interest in using certificates
for client authentication; however, as you know, there is some interest
in considering how HTTP's authentication can be 'fixed' (modernized).

draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-03 seems suitable in capturing
requirements.

During the discussion of the HTTPbis BoF, 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg
there were some people that suggested RFC2617 (which defines HTTP's
Basic and Digest authentication) also be revised.  This may have some
bearing on SIP, if it is decided that HTTPbis's charter will include
a revision of RFC2617.

Ah, sipsec?

Of course, if you think Vijay, Francois and I are "in control" of  
standards, I have to tell you it's the other way around.

I think the sipsec draft is quite reasonable.

It wasn't completely clear to me from Figures 2 and 3 whether the
session signaling, i.e. post-CONNECT, was traversing the proxies or not?
I would prefer to see the CONNECT transaction somehow enable the UAC and
UAS to signal directly between each other without proxies from then on.
Is that what is intended or is the subsequent signaling still passing
through the intermediate proxies?

Thanks,
FM

But maybe the INVITE could contain minimal information, e.g., an SDP
offer with no media. Note that METHOD/Replaces cannot be sent to a UAS
during an early dialog, so CONNECT/Replaces would have to be sent in the
backwards direction.

Also we would need to consider what happens if the regular INVITE
arrives at a proxy or UAS that does not support sipsec. May need to use
Require/Proxy-Require, or maybe we could achieve some sort of best
effort security by not requiring sipsec support.

HI,

> -	whether this represents a problem space that the working group
> should draft requirements on?
certificate based authentication from my point of view is useful to
increase the security of the=20
user authentication, which is currently achieved by HTTP digest.

> -	whether the problem space exists but is something slightly
> different, and if so what is that problem space?

as SIP borrows the digest authentication from HTTP, it might also be
possible to enhance the HTTP authentication and re-use it in SIP for the
certificate based authentication. As Dan already wrote a potential
HTTPbis might capture this approach.

this draft outlines the requirements for certificate based
authentication for SIP and should therefore be used as a requirements
document. I guess it does not necessarily determine, if the solution is
being defined in SIP as opposed to define the base solution for HTTP and
derive a solution in SIP

Of course that is not what I am saying.

What I am saying is that one of our key security needs is a technique 
that allows us to protect signaling from off-path attackers. That 
includes prevention against eavesdropping and protection against 
modification of signaling messages. SIPS meets that need.

In any case I don't want to turn yet another thread into a sips bashing 
one. THis thread is about ice-option-tag.

So unless you are suggesting changes to sip-ice-option-tag, I'd like to 
move forward with that document.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Frank: In certain cases -- peers behind NAT, for instance -- you will
have to keep the proxies in the path.

Changing the subject name...

Agreed, but really only for cases where ICE would result in use of a
relay correct?  In all other cases, the CONNECT path would establish the
"way in" to the UAS through the NAT for the subsequent INVITE to come in
directly would it not?

Relay is only required for a percentage of connections.  It's also my
hope that with the BEHAVE work, NAT vendors will over time make their
NATs more friendly to SIP-like services.  Ultimately, what I'm hoping is
that the use of relays becomes less necessary rather than more
necessary.  While I'm sure that despite IPv6, NATS will be around
forever, I do believe in the basic design tenet that underlies the
Internet architecture, the principle of e2e.  That principle in this
instance I believe should nudge us into trying to design for direct UAC
to UAS signaling when possible. 

I'm all for this tunneling mechanism, it may be a happy medium, but my
architectural sense is that once the two endpoints have found each
other, the best way to really insure e2e security is to have them signal
each other directly.

Thanks,
FM

The advantage of the CONNECT method is that we don't have to change
the behavior associated with INVITE. And we don't have to change
what is the mandatory content of INVITE either. (It's not just the
SDP).

For example, with CONNECT we want to mandate "no proxy forking".

Frank,

If you have a solution in mind, please let us know.

You are just as much "in control" of standards as anybody else
in this group.

SIPS is indeed not end-to-end. Yes, we know that. SIP in general
is also not end-to-end.

End-to-end comes at a cost, as we've seen with S/MIME, MIKEY and

appropriate to use than others.

This version should address all the WGLC comments on this draft, and
that should mean we are done with this draft.

The related draft-ietf-mmusic-ice is currently undergoing a further
WGLC, so we will wait until that is ready before submitting to IESG.

That gives you a window to check that your comments and concerns already
expressed have been addressed. Please check sooner rather than later. I
would also suggest that we are at the stage where if you want text
changed, it is more than appropriate to state exactly what you believe
the new text should be, in order to prevent too many rounds of
clarification on what is intended by the comment.

Regards

Keith

Generally speaking, yes.

An individual event package may restrict that behavior though.

When you indicate the stuff you support in an OPTIONS response, I agree
it's "I can support this format".

But, if I in an INVITE response indicate support of a certain content
type I think that can also be seen as "When/if you are going to send me
X, please use this format".

>path.

In most cases, yes, and my intention is not to promote people to use a
signaling-based solution instead of 2833. We could even make very strong
recommendations to always use 2833, when possible.

(However, in theory you could also have a signalling gateway, without
access to media, which sends the DTMFs using a signaling-based solution
since the protocol "on the other side" also does it.)

The application may not necessarily know that I am going to send him
anything, and then it will have to ask "just in case".

That is an advantage, yes.

...eventhough I wonder how many proxies you actually would be able to
"skip" in real life scenarios. You may have routes established using
Path and/or Service-Route, for example.

You have exactly the same problem with SUB/NOT, if you BOTH subscribbe
to the DTMF event AND inciate support of 2833 in your SDP.

So, the solution is: you indicate EITHER support of 2833 OR the
signaling-based mechanism (whatever it is).=20

this way the thing getting the rfc2833 doesn't=20
>ask for it.

I am not sure I understand that. Even if I use SUB/NOT I don't know
exactly when the DTMF event will come (if it will come), and I could
still also receive 2833 while the subscription is active.

>Using SUB/NOT also allowed the application to customize when it would

match for SUB/NOT.

Well, obviously people using INFO do not need the subscriber to be able
to "push" the digitmap. But, if I am asked to give 4 digits I may
implement a user interface which allows me to enter the digits before
they are sent in a single INFO (assuming the INFO based mechanism allows
it).

And, I am not saying that all INFO usages are good, and that you
couldn't use a better (both from a functionality and complexity
perspective) alternative.

        RFC 4916



        Title:      Connected Identity in the Session 

                    Initiation Protocol (SIP) 

        Author:     J. Elwell

        Status:     Standards Track

        Date:       June 2007

        Mailbox:    john.elwell@siemens.com

        Pages:      24

        Characters: 42924

        Updates:    RFC3261

        See-Also:   



        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-05.txt



        URL:        http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4916.txt



This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol

(SIP) User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to

supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the

reverse direction, and for that identity to be signed by an

Authentication Service.  Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming

request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives

it (the User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from

that in the To header field.  The same mechanism can be used to

indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some

action in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a

gateway.  This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).  

[STANDARDS TRACK]

Draft:  draft-ietf-sip-saml-02
Reviewer: Richard Barnes
Review Date: 18 Jun 07


Security / Privacy Concerns:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. It's never made clear what entity is the Subject of the conveyed 
assertions.  This could be a critical distinction, e.g., if one party 
assumes that it's the UAC being discussed, and the other the user of the 
UAC.

2. Section 9 needs a discussion the nature of the assurances provided by 
SAML assertions.  In general, in order for it to be verifiable that the 
SAML assertion was issued by the Authentication Service, there must be 
proof that the holder of the private key used to create the 
Identity-Info header.  There are several ways to do this:
2.a. The SAML assertion is signed with the appropriate private key
2.b. An unsigned SAML assertion is provided over HTTPS by a server that 
authenticates with the same certificate
2.c. The Identity-Info is integrity-protected from the point where it is 
added by the Authentication Service until it reaches the UAS.

3. The list of threats and countermeasures in Section 9 is incomplete. 
For instance:
3.a. There's no discussion of threats of attacks by elements of the SIP 
signaling path (e.g., manipulating the URI in the Identity-Info header)
3.b. The anti-replay mechanism should reference the expiry elements 
built into the assertion (e.g., the NotOnOrAfter attribute)

4. The document isn't clear on whether or not the assertions MUST be 
signed by the issuer.  Section 6.1.5, step 3 seems to imply that the 
assertion will be signed, but Section 9.3 seems to assume that this 
isn't necessarily the case.  IMHO, it should be that the assertion MUST 
be signed by the same key used to generate the identity digest.  But 
even if this isn't the case, this point should be clarified.

5. No mention is made of the possible sensitivity of the contents of 
SAML assertions.  It's possible that these assertions could contain 
sensitive information about the Subject, such as statements about what 
identities the subject holds.  There should be some discussion about 
what measures should be taken in this case, e.g., the use of HTTPS and 
authentication of dereferencing clients.

General Comments:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Conveying SAML assertions via a URI in the Identity-Info header 
contradicts Section 9 of RFC 4474, which says that the resource 
indicated MUST be of type "application/pkix-cert".  ISTM there are at 
least a couple of ways to fix this:
1.a. Normatively update RFC 4474 to allow the resource to be of either type
1.b. Normatively update RFC 4474 to allow for a "multipart/mixed" with 
one part of each type
1.c. Add a separate header to carry the SAML assertion
In the interest of backward-compatibility, I don't think you can get rid 
of application/pkix-cert altogether.

2. The subdivisions under sections 6 and 7 seem unnecessary.  Section 
6.1.X should be Section 6.X (or maybe 6.(X+1)), and likewise for section 7.


Localized Comments and Nits:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2:
I would switch the order of the definitiosn of "profile attribute(s)" 
and "user profile, subject profile".

Section 3, paragraph starting "Thus one can employ...":
Change "to make and encode statements" to "to encode statements".

Section 6.1.2, paragraph starting "Although this...":
Change "this profile is overview is" to "this profile overview is"

Figure 2:
In the INVITE messages, the AoR in the From: header should be 
"sip:alice@foo.com"

Section 6.1.2, Step 3:
The AS is supposed to insert "attributes required by Bob's domain".  How 
is it supposed to know which attributes these are?  This is answered by 
the following paragraph, which should be moved up to here.

Section 6.1.2, Step 3:
The AS constructs a "HTTP-based SAML URI reference" -- shouldn't this be 
a reference according to the binding defined in this document, instead 
of the original (SAMLv2) reference standard?

Section 6.1.2, Step 5, second paragraph:
"the AS continues" should be "the UAS continues"

Section 6.1.3.3, third paragraph:
This paragraph gives the option of HTTPS or HTTP, but doesn't specify 
that one of the two MUST be used.  Suggested text: "The AS MUST 
construct either an HTTP or HTTPS URI per Section "3.7.5.1 URI Syntax" 
of [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os].  It is RECOMMENDED that the AS 
construct an HTTPS URI."

Section 6.1.3.3, fourth paragraph:
This is not technically correct; the URI should be the absoluteURI 
portion of the Identity-Info header value.

Section 6.1.4:
Through out this section, situations with exceptions are presented as 
"SHOULD ... MAY ...".  As I read it, this creates a situation without a 
mandatory default behavior; I would prefer if these were worded as 
MUSTs, with MAYs allowed under specified circumstances.

Section 6.1.4.1.3:
The SHOULDs in this section should be should be MUSTs.

Section 6.1.4.1.4, second paragraph:
This needs to say that the attribute-value pairs MUST pertain to the 
subject of the assertion (a concept which needs to be tied to a SIP 
entity elsewhere in the document).  This may be the entity identified in 
the From header, or another identified entity.

Section 6.1.5, Step 3:
Section 5.4 of the indicated reference doesn't say anything about how 
signatures are verified.  Instead, this should reference Section 3.2 of 
the XMLdsig document referenced.  Also is this TODO resolved?

Section 6.1.5, Step 5:
Specify how this verification is done, e.g., by verifying that the 
signed-identity-digest and the signature on the SAML assertion are both 
verifiable with the key in the cert in the assertion.

Section 6.1.5, Step 7:
The relevant field in the X.509 certificate are Subject and Subject 
Alternative Name (not Issuer and Issuer Alternative Name).  The Issuer 
of the assertion is the Subject of the certificate.

Section 7:
This binding doesn't really have anything to do with SIP.  Could we just 
exclude SIP from the name?  Maybe this could be the IETF standard URI 
binding of SAML.

Hello, 

In section 4.3, there is the following text:
"(e.g., a Refer-To header field with a Content-ID URL pointing to a body part whose disposition type is 'session'), the UAS SHOULD return a 415 (Unsupported Media   Type) response."

Can I include a Content-ID URL like this?
    Refer-To: <sip:a@example.com?body="CID:12345@example.com">
And the Content-ID URL point to a body part, whose disposition type is not ' recipient-list', might be 'session'. 

Maybe this draft could write something about the special hname "body", since the purpose of the draft is to clarify how message bodies are handled in SIP.

Cheers,
Qian

The construction seems to be nonsense. When the REFER containing this is 
acted upon it would result in an INVITE with a body containing the CID URI.

I assume you want the resulting INVITE to have the referenced body part 
as its body. That sounds possibly useful, but I don't see any way to 
disambiguate the cases.

The use of "body" as a SIP URI parameter is interesting for completeness 
with header parameters, but I have never seen a use of it. The use of 
header parameters in general is pretty limited.

> Maybe this draft could write something about the special hname "body", since the purpose of the draft is to clarify how message bodies are handled in SIP.

It seems off-topic to what the draft is otherwise tackling.

Hi, here are some comments to the draft: =
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt

=20

a) Comments

[Page 2], Abstract

Can you add a reference to the corresponding RFC number? (RFC4474, =
RFC4484?)

=20

[Page 3], Introduction

Is this document only about assertion for the authorization or also for =
the authentication?

=20

[Page 7], 3.1. SAML Assertion

...including issuer, timestamp (IssueInstant) and subject ...

=20

[Page 9], 4. Specification scope

...SIP profile and binding ...

=20

[Page 12]

Domain name for Alice: example.com or foo.com?? (same comment for other =
figures)

Authentication service or Assertion service or both?

=20

[Page 13], 6.1. Assertion Fetch profile

Is this the only planned profile or will other profiles be defined and =
added later?  Will there also be a push based model? Will it then be =
"pushed" as part of the SIP message?=20

=20

[Page 13], 6.1.1. URN

What's the current consensus for the urn?

=20

[Page 17], 6.1.3.

...sender and Authentication service (AS) may be separate or... ???

How will the AS and sender be combined? Should it not be Authentication =
or Assertion service which can be combined?

=20

[Page 22], 6.1.4.1.4.

AttributeStatement is indicated. But what about Authentication and =
Authorization Decision statement?=20

=20

[Page 23], Step 3, TODO

I think it's always good to indicate problems with the assertion.

=20

[Page36], Figure 5

should de saml: keyword not be added for the XML elements?

saml:Assertion,=20

=20

[Page30] Security considerations

Is it possible to redirect messages to an own authentication service by =
manipulating the end-device? How can the called party trust the =
authentication service assigned by the caller?

=20

[Page31]

This RFC draft talks about assertions. But how can an identity be =
asserted only by considering a device, e.g. in case a device is stolen =
or temporary used by someone else? At VON 2000, H. Schulzrinne has =
already indicated that something as fingerprint has to be added for a =
device with a changing set of owners.=20

=20

=20

b) Typos

[Page 11], 5, =A71: ...because the those -> because those:=20

[Page 14], 5.1.2: ...Although this profile is overview ....->=20

[Page 21], 5.1.4.1: ....requirments .... ->=20

[Page 40], Appendix A: ...addtional. ->=20

=20

br,

Marc.

I must confess that on an initial reading of the draft, I was
lost on the need for requirements that add certificate
authentication to SIP.  Using TLS, a registrar and a UAC and
exchange certificates today and authenticate each other,
without resorting to a shared secret, right?

I beleive the use case that the author is going for has to do with
using the hop-by-hop signaling path through a SIP proxy mesh to a
registrar, but being able to exchange certificates directly
between the UAC and the registrar.  As such, the title of the
draft ought to be reflective of this; something along the lines
of "Requirements for direct registrar authentication in the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) by a User Agent Client (UAC)".

> -	whether the problem space exists but is something slightly

If the problem space is defined as coming up with requirements
for direct registrar authentication in SIP by a UAC over a
normal SIP proxy mesh, then that is a reasonable problem space,
IMHO.

I beleive that this is fairly specific to SIP, but will defer
to the chairs and the rest of the WG.

This draft also talks about interpreting the contents of the
certificates (S3, requirement 8).  As such, some of the work Scott
Lawrence and I have done in domain-certs provides more
guidelines on this particular aspect.  We received good feedback
from the pkix WG in Prague when we presented domain-certs
there; we are in the process of revising the domain-certs draft
to include a discrete set of steps that can be programmed to
do certificate validation.  We should be sending a revised
version of this draft out by tomorrow.

domain-certs, as mentioned above.  In addition, sip-sipsec could
provide a possible solution set; it appears to fit some of the
requirements.

Thanks.

Hi Sergio,

Changing response routing is out of scope of the outbound spec.

Hi Jeroen,

I don't think there is any problem here.  If the UAC wants to put  
different Contact URIs with different reg-ids for the same instance- 
id, that is the business of the UAC.  For a specific instance the  
authoritative proxy will pick one of the reg-ids and forward there.   
If the proxy gets a 430 response it will try the next one.  The proxy  
will need to set the Request URI to the Contact URI of the desired  
reg-id for each attempt.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Erkki,

At IETF68 we agreed to add an indicator "timed-keepalive" that the
*server* expects keepalives to happen according to the timers
recommended in the draft.  If the server asks for this, then the
client needs to send pings (STUN over UDP or double CRLF over TCP or
TLS).  The *client* can tell if the server will send pongs (STUN
binding responses over UDP, or single CRLF over TCP or TLS) if the
server advertises "keep-stun" or "keep-crlf".  This allows a battery
operated client to use TCP keepalives or send pings less often if the
server allows, and it allows the client in general to know if they
should expect to receive pongs.

thanks,
-rohan

This can be a problem even when using TCP if there are proxies in the
path. There is no requirement for proxies to deliver messages in the
order they receive them.

With TLS, the UAC can authenticate its proxy, yes.  But the
establishment of a TLS session, even mutually-authenticated
TLS (which is not mandated by RFC3261, by the way) doesn't 
inheriently provide authentication of the REGISTER message.
I suppose it _could_, but we don't have that written down
anywhere that I'm aware of.

Hello, 
Thanks, Paul. So if a UA wants a SIP request triggered by the REFER to include a specified body, we can not use the hname "body". Can we define a new disposition type to explicitly indicate the triggered SIP request by REFER should carry the corresponding content body?

For example:
REFER sip:uac1@example.com SIP/2.0
Refer-To: <sip:uac2@example.com; method=MESSAGE>
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Disposition: referred-body
Hello World!

Then the MESSAGE triggered by the REFER will include the content which disposition type is "referred-body", i.e., "Hello World!"

Cheers,
Qian

The construction seems to be nonsense. When the REFER containing this is 
acted upon it would result in an INVITE with a body containing the CID URI.

I assume you want the resulting INVITE to have the referenced body part 
as its body. That sounds possibly useful, but I don't see any way to 
disambiguate the cases.

The use of "body" as a SIP URI parameter is interesting for completeness 
with header parameters, but I have never seen a use of it. The use of 
header parameters in general is pretty limited.

> Maybe this draft could write something about the special hname "body", since the purpose of the draft is to clarify how message bodies are handled in SIP.

It seems off-topic to what the draft is otherwise tackling.

Sorry - I don't understand your question.

But in general there are potential issues of this sort in sending one
request on a dialog before a prior request has completed. It is best to
be avoided, though in certain cases it may be ok.

You can use "body" - but then the *value* of the body to be included is 
taken from the value of the "body" parameter.

I just searched through my collection of sip drafts and RFCs (several 
years worth) for uses of this, and I only found three:

draft-mahy-sip-peer-3pcc-00 (2002 - expired)
draft-johnston-sipping-cc-uui-01 (2007 - active)
draft-ietf-sipping-transc-conf-03 (2006 - in RFC Ed Queue)

Of these, draft-ietf-sipping-transc-conf-03 doesn't show an actual 
encoded body - it just proposes use without showing it. But at least it 
appears a plausible use.

The usage shown in the other two is, IMO, questionable.

I think it remains to be seen if this construct will actually be 
supported. The use of header parameters of this sort, by the receiving 
UA is discretionary. It must be, because there are security risks to 
doing whatever someone asks you to do. So I don't think you can in 
general be confident that your request will be honored if you use this 
mechanism.

I suppose you could propose such a change. I don't know if it would be 
accepted.

What are you trying to achieve by all of this?

Hi. I have bumped into Question #19 from
http://www.sipknowledge.com/SIP_Dev_Expert_Exam_Linked_from_most_wanted_
42.htm.
They ask there about possible cases when SIP client may get
authenticated by a server.=20
=20
This makes me wonder: There does not seem to be a current way to
authenticate a called party by a proxy right? (as the proxy-authenticate
header may be used only in 4xx responses but not in INVITE), so we need
to trust the registrar that it fulfilled its authentication job. But
what if we like to keep registration interval very large (e.g. for sake
of saving battery's life, keeping network quiet)? How can one make sure
the security of the phone was not compromised at the meantime?

Folks: draft-gurbani-sip-domain-certs-05 has been submitted to
the IETF archives.  This version includes the guidance we
got from the pkix WG in Prague.  More specifically, this version
focuses strictly on:

- How to use and interpret the SIP identities in a X.509 certificate.
- How to indicate that this particular certificate is for SIP
  usage.

Based on feedback from -04, we have removed pinning references
and connection reuse references.  In addition, what goes in
the subjectAltName and the detailed steps to interpret and
validate it are provided from the viewpoint of user agents,
proxies, and registrars.

Until the -05 version appears in the archives, you can get it
from:

https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/gurbani/domain-certs/draft-gurbani-sip-domain-certs-05.txt
https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/gurbani/domain-certs/draft-gurbani-sip-domain-certs-05.html

Comments, questions and other feedback is much appreciated.

Thanks,

- vijay

One other forking scenario, that I am not sure will be handled by usage
of 3xx:

I have set up the forking so that if the call comes to ravi@work.com or
ravi@home.com, call gets forked to both.=20

It would get handled in normal forking, but when the proxy returns 3xx,
for the next CONNECT also it again keeps sending 3xx responses.

How would this scenario be handled?

Regards,
Ravi.

Hi Vijay, Dean, Francois,

=20

would it be needed to specify what messaging can occur inside the
established tunnel? I understand that the proxies do not need to know
what goes on inside, but for the two end UAs to interwork, would that
need to be clearly specified?=20
For example,=20

Can more than one Dialog go on inside the established tunnel?=20

Can messages of multiple Dialogs established across different tunnels be
sent in other tunnels than in the one they were originally established
in? (this affect the way in which SUB+NOT mechanism would work, OR the
way lost TLS connections to be re-established in a new tunnel without
dropping a Dialog.. etc)

Ravi.

Hello, Paul
Your information is very useful. We are trying to achieve some application service features by using REFER method, the referred SIP request is needed to carry a specified message-body. But the hname "body" can only include very limited information, so we consider content-id mechanism. Now it seems a new disposition type may be better. To the security risk, I think this is an inherent question of REFER, RFC 3515 and REFERRED-BY have talked a lot about this.

I greatly appreciate your help!

Cheers,
Qian

You can use "body" - but then the *value* of the body to be included is 
taken from the value of the "body" parameter.

I just searched through my collection of sip drafts and RFCs (several 
years worth) for uses of this, and I only found three:

draft-mahy-sip-peer-3pcc-00 (2002 - expired)
draft-johnston-sipping-cc-uui-01 (2007 - active)
draft-ietf-sipping-transc-conf-03 (2006 - in RFC Ed Queue)

Of these, draft-ietf-sipping-transc-conf-03 doesn't show an actual 
encoded body - it just proposes use without showing it. But at least it 
appears a plausible use.

The usage shown in the other two is, IMO, questionable.

I think it remains to be seen if this construct will actually be 
supported. The use of header parameters of this sort, by the receiving 
UA is discretionary. It must be, because there are security risks to 
doing whatever someone asks you to do. So I don't think you can in 
general be confident that your request will be honored if you use this 
mechanism.

I suppose you could propose such a change. I don't know if it would be 
accepted.

What are you trying to achieve by all of this?

Sorry, I had missed this going by until someone pointed it out ... 

Basically, I would support this work in SIP WG, which does seem like the 
right place at least for requirements (can see where it goes next from 
there).

SIP WG seems like as good a place as any, at least for requirements.

Yes, the problem space exists.

Develop the *requirements* first, then ask this question.  A worthy 
question for this list would be whether the requirements should expand to 
use cases beyond Registrar interactions (e.g to Invite, Subscribe/Notify, 
or to streaming uses, etc).  Of course, the Security Area should be 
involved regardless, esp at solution time.

I believe it is close, modulo wondering about expansion beyond Register as 
above.  (Could dicker over details...)

Subject: [Sip] Certificate authentication in SIP

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-03
.txt 

Describes a set of requirements for:

   This document defines requirements for adding certificate
   authentication to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This
   document is being presented with the intention of providing clear
   requirements to any potential solutions specifying certificate
   authentication within SIP networks.  Supporting certificate
   authentication in SIP would provide strong authentication and
   increase the types of possible deployment scenarios.

(Before we go any further, please forget all about the solutions
document - that comes later and we are not dealing with it now)

We need to decide whether there is support for a body of work in this
area, and therefore whether we should charter some requirements work in
the SIP WG.

(Because this is security related we have agreed that SIP does the
requirements drafting and not SIPPING)

So can I hear opinions of the WG on:

-                whether this represents a problem space that the working 
group
should draft requirements on?

-                whether the problem space exists but is something 
slightly
different, and if so what is that problem space?

-                whether there is a more general problem that the security 
area
should be addressing, rather than the SIP group addressing something
specific?

-                based on your answers to the first three questions, 
whether this
draft is essentially in the right direction to be adopted as the WG
draft assuming we create the charter item, or whether we need to seek
some other input draft?

work) there
is any work in any other IETF WG that we should take account of?

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

                                                                                           
        Title           : Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
        Author(s)       : J. Rosenberg
        Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-gruu-14.txt
        Pages           : 41
        Date            : 2007-06-25
                                                                                           
Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used
by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA
instance.  A URI that routes to a specific UA instance is called a
Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  This document describes an
extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a registrar and for
communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog.
                                                                                           
A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
        MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
        feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
        command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
        a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
        exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
        "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
        up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
        how to manipulate these messages.
                                                                                           
                                                                                           
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

draft-ietf-sip-
gruu-11 on 13th November 2006 with comments requested by 27th November
2006.

Review was made and comments were received during the last call
identified=20
above from: Andrew Allen, Jeroen van Bemmel, Vijay Gurbani, Paul
Kyzivat,=20
Xavier Marjo, Eric Rescorla, Robert Sparks, Dale Worley, (with an
indication=20
that all had performed a full review of the draft. During the course of
the=20
work comments have also been made by at least the following: Jesus

See also the acknowledgements list in the document. See=20
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/reviews/gruu/index.html for documentation
of=20
the final extensive review.

There have been key issues in the discussion that have been resolved to
the=20
satisfaction of the SIP working group, but which are worth mentioning
here:

*	A grid parameter existed as part of the earlier drafts up to
draft-
ietf-sip-gruu-10. The GRID parameter was removed from GRUU in response=20
to comments received. Instead, loose routing is proposed to provide=20
the ability of 'end-instance switching'. The gr URI parameter=20
(formerly gruu URI parameter) now takes a value, replacing opaque as=20
the server-side 'switch'.=20
*	Up to and including draft-ietf-sip-gruu-10, GRUU did not provide
any=20
anonymity functions at all. Indeed, the recommendations for=20
construction of gruus were such that they would contain the users AOR.=20
The point was raised that there were many places, such as Europe,=20
where anonymous calls are the norm. This is because privacy laws=20
require that caller ID be given out as an opt-in feature, and the=20
default is privacy. Conclusion in -11 was that serial pseudonymity is=20
provided. A user is given lots of anonymous GRUU, allowing it to use a=20
different one for each call. Each remain valid the entire duration of=20
the registration.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

Whilst not specifically a security related document, the document has
been=20
reviewed by Eric Rescorla (the security adviser to the SIP working
group),=20
and there are no remaining unresolved issues.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this document
          been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the
          disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on
          this issue.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the document.

There is one patent disclosure against this document from Microsoft=20
Corporation. They have indicated they are prepared to license any rights
on=20
the basis of "Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory License to All
Implementers=20
with Possible Royalty/Fee". This has been brought to the attention of
the=20
working group and no concerns were expressed.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

The document has been well discussed and extensively reviewed by a=20
significant number of members of the working group (see answer in 1(b)).

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.=20

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.)  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?  If the document
          does not already indicate its intended status at the top of
          the first page, please indicate the intended status here.

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, these have been
performed=20
as a SIP working group item, and therefore this draft is in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427.

The document passes ID-NITS (idnits 2.04.09) with the exception of the=20
following:

  ** There are 4 instances of too long lines in the document, the
longest=20
one being 6 characters in excess of 72.

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative references are appropriate normative=20
references. All the normative references are published except:

*	reference [13] to draft-ietf-sip-outbound which is still in the
final=20
stages of development within the SIP working group.

All the normative references are standards track documents except:

*	reference [4] to RFC 2119 which is a BCP.
*	reference [8] to RFC 3968 which is a BCP.
*	reference [9] to RFC 3969 which is a BCP.

All the informative references are also published except:

*	reference [18] to draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer which is still
in=20
progress in the SIPPING WG.
*	reference [27] to draft-ietf-sipping-gruu-reg-event for which=20
publication has been requested by the SIPPING WG.
*	reference [28] to draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route for which a

charter milestone exists in the SIP WG, and for which this is a=20
candidate.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document's IANA
          Considerations section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggest a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the
          document describes an Expert Review process, has the Document
          Shepherd conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that
          the IESG can appoint the needed Expert during IESG Evaluation?

Section 11.1 of the document registers two new header field parameters.
This=20
registration is consistent with RFC 3968 which defines the registry and
is=20
also consistent with the current format of the registry.

Section 11.2 of the document registers a new SIP URI parameter. This=20
registration is consistent with RFC 3969 which defines the registry and
is=20
also consistent with the current format of the registry.

Section 11.3 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new
option-tag=20
is defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent
with=20
RFC 3261 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the
current=20
format of the registry.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The ABNF within the document passes the checks in Bill Fenner's ABNF
parsing=20
web service.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

Technical Summary

Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a
user=20
agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used by anyone
on=20
the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance.  A URI that=20
routes to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI
(GRUU). =20
This document describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a=20
registrar and for communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog.

Working Group Summary

The document complements work already performed in RFC 4474 for=20
authenticated request identity, and forms an integral part of the
chartered=20
work in this area. There is consensus in the working group to publish
this=20
document.

Document Quality

The document has been well discussed by a significant number of members
of=20
the working group.=20

        RFC 4916



        Title:      Connected Identity in the Session 

                    Initiation Protocol (SIP) 

        Author:     J. Elwell

        Status:     Standards Track

        Date:       June 2007

        Mailbox:    john.elwell@siemens.com

        Pages:      24

        Characters: 42924

        Updates:    RFC3261

        See-Also:   



        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-05.txt



        URL:        http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4916.txt



This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol

(SIP) User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to

supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the

reverse direction, and for that identity to be signed by an

Authentication Service.  Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming

request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives

it (the User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from

that in the To header field.  The same mechanism can be used to

indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some

action in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a

gateway.  This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).

Hi,

I think certificate authentication would be a valuable addition to SIP's
arsenal of authentication methods, to better support environments where
certificates can be deployed, in a similar way as RFCs 3310 and 4169
were done to support SIM-based authentication.

So, I would support adding the topic as a charter item and adopting the
requirements draft as a WG item as the starting point.  =20

Markus

Hello,

Agreed, that this would be a valuable option/alternative to have.

Subject: RE: [Sip] Certificate authentication in SIP

Hi,

I think certificate authentication would be a valuable addition to SIP's
arsenal of authentication methods, to better support environments where
certificates can be deployed, in a similar way as RFCs 3310 and 4169
were done to support SIM-based authentication.

So, I would support adding the topic as a charter item and adopting the
requirements draft as a WG item as the starting point.  =20

Hit send too quickly.

An alternate solution here is to just use TLS between the client and its 
next SIP hop. If thats the registrar, great, we're done. If its an 
intermediate proxy - then the intermediate proxy has basically done the 
authentication and can use RFC 4474 or 3325 to convey that authenticated 
identity to the registrar.

If you are worried about cases of local proxies in untrusted networks, 
separate from your home proxy - well there are tons of problems in that 
model and its something we need to discourage.

If you step back a moment - it seems wrong to me that we are going to 
have our clients implement TLS, which supports client authentication 
with certificates, but then tell them that they need to ALSO implement 
something entirely different to accomplish the same thing.

Hi Paul:
       Is This issue belong to the internal implementation of SIP =

The Partial Notification mechanism  requires PA issue NOTIFY in regular
sequence.

" The PA MUST NOT send a new NOTIFY request that contains a partial
   notification for the same Request-URI until it has received a final
   response from the watcher for the previous one or the previous NOTIFY
   request has timed out. "

I think it is very simple why TLS is not appropriate. TLS doesn't work
across proxies, and would therefore require the edge proxy to do
authentication.
This is why we conventionally use digest or basic auth over TLS.

Certificate authentication would provide the flexibility of TLS + basic
(no challenge/response) with security better than TLS+digest (no replay).

Of course, SIPSEC is another alternative.

I think we're worried about having two authentication domains -- the one
operated by your home proxy (and possibly any "tweeners" like the edge
proxy), and the one operated by a 3rd party from who you acquire
services but that does not necessarily have a business relationship with
and transitive trust of your home proxy. Today, the 3rd party would do
digest auth (or with SIPS, maybe basic), but that has its own set of issues.

RFC3261 section 22.1 states:

Under an authentication scheme that uses responses to carry values
   used to compute nonces (such as Digest), some problems come up for
   any requests that take no response, including ACK.  For this reason,
   any credentials in the INVITE that were accepted by a server MUST be
   accepted by that server for the ACK.  UACs creating an ACK message
   will duplicate all of the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization
   header field values that appeared in the INVITE to which the ACK
   corresponds.  Servers MUST NOT attempt to challenge an ACK.

This means that integrity cannot be verified for the original request URI or 
any body (e.g. in case of offerless INVITE scenario) for ACKs. It also means 
that proxies and UAS need to maintain state in order to authenticate ACKs. 
Even though ACK cannot be challenged, it would still be possible for the UAC 
to calculate a digest as usual, using the same username/password as INVITE 
and the same nonce.

Is this an omission, is there any reason why this is done the way it is?

Regards,
Jeroen

Hi Rohan,

To start with I have to apologize that I have not been able to
attend the latest IETF meetings (and will not be able to make it
for the next meeting either). That said I try to be reasonable
in my posts to the mailing lists even if I am not totally happy
to the fact that these issues were raised already in March but
will not be addressed before the end of June. Last year Outbound
was considered urgent and many WG members wanted it to be finished
as soon as possible, but recently the push to get it out seems to
have vanished somewhere. Maybe there has been something more urgent
gaining the focus.

Responding to the comments you made:

>At IETF68 we agreed to add an indicator "timed-keepalive" that the
>*server* expects keepalives to happen according to the timers
>recommended in the draft.  If the server asks for this, then the
>client needs to send pings (STUN over UDP or double CRLF over TCP or
>TLS). =20

I was able to find a note in the IETF68 SIP meeting minutes for this,
however I am not able to grasp the value of this indicator (unless
it is supposed to carry a value for the timers, but how could the
server know the keepalive times of the NATs between the UA and proxy ?)

>The *client* can tell if the server will send pongs (STUN
>binding responses over UDP, or single CRLF over TCP or TLS) if the
>server advertises "keep-stun" or "keep-crlf".  This allows a battery
>operated client to use TCP keepalives or send pings less often if the
>server allows, and it allows the client in general to know if they
>should expect to receive pongs.

What I am worried about all this is that it seems to make the=20
machinery quite complex. My preference would be to keep things
simple as creeping complexity seems to be a common problem for
SIP and its extensions. (E.g. I have heard many concerns that
the specs from the SIMPLE WG are really far from simple :-)

Yes I was one of the proponents for the UA probing STUN support
of proxy before starting to send STUN requests to the SIP port
of the proxy. However one solution for that, OPTIONS probing for
STUN support, was ultimately deemed too complex in IETF68 and
was agreed to be removed from the draft according to the minutes.

To me it seems that introduction of various flags like
"timed-keepalive",
"keep-stun" and "keep-crlf" will in the end have similar effect to
the complexity, which is not probably justified by the value gained.
I even fail to see how those flags would really help any battery
operated mobile device. The only thing which really helps is the
possibility for the UA to use TCP instead of UDP as TCP has longer
keepalive timers.

After this email from Cullen in the end of March...

http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg18514.html=20

... I was expecting to see a bit different solution in the
next version of the Outbound draft as suggested by me and=20
Christer (to what Cullen agreed):

1. UA would check the transports supported by the proxy via DNS
   (NAPTR and/or SRV)

2. The proxy would indicate its Outbound support e.g. by adding
   'ob' parameter to its URI within the Path header

3. When UA knows the supported transports (from DNS) and Outbound
   support (from Path header) it can be sure that the proxy supports
   all keepalive methods Outbound has specified for those transports.
   At this point the UA can choose its keepalive method amongst:

	a) UDP: UA MUST use STUN
	b) TCP: UA can use either CRLF or TCP keepalives

4. Whatever keepalive method (type of pings) is selected by the UA,
   the proxy will send corresponding responses (pongs):

	a) UDP: STUN responses
	b) TCP: CRLF pongs or TCP ACKs

5. When sending the keepalives the UA would use timers as specified
   in the normative text of SIP Outbound draft.

Defined like that all the other flags "timed-keepalive",
"keep-stun" and "keep-crlf" could be removed from the draft.
I do not see enough value for those flags which seem to=20

a) enable the proxy to support just one keepalive method=20
for TCP; and

b) somehow complex negotiation between UA and proxy whether=20
regular keepalive or heartbeat messages are expected.

Any comments to this proposal ?  If you find it acceptable,
could you please incorporate it either within the next version
of the Outbound draft or raise it as an open question for the
meeting to decide ?


P.S. Earlier I gave a comment like this for CRLF "pongs":

>> How does the addition of CRLF keepalive without CRLF "pong"
>> make the situation worse compared using TCP keepalive, which
>> has been considered acceptable for Outbound over several
>> successive  draft revisions and is still there without any
>> "pong" other than TCP ACK ?

One of my colleagues pointed out that the OS implementations
for TCP keepalive typically have some timer for receiving the
ACKs. Thus it would mean TCP keepalive has an implicit timeout
behaviour which CRLF keepalives lack. After this comment I can
accept the value of CRLF "pong" and do not have any problem with
it.

Thanks,

Erkki

Betreff: Re: SIP SAML Draft Review

Hi Hannes,

I have reviewed the SIP SAML draft version 2. Unfortunately I am not
very familiar with SAML but SIP. But anyway, I hope I can give some
input for this draft. Further more, sorry for being late.

First of all: Editorial comments

Page 4: Add the acronym AS to Authentication Server as for UAS and AUC
Pate 11: Remove double space in the headline of 6.1. and 6.1.3.2.

Other two comments:

- In my point of view, the draft focuses only on trait-based
authorization and tries to deploy trait-based authorization using SAML.
It does not try to specify SAML over SIP, which I was expected.
Therefore, it is more on an SAML artifact resolution protocol using SIP.
The term "artifact resolution protocol" is never mentioned in your =
draft.
And how is the integration of SAML over SIP which carries the assertion
in the SIP message, eg. using MIME multiparts. But I guess, this is now
concerned by the new issue 10 in
http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/issue10.

- Another topic is the usage of the term "Authentication Server" which
has the acronym AS. Since the term is originating from the trait-based
authorization draft, this term should be fine. But from the IMS
perspective, the acronym AS is "Application Server". By today, the SIP
(p)rotocol is more and more associated with IMS and touches the terms of
IMS. Further, the term Authentication Server is not a common term in
SAML. So I propose to use another term, which is more SIP/IMS and/or
SAML conform, e.g. Identity Provider in case of SAML.

BR

Sebastian Felis

What you say is true, but applies specifically to partial notifications.
Since they send deltas from the previous one they won't work if
processed out of order.

Some event packages also need such restrictions. But it isn't a general
restriction.

This document provides clarifications and guidelines concerning the
   use of the SIPS URI scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   It also makes normative changes to SIP.  This document also provides
   a discussion of possible future steps in specification.

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: C. Jennings, R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-outbound-09.txt
	Pages		: 42
	Date		: 2007-6-27
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to
   initiate TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User
   Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, many practical
   considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network
   Address Translators (NATs), prevent servers from connecting to User
   Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User
   Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be
   delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It
   also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open
   and specifies the usage of multiple connections.

I also have to admit I'm a skeptical. Various forms of non-hop-by-hop =
authentication with certificates were enabled by S/MIME, especially in =
conjunction with entities like AIBs. As far as I'm concerned, the =
mechanics have had their day in court, and it didn't go well. We can =
grapple with the syntax to try to find something slightly different that =
will actually appeal to the implementation community, but I don't think =
the problem was that we had the wrong syntax.

So what? I think thats what ought to happen. I'd like to see some 
specific use cases where this can't work with the edge proxy performing 
the authentication. Keep in mind, we are talking about *certificate* 
authentication; that doesn't (by definition) required any kind of 
pre-arranged secret - only a common root CA.

=20
Hi,

I have today had a look into the fresh Outbound-09
to see how it addresses the keepalive issues in comparison
to the proposal I submitted originally in the beginning of
March and resent it yesterday.

My first questions are related to this statement:

   Clients MUST support this CRLF keepalive.

If so, what is the value of promoting the TCP Keepalive within
SIP Outbound ? In which circumstancies an UA supporting TCP=20
Keepalive would instead select sending CRLF keepalive ?


Further on, I like this piece of text within Outbound-09:

   The client needs to perform normal RFC 3263 [4] SIP DNS resolution on
   the URI from the outbound-proxy-set to pick a transport.  Once a
   transport is selected, the UA selects a keepalive approach that is
   allowed for that transport ...=20

That approach is elegant and consistent with RFC 3263.

But I still dislike these pieces of text:

   ... and that is allowed by the server based on the tags in the URI=20
   from the outbound-proxy-set.

   User Agents that form flows check if the configured URI they are
   connecting to has a 'keep-crlf' URI parameter (defined in
   Section 12).  If the parameter is present and the UA is not already
   performing keepalives using another supported mechanism, the UA can
   send keep alives as described in this section.

   User Agents that form flows, check if the configured URI they are
   connecting to has a 'keep-stun' URI parameter (defined in
   Section 12).  If the parameter is present and the UA is not already
   performing keepalives using another supported mechanism, the UA can
   periodically perform keepalive checks by sending STUN [3] Binding
   Requests over the flow as described in Section 8.=20

Outbound-09 suggests that configured proxy URIs could contain
'keep-crlf' or 'keep-stun' parameters, with which the UAs could
check whether the proxy supports the corresponding keepalive
mechanism before starting to send such keepalives. Instead of=20
all that I simply suggest using the 'ob' parameter for the proxy=20
URI to indicate that the proxy supports SIP Outbound and all the=20
keepalive mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound for those transports=20
the proxy supports according to DNS.

Rationale:

1. SIP Outbound anyway already mandates compliant proxies to
   support all keepalive mechanisms (see section 5.4) so there is
   no need to define separate flags for each of those mechanisms.
   One single flag for Outbound support is sufficient indication.

2. The draft has already defined the 'ob' URI parameter and how the
   proxy should use it. My proposal is to use the flag as defined
   but additionally to bundle the semantics of separate keepalive
   flags to this single 'ob' parameter.

3. The UA could check the presence of 'ob' parameter within the
   proxy URI either
	a) within its configured outbound-proxy-set; or
	b) Path header received within 200 OK to REGISTER
	   (like suggested in section 8)

4. Simple is better: less flags to be introduced to IANA,
   to the URIs or to the implementations. Resulting URIs
   would also be shorter with this single and short parameter.


Finally I do not find any value for the 'timed-keepalives'=20
parameter. It was agreed in IETF68 but I was not attending
the meeting and I have not seen the rationale for it anywhere.
For the proxy point of view what is the difference whether or
not the proxy URI contains this parameter ? If the parameter
is within the URI, the proxy can be sure that it receives
the keepalives with intervals defined in the spec but otherwise
the UA could select longer intervals. However the spec does not
specify any actions for the proxy to check how often it receives
the keepalive messages so what is the point to have such a URI
parameter ? Instead of that I would suggest dropping this
parameter and either:

a) mandate the UA always to use timers as defined in the draft
or
b) let the UA always to choose any timer values it wants to use=20
   and make the timer values in the draft as recommendations

Option b) could be better if the UA later on has some=20
mechanism (like STUN extension etc.) to ask the middleboxes
to adjust their timer behaviour.


Example of URIs for a proxy supporting all keepalive methods:

Outbound-09: =20
sip:pri.example.com;lr;keep-stun;keep-crlf;timed-keepalives;ob

My proposal: =20
sip:pri.example.com;lr;ob

Just guess why I prefer the latter ;-) Any comments ?

Regards,

Erkki

Robert,

I seem to recall from long ago that one reason for forwarding strays was 
to support restart or failover of a proxy, where internal state of the 
failed proxy is not preserved. As I recall, the expectation was that 
while things might not work as well as if the failure had not happened, 
the situation would be better than if these messages were not forwarded.

This is only a vague memory, so it may not be right. But if it is, won't 
the proposed changes break that? Does it matter?

Also, while I see some logic in not forwarding strays for the reasons 
stated in the draft, if that is a problem that needs to be solved, 
shouldn't stateless proxies also be banned?

	Paul

I guess a stateful proxy would only need stateless forwarding only in
the first few minutes of operation (because of timer C) - after that it
should have all the transactions. Not sure we can or want to ban
stateless proxies though. Isn't this "recovery mode" simply the same as
saying that for the first few minutes the stateful proxy acts as both
stateful and stateless proxy?

  Hi Erkki,
   
  I think you got a good point. I don't know what is behind the "keep-" parameters. But I don't see a real value using these parameters either. I agree with you with your approach. Here is some more comments.
   
  First, if the proxy supports all three kinds of keep alive mechanism, the client is free to choose the one that it supports. Then the keep-parameter is not useful.
   
  Second, the client should be able to detect if it's behind a firewall or not (by rport). The client may not send any keep alive packet if it's not behind any firewall. In such case, the configuration with "keep-" parameter would only introduce confusion.
   
  Third, if the protocol can solve the problem automatically, it would be better not to introduce any configuration. Right now, there are too many configurations already to deploy on any SIP set.
   
  Fourth, similar to the ";transport=udp" parameter which does not need to be configured in any sip set explicitly if the UA can resolve the transport type by using NAPTR/SRV (RFC3263). Therefore again, it's not necessary to configure ";keep-xx" parameter if the proxy supports all of them.

Hi,

I have today had a look into the fresh Outbound-09
to see how it addresses the keepalive issues in comparison
to the proposal I submitted originally in the beginning of
March and resent it yesterday.

My first questions are related to this statement:

Clients MUST support this CRLF keepalive.

If so, what is the value of promoting the TCP Keepalive within
SIP Outbound ? In which circumstancies an UA supporting TCP 
Keepalive would instead select sending CRLF keepalive ?


Further on, I like this piece of text within Outbound-09:

The client needs to perform normal RFC 3263 [4] SIP DNS resolution on
the URI from the outbound-proxy-set to pick a transport. Once a
transport is selected, the UA selects a keepalive approach that is
allowed for that transport ... 

That approach is elegant and consistent with RFC 3263.

But I still dislike these pieces of text:

... and that is allowed by the server based on the tags in the URI 
from the outbound-proxy-set.

User Agents that form flows check if the configured URI they are
connecting to has a 'keep-crlf' URI parameter (defined in
Section 12). If the parameter is present and the UA is not already
performing keepalives using another supported mechanism, the UA can
send keep alives as described in this section.

User Agents that form flows, check if the configured URI they are
connecting to has a 'keep-stun' URI parameter (defined in
Section 12). If the parameter is present and the UA is not already
performing keepalives using another supported mechanism, the UA can
periodically perform keepalive checks by sending STUN [3] Binding
Requests over the flow as described in Section 8. 

Outbound-09 suggests that configured proxy URIs could contain
'keep-crlf' or 'keep-stun' parameters, with which the UAs could
check whether the proxy supports the corresponding keepalive
mechanism before starting to send such keepalives. Instead of 
all that I simply suggest using the 'ob' parameter for the proxy 
URI to indicate that the proxy supports SIP Outbound and all the 
keepalive mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound for those transports 
the proxy supports according to DNS.

Rationale:

1. SIP Outbound anyway already mandates compliant proxies to
support all keepalive mechanisms (see section 5.4) so there is
no need to define separate flags for each of those mechanisms.
One single flag for Outbound support is sufficient indication.

2. The draft has already defined the 'ob' URI parameter and how the
proxy should use it. My proposal is to use the flag as defined
but additionally to bundle the semantics of separate keepalive
flags to this single 'ob' parameter.

3. The UA could check the presence of 'ob' parameter within the
proxy URI either
a) within its configured outbound-proxy-set; or
b) Path header received within 200 OK to REGISTER
(like suggested in section 8)

4. Simple is better: less flags to be introduced to IANA,
to the URIs or to the implementations. Resulting URIs
would also be shorter with this single and short parameter.


Finally I do not find any value for the 'timed-keepalives' 
parameter. It was agreed in IETF68 but I was not attending
the meeting and I have not seen the rationale for it anywhere.
For the proxy point of view what is the difference whether or
not the proxy URI contains this parameter ? If the parameter
is within the URI, the proxy can be sure that it receives
the keepalives with intervals defined in the spec but otherwise
the UA could select longer intervals. However the spec does not
specify any actions for the proxy to check how often it receives
the keepalive messages so what is the point to have such a URI
parameter ? Instead of that I would suggest dropping this
parameter and either:

a) mandate the UA always to use timers as defined in the draft
or
b) let the UA always to choose any timer values it wants to use 
and make the timer values in the draft as recommendations

Option b) could be better if the UA later on has some 
mechanism (like STUN extension etc.) to ask the middleboxes
to adjust their timer behaviour.


Example of URIs for a proxy supporting all keepalive methods:

Outbound-09: 
sip:pri.example.com;lr;keep-stun;keep-crlf;timed-keepalives;ob

My proposal: 
sip:pri.example.com;lr;ob

Just guess why I prefer the latter ;-) Any comments ?

Regards,

Erkki

I have a hunch that the problem related to the S/MIME and AIB  
dependency.

Anybody ever see an implementation of this stuff in SIP that worked?

My edge proxy might be provided by MCI, but I might be using a chat  
service from another provider overseas. This other provider might be  
willing to trust the certificate for authentication (given that I  
have a signed cert from MCI, who in turn has a signed CA cert from a  
recognized op-level CA). However, the chat provider might not be  
willing to just accept P-Asserted-Identity from MCI as an  
authentication mechanism, since said provider does not have a trusted  
peering arrangement with MCI and therefore ANYBODY could spoof my P- 
Asserted-Identity.

Hi, here are some comments to the draft: =
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt

=20

=20

a) Comments

[Page 2], Abstract

Can you add a reference to the corresponding RFC number? (RFC4474, =
RFC4484?)

=20

[Page 3], Introduction

Is this document only about assertion for the authorization or also for =
the authentication?

=20

[Page 7], 3.1. SAML Assertion

...including issuer, timestamp (IssueInstant) and subject ...

=20

[Page 9], 4. Specification scope

...SIP profile and binding ...

=20

[Page 12]

Domain name for Alice: example.com or foo.com?? (same comment for other =
figures)

Authentication service or Assertion service or both?

=20

[Page 13], 6.1. Assertion Fetch profile

Is this the only planned profile or will other profiles be defined and =
added later?  Will there also be a push based model? Will it then be =
"pushed" as part of the SIP message?=20

=20

[Page 13], 6.1.1. URN

What's the current consensus for the urn?

=20

[Page 17], 6.1.3.

...sender and Authentication service (AS) may be separate or... ???

How will the AS and sender be combined? Should it not be Authentication =
or Assertion service which can be combined?

=20

[Page 22], 6.1.4.1.4.

AttributeStatement is indicated. But what about Authentication and =
Authorization Decision statement?=20

=20

[Page 23], Step 3, TODO

I think it's always good to indicate problems with the assertion.

=20

[Page36], Figure 5

should de saml: keyword not be added for the XML elements?

saml:Assertion,=20

=20

[Page30] Security considerations

Is it possible to redirect messages to an own authentication service by =
manipulating the end-device? How can the called party trust the =
authentication service assigned by the caller?

=20

[Page31]

This RFC draft talks about assertions. But how can an identity be =
asserted only by considering a device, e.g. in case a device is stolen =
or temporary used by someone else? At VON 2000, H. Schulzrinne has =
already indicated that something as fingerprint has to be added for a =
device with a changing set of owners.=20

=20

=20

b) Typos

[Page 11], 5, =A71: ...because the those -> because those:=20

[Page 14], 5.1.2: ...Although this profile is overview ....->=20

[Page 21], 5.1.4.1: ....requirments .... ->=20

[Page 40], Appendix A: ...addtional. ->=20

=20

With best regards,

Marc Willekens.

Why not SIPPING, the home of requirements?

Yeah - stateless proxies have a similar admission policy problem for  
responses as they are
defined in 3261. You can address that (I think) without requiring  
them to keep transaction state
though (I think). It would involve something along the lines of  
providing bits to themselves that
they see in the response that lets them know this response  
corresponds to a request they actually
forwarded recently (it would require them to have a clock to  
reference, but they wouldn't have to
keep timers).

Hi, I have just submitted a draft discussing multiple reply-to addresses.

The I-D can be found at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sun-sipping-multiple-reply-00.txt

Abstract:

   This document defines extensions to the Reply-To header field for
   MESSAGE so that it can be used to specify multiple addresses as the
   target of reply MESSAGE.  These extensions include the use of
   pointers to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-lists in the Reply-To
   header field and the "multiple-reply" SIP option-tag.

Comments welcome!

Cheers,
Qian

The current policy of task division puts "security" in SIP instead of  
SIPPING. Although the task allocation is quite arguable on this  
specific exercise.

The certificate authentication would be used in place of today's Digest
authentication.

S/MIME and AIB were never used where Digest is used; I don't see the
relationship between what's on the table now and S/MIME and AIB -- except
that they are two certificate-based authentication schemes, S/MIME and AIB
are both intended to work end-to-end (between the two SIP peers desiring to
establish communication with each other), whereas the certificate
authentication being discussed is to replace ("enhance", whatever word you
prefer) the username/password digest authentication.  Digest authentication
isn't done between peers establishing communication with each other (except
in a laboratory environment), but Digest is done to authenticate yourself to
a SIP network so you can gain authorization to interact with that SIP
network --- and that's what's on the table for certificate authentication.

I do think that AIB was (and I stress *was*) potentially a tool that =
could be used in place of Digest, for example, for the registration use =
case. Nothing about that work limited it to the end-to-end case. Anyway, =
the new draft does insist that end-to-end is a requirement.

But that's not really material - my note certainly wasn't an attempt to =
rekindle or in any way glamorize S/MIME or AIB. It was rather a reminder =
that no small part of the reason why those mechanisms didn't set the =
world on fire was because of generic certificate enrollment problems, =
user mobility requiring mobile certificate management, the =
implausibility of certificates with SIP identifiers as subjects, and a =
myriad of similar problems that have little to do with whether =
authentication is end-to-end or what have you - they are rather rooted =
in the easily-underestimated difficulty of managing the relationship =
between SIP users, SIP devices, and certificates.

Jon,


But that's not really material - my note certainly wasn't an attempt to =
rekindle or in any way glamorize S/MIME or AIB. It was rather a reminder =
that no small part of the reason why those mechanisms didn't set the =
world on fire was because of generic certificate enrollment problems, =
user mobility requiring mobile certificate management, the =
implausibility of certificates with SIP identifiers as subjects, and a =
myriad of similar problems that have little to do with whether =
authentication is end-to-end or what have you - they are rather rooted =
in the easily-underestimated difficulty of managing the relationship =
between SIP users, SIP devices, and certificates.
[S] Would this not be part of the reason that we want to tackle this =
problem? There are large deployments which use certificates successfully =
today (such as cable clients). There are potential deployments which =
would like to use certificates for authentication in SIP networks, =
without a specified explicit way to do this (or perhaps, lack the =
understanding). Now, certificate management is a valid concern, and =
potentially a hard problem, but that is only one part of the puzzle (and =
may not apply to all deployments).=20
=20
I think we should start by identifying the requirements (since there =
seems to be some confusion; and the I-D has not been discussed in the =
WG) and see if existing or new solutions are required. And if we find =
that certificates need some work to support this initiative (e.g., SIP =
identifiers as subjects), perhaps we can present some of those =
requirements to other WGs. If we find an existing solutions that can be =
used, good (and we can document them as such :) ).=20

my note certainly wasn't an attempt to rekindle or in any way glamorize =

why those mechanisms didn't set the world on fire was because of generic =
certificate enrollment problems, user mobility requiring mobile =
certificate management, the implausibility of certificates with SIP =
identifiers as subjects, and a myriad of similar problems that have =
little to do with whether authentication is end-to-end or what have you =

certificates.<BR>[S] Would this not be part of the reason that we want =
to tackle this problem? There are large deployments which use =
certificates successfully today (such as cable clients). There are =

this (or perhaps, lack the understanding). Now, certificate management =

Scott Lawrence and I have spent some time on this issue, i.e.,
SIP identifiers as subjects in X.509 certificates.  The latest
version of the draft that includes pkix WG comments from Prague
and the comments of the sip WG ADs and others was posted
last week to the archives, and is available at
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gurbani-sip-domain-certs-05

Comments on this version would be extremely helpful.

Thanks.

I'm pleased to announce that the authors think that the SIPS draft is  
ready for working group last call. This draft has had the privilege  
of more review prior to WGLC than most of our other efforts, so  
perhaps it won't be too controversial.

Please make a final read through the draft and bring any comments  
back to this list.

I'd like to conclude this WGLC by July 16, 2007, so get your comments  
back in by then. And I'll plan to put some discussion time on the  
agenda in Chicago.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.

Hello,

Agreed. In addition, not having the RPH in the responses would mean the
proxies would have to maintain the state of the RPH value.

________________________________

From: Janet P Gunn [mailto:jgunn6@csc.com]=20

In working on specifying and deploying systems that will actually use
the RPH with the ets and wps namespaces, we have found several contexts
in which the RPH  on the response is very useful.=20

1)        Error reporting.  RFC 4412 does not give clear direction on
the treatment of RPH with syntax errors (out of range priority values,
duplicate namespaces, etc.)  We have found that including the RPH in the
4xx responses is usesful in addressing the errors.=20
2)        In our system, we often set the ets  RPH (with default
priority)  based on the "ETS-DN""dialed number" or uri, before
authentication and before knowing the correct priority value.  Including
the RPH in the response is a useful way of conveying the correct
priority value back to nodes earlier in the "call flow".=20
3)        Similarly, if an RP actor receives a SIP INVITE with the
ETS-DN, but no RPH it may, after authenticating the call, include RPH in
the responses in order to inform  nodes earlier in the call flow that
this is a priority call.=20
4)        If the RPH is being used to prioritize processing (of both
messages and responses) in the SIP user agent, including the RPH in the
response allows the receiving RP actor to give the response "ETS
treatment" before checking on the "state" of the call.  This is
particularly relevant when the RP actor itself is congested.=20

Right! I'm guessing there will still be a bunch of whining, at least 
from the usual suspects.

I'd just like to get on to talking about something else, including 
something that is actually useful to constructing secure calls - 
generally on a best-effort basis since that is all that I expect to be 
attainable for quite some time.

One qualification - the draft above is limited to certificates as whose
subject is a SIP domain - not an individual.  The goal is to clarify how
such certificates are constructed and constrained, and how they should
be used to authenticate that a server is authoritative for a domain.

Thanks to all who contributed feedback on draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.

I've extracted all the editorial comments and entered them into the tracker 
<http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/>

I've coalesced all the other comments into three broad categories of: 
substantive, security considerations, and clarifications (see attached notes 
file).

Given the breadth of the various issues embodied therein, I'll endeavor to 
initiate discussion threads wrt the latter, and from the discussions enter 
issues into the tracker as appropriate. And I anticipate we'll update the draft 
as a result of the discussions.

thanks again for the feedback,

1. Conveying SAML assertions via a URI in the Identity-Info header 
contradicts Section 9 of RFC 4474, which says that the resource 
indicated MUST be of type "application/pkix-cert".  ISTM there are at 
least a couple of ways to fix this:
1.a. Normatively update RFC 4474 to allow the resource to be of either type
1.b. Normatively update RFC 4474 to allow for a "multipart/mixed" with 
one part of each type
1.c. Add a separate header to carry the SAML assertion
In the interest of backward-compatibility, I don't think you can get rid 
of application/pkix-cert altogether.

1) I believe that it would be good to leave a bit the emphasis on
authentication and providing different uses of the protocol (or, at
least, specifying that it can be used to convey attributes, query for
information, etc).

- In my point of view, the draft focuses only on trait-based
authorization and tries to deploy trait-based authorization using SAML.
It does not try to specify SAML over SIP, which I was expected.
Therefore, it is more on an SAML artifact resolution protocol using SIP.
The term "artifact resolution protocol" is never mentioned in your draft.
And how is the integration of SAML over SIP which carries the assertion
in the SIP message, eg. using MIME multiparts. But I guess, this is now
concerned by the new issue 10 in
http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/issue10.

Security / Privacy Concerns:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. It's never made clear what entity is the Subject of the conveyed 
assertions.  This could be a critical distinction, e.g., if one party 
assumes that it's the UAC being discussed, and the other the user of the 
UAC.

2. Section 9 needs a discussion the nature of the assurances provided by 
SAML assertions.  In general, in order for it to be verifiable that the 
SAML assertion was issued by the Authentication Service, there must be 
proof that the holder of the private key used to create the 
Identity-Info header.  There are several ways to do this:
2.a. The SAML assertion is signed with the appropriate private key
2.b. An unsigned SAML assertion is provided over HTTPS by a server that 
authenticates with the same certificate
2.c. The Identity-Info is integrity-protected from the point where it is 
added by the Authentication Service until it reaches the UAS.

3. The list of threats and countermeasures in Section 9 is incomplete. 
For instance:
3.a. There's no discussion of threats of attacks by elements of the SIP 
signaling path (e.g., manipulating the URI in the Identity-Info header)
3.b. The anti-replay mechanism should reference the expiry elements 
built into the assertion (e.g., the NotOnOrAfter attribute)

4. The document isn't clear on whether or not the assertions MUST be 
signed by the issuer.  Section 6.1.5, step 3 seems to imply that the 
assertion will be signed, but Section 9.3 seems to assume that this 
isn't necessarily the case.  IMHO, it should be that the assertion MUST 
be signed by the same key used to generate the identity digest.  But 
even if this isn't the case, this point should be clarified.

5. No mention is made of the possible sensitivity of the contents of 
SAML assertions.  It's possible that these assertions could contain 
sensitive information about the Subject, such as statements about what 
identities the subject holds.  There should be some discussion about 
what measures should be taken in this case, e.g., the use of HTTPS and 
authentication of dereferencing clients.

Section 6.1.5, Step 3:
Section 5.4 of the indicated reference doesn't say anything about how 
signatures are verified.  Instead, this should reference Section 3.2 of 
the XMLdsig document referenced.  Also is this TODO resolved?

Section 6.1.5, Step 5:
Specify how this verification is done, e.g., by verifying that the 
signed-identity-digest and the signature on the SAML assertion are both 
verifiable with the key in the cert in the assertion.

Section 6.1.5, Step 7:
The relevant field in the X.509 certificate are Subject and Subject 
Alternative Name (not Issuer and Issuer Alternative Name).  The Issuer 
of the assertion is the Subject of the certificate.

2) The SAML assertion profile sounds weird, although I never completely
had a complete grasp of its meaning. I understand that it is connected
with the implementation, but it never actually had any particular use to
me (or I never gave it much attention). I rather see it as details that
developers had to apply in order to have the implementation working and
must be added to the specification in order to avoid interoperability
issues. 

3) I believe it is worth mentioning that one invalid condition locks the
whole assertion.

4) I also believe that is worth mentioning that the Identity-Info is
connected with CERTS and might go through deployment issues. 

5) Is there something missing on 7.1? Sounded incomplete to me.

7) The part of the AS as an authenticator and proxy could be further
clarified.

I'm personally missing scenarios which
- use redirection as opposed to proxy mode. IMO, it is beneficial to have
  the AS operated in 3xx mode for better scalability. 
- use SAML-by-value, in addition to SAML-by-reference. I personally find
  the SAML-by-reference quite non-real-time and harder-to-scale too.
Perhaps there are arguments why proxy+by/reference is the best thing, but
if that's the case I think they should be mentioned in the document.

Here is a review by Andreas Pashalidis:

----------------------

Here are a few small comments: 


"trait-based" authentication sounds a bit unconventional. 
Cannot you just talk about "attribute-based" authorization? That would be better aligned with SAML terminology. 


>From the description in section 5 and figure 1, it is not always clear
if you talk about an "authentication assertion" or an "attribute
assertion" -

Figure 2, step 5: is it possible to have multiple attribute statements
in the response? (for example, if possession of multiple attributes is
required?)

Section 6.1.4.1.4: what does it mean if there is no attribute
statement? is it an authentication assertion then? if yes, what would
be the authentication context?

Section 9.2: it would be nice to have some exaplanation there, without
having to refer to a different spec/document.

Figure 2:
In the INVITE messages, the AoR in the From: header should be 
"sip:alice@foo.com"

Section 6.1.2, Step 3:
The AS is supposed to insert "attributes required by Bob's domain".  How 
is it supposed to know which attributes these are?  This is answered by 
the following paragraph, which should be moved up to here.

Section 6.1.2, Step 3:
The AS constructs a "HTTP-based SAML URI reference" -- shouldn't this be 
a reference according to the binding defined in this document, instead 
of the original (SAMLv2) reference standard?


Section 6.1.3.3, third paragraph:
This paragraph gives the option of HTTPS or HTTP, but doesn't specify 
that one of the two MUST be used.  Suggested text: "The AS MUST 
construct either an HTTP or HTTPS URI per Section "3.7.5.1 URI Syntax" 
of [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os].  It is RECOMMENDED that the AS 
construct an HTTPS URI."

Section 6.1.3.3, fourth paragraph:
This is not technically correct; the URI should be the absoluteURI 
portion of the Identity-Info header value.

Section 6.1.4:
Through out this section, situations with exceptions are presented as 
"SHOULD ... MAY ...".  As I read it, this creates a situation without a 
mandatory default behavior; I would prefer if these were worded as 
MUSTs, with MAYs allowed under specified circumstances.

Section 6.1.4.1.3:
The SHOULDs in this section should be should be MUSTs.

Section 6.1.4.1.4, second paragraph:
This needs to say that the attribute-value pairs MUST pertain to the 
subject of the assertion (a concept which needs to be tied to a SIP 
entity elsewhere in the document).  This may be the entity identified in 
the From header, or another identified entity.

Section 7:
This binding doesn't really have anything to do with SIP.  Could we just 
exclude SIP from the name?  Maybe this could be the IETF standard URI 
binding of SAML.

Authentication service or Assertion service or both?

 

[Page 13], 6.1. Assertion Fetch profile

Is this the only planned profile or will other profiles be defined and 
added later?  Will there also be a push based model? Will it then be 
"pushed" as part of the SIP message?

 

[Page 13], 6.1.1. URN

What's the current consensus for the urn?

 

[Page 17], 6.1.3.

...sender and Authentication service (AS) may be separate or... ???

How will the AS and sender be combined? Should it not be Authentication 
or Assertion service which can be combined?

 

[Page 22], 6.1.4.1.4.

AttributeStatement is indicated. But what about Authentication and 
Authorization Decision statement?

[Page31]

This RFC draft talks about assertions. But how can an identity be 
asserted only by considering a device, e.g. in case a device is stolen 
or temporary used by someone else? At VON 2000, H. Schulzrinne has 
already indicated that something as fingerprint has to be added for a 
device with a changing set of owners.

Subject: [Sip] SIP SAML Draft Review by Sebastian Felis
Date: Wed, 27 Jun 2007 12:02:48 +0200
From: Tschofenig, Hannes <hannes.tschofenig@nsn.com>
To: SIP IETF <sip@ietf.org>


- Another topic is the usage of the term "Authentication Server" which
has the acronym AS. Since the term is originating from the trait-based
authorization draft, this term should be fine. But from the IMS
perspective, the acronym AS is "Application Server". By today, the SIP
(p)rotocol is more and more associated with IMS and touches the terms of
IMS. Further, the term Authentication Server is not a common term in
SAML. So I propose to use another term, which is more SIP/IMS and/or
SAML conform, e.g. Identity Provider in case of SAML.

thanks, yes this is definitely an issue. We'd noticied it soon after RFC4474's 
publication. There was a 3-message thread at the end of Oct-2006 discussing it. 
Hannes' final message..

   Re: [Sip] Re: wrt RFC4474 'absoluteURI' in Identity-Info header field and
   SIP-SAML implications
   http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg17101.html

..summarizes it well, and proposes essentially Richard's proposed 1.c. solution 
(note that the ostensible new header would convey a URI rather than a SAML 
assertion by-value (conveyance of complex objects by-value in SIP header fields 
being a higher-level (contentious) issue).

Also note that this is issue12 in the sip-saml tracker..

   http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/issue12


In his message of Tue, 31 Oct 2006 03:54:02 -0400, Hannes was thinking that the 
equivalent of option 1.c above would be the likely course of action.

However, option 1.{a,b} would be possible if draft-ietf-sip-saml-xx were to 
appropriately normatively update RFC4474 wrt the specific language of the 
second para of page 15 (in RFC4474).

What do folks think we should do here?

thanks,

=JeffH

        RFC 4916



        Title:      Connected Identity in the Session 

                    Initiation Protocol (SIP) 

        Author:     J. Elwell

        Status:     Standards Track

        Date:       June 2007

        Mailbox:    john.elwell@siemens.com

        Pages:      24

        Characters: 42924

        Updates:    RFC3261

        See-Also:   



        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-05.txt



        URL:        http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4916.txt



This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol

(SIP) User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to

supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the

reverse direction, and for that identity to be signed by an

Authentication Service.  Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming

request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives

it (the User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from

that in the To header field.  The same mechanism can be used to

indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some

action in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a

gateway.  This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).  

[STANDARDS TRACK]

I'm working on adding to (or possibly replacing) the current web site  
with a wiki.

I'll be using the wiki to do the SIP workup for IETF 69, and if it  
seems to be ok, we'll be expanding the usage over time.

The SIP wiki is hosted at:

http://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/SIP_Working_Group
or
https://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/SIP_Working_Group
if you're willing to trust my bogus certs.
