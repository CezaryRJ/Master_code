Hi all,

rfc4474 describes how an Authentication Service - which might be
implemented in a SIP proxy - can make digital signatures which provide
assurance for SIP applications that the asserted SIP identity is valid.
It recommends implementing this service within a SIP proxy since the SIP
proxy 1) is likely to have a private signing key, and 2) has access to
SIP registrar services.  It is the second part I have a question about.

If a network has a dedicated SIP proxy and a dedicated SIP registrar,
and a SIP user registers with the SIP registrar using HTTP digest, then
how does this help the SIP proxy validate the identity of the SIP user,
such that it can add a digital signature to SIP messages received from
the UE?  A few things come to mind:

* User can authenticates separately to the SIP proxy and create an
authenticated user session with it
* Something like IMS, where successful registration with the S-CSCF
results in an authenticated IPsec SA between the UE and P-CSCF
* Co-located SIP proxy and SIP registrar in the same box
* Others?

I'm guessing that the RFC intentionally did not address the "how" of
this and leaves it to implementation, just want to make sure I'm not
missing something.  Are there any other well known ways to solve this
other than those I mention above?

Tx!
adam

Such status code is not standarized:

As I see, 101 status code is used by eXosip SIP stack:

Hi all,

New to this list. Apologies if this question has been asked many times befo=
re (my searches showed that it has, but i was still unable to find a defini=
tive answer).
=20
The question is about SDP telephone-event (DTMF) payload negotiation.
=20
Imagine the following call setup between A and B:
INVITE A->B
SDP:
(among other media formats)
a=3Dsendrecv
a=3Drtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000
=20
200 OK B->A
SDP:
(among other media formats)
a=3Dsendrecv
a=3Drtpmap:97 telephone-event/8000
=20
The question is:
Is the above legal? I.e. is B allowed to choose a different PT than propose=
d y A.=20
In case yes, what PT should the telephone-events be sent...
from A to B?
from B to A?
=20
Please corroborate your answers by providing normative references if possib=
le.
=20
I studied RFC 3264 (SDP Offer/Answer Model) intensively, but could not conc=
lude for a definitive answer in that particular case.

Regards,
Lars Ruoff

 From section 6.1:

    In the case of RTP, if a particular codec was referenced with a
    specific payload type number in the offer, that same payload type
    number SHOULD be used for that codec in the answer.  Even if the same
    payload type number is used, the answer MUST contain rtpmap
    attributes to define the payload type mappings for dynamic payload
    types, and SHOULD contain mappings for static payload types.  The
    media formats in the "m=" line MUST be listed in order of preference,
    with the first format listed being preferred.  In this case,
    preferred means that the offerer SHOULD use the format with the
    highest preference from the answer.
...
    Once the answerer has sent the answer, it MUST be prepared to receive
    media for any recvonly streams described by that answer.  It MUST be
    prepared to send and receive media for any sendrecv streams in the
    answer, and it MAY send media immediately.  The answerer MUST be
    prepared to receive media for recvonly or sendrecv streams using any
    media formats listed for those streams in the answer, and it MAY send
    media immediately.  When sending media, it SHOULD use a packetization
    interval equal to the value of the ptime attribute in the offer, if
    any was present.  It SHOULD send media using a bandwidth no higher
    than the value of the bandwidth attribute in the offer, if any was
    present.  The answerer MUST send using a media format in the offer
    that is also listed in the answer, and SHOULD send using the most
    preferred media format in the offer that is also listed in the
    answer.  In the case of RTP, it MUST use the payload type numbers
    from the offer, even if they differ from those in the answer.

 From section 7:

    When the offerer receives the answer, it MAY send media on the
    accepted stream(s) (assuming it is listed as sendrecv or recvonly in
    the answer).  It MUST send using a media format listed in the answer,

 From the above, "the same payload type number SHOULD be used", so its 
possible that a different payload type is used. And if so,

- the answerer must send with the pt listed in the offer
- the offerer must send with a media format listed in the answer

It doesn't quite say that the offerer must send with a pt listed in the 
answer, but its clear for consistency that it should. That is widely 
understood to be the intent.

	Thanks,

That's how I understood it, too. But it seems that opinions diverge on this=
.
Maybe the RFC authors should insist on the above a bit more explicitely.

In retrospect, yes. But the RFC has been published already.
You can file an errata report. That will probably be queued pending a 
revision to the RFC.

Three questions about it:

(a) ISDN/SIP interworking spec [ETSI TS 183 036] proposes that in the 
Q.931/SIP interworking, some EIs Q.931 are codec to SDP and/or inserted 
in the SIP body as a PSTN XML element.
Under what criteria, an Q.931 EI should be?:

(1) Coding to SDP

AND / OR  (this is also important)

(2) Inserted in the SIP body as a PSTN XML element

or

(3) Coding to the URI SIP or and SIP header

or

(4) None (only interpreted by the AGW, without being carried over SIP)



(b) Why does [ETSI TS 183 036]define the mapping of the IE "User to 
user" to the SIP header User-to-User [draft-johnston-sipping-cc-uui-09], 
instead of transporting it over an PSTN XML element? (the IE "User to 
user" must be transported transparently by the nerwork)



(c) Although as optional, [ETSI TS 183 036]defines the coding to SDP of 
the "High Layer Characteristics Identification" field of the IE 
HLC[Q.931].According to Q.931, this EI HLC should be used by the 
end-to-end terminals, not by the LEs (or AGWs in NGN). Then:
(1) Why this SDP coding?
(2) And why is it optional?

Javi
