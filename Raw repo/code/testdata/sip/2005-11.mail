Hi Roy,

I agree that this should be strived for, but I fear that reality somewhat 
restricts
this idealism. Take the example of SDP being used to put a media stream on 
hold. 
Although this could be defended as being an example of manipulating 
session parameters,
this is rather arguable. The presence framework is yet another example, 
sending a
piece of XML data results in a response of another piece of XML data. As 
far as I am
concernced this is also "protocol tunnelling".

Any thoughts?

Cheers,

Frank

Hi Mariano,

I realise that I am treading on dangerous ground here, but I couldn't 
resist answering. 

If you are asking yourself whether SIP is appropriate for carrying
another 
"signalling 
protocol" is like asking "can I use SIP to do something for me". Most,
if 
not all, 
SIP implementations rely on the fact that some other protocol is being 
carried in a SIP
body. SDP and the XML used for IM and presence are good examples of
this. 
The SIP methods
that could be used to convey these protocols, is obviously open for 
discussion, but I
fear that it will be extremely difficult to come to real consensus on 
this. In the CSTA
case, I would say that, depending on what you are doing, both methods 
could be appropriate. 

BTW, Microsoft uses SIP messages with the CSTA XML variant for LCS.

3PCC is not quite as powerful as CSTA. Realise that "CSTA" covers a 
complete suite of 3rd
party call control functionality, whereas 3PCC "just" describes a method

by which a few
3rd party call control services could be realised. Precisely because of 
3PCC's limitations
TR/87 was created.

[Sip] About the ECMA TR/87 (aka SIP CTI Interface)

Recently I noticed the implementation of TR/87 spec in several SIP
Application Servers. My question (sorry it is out off topic for these
lists) is about if it is a right use of SIP according to the
architectural design principles of SIP and particulary, the use of
INVITE for establish a signalling session. I mean: is SIP the right
choice to transport another signalling protocol as CSTA? If yes, it is
INVITE the right method to transport CSTA information or
SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY would be a better choice? Finally, do we need CSTA
over SIP when we have RFC 4117 for 3PCC?

Cullen, Rohan,

I had a hard time understanding some of the changes to this draft. I think
it needs some more information about the reasons for GRUU and more
explanation of the pin-route option tag (not just behavioural requirements,
but explanation of what the mechanism is trying to achieve). Note that
section 14 provides a hint, but that text will not remain in the RFC.

I couldn't figure out the relevance of the first paragraph of 4.1. The
section is about forming flows, but initiating dialogs is something that
shouldn't happen until after a flow has been formed.

The first paragraph of 4.1.1 seems a little convoluted. First it says what
to do when sending a request with a Contact header when you don't have a
GRUU. Then it says you can't do this for an INVITE-initiated dialog. So why
not describe sending a Contact header without a GRUU only in the context of
dialogs that are not INVITE-initiated? What is it that makes the mechanism
unsuitable for an INVITE-initiated dialog?

Section 7 uses the term "SIP device" a few times without defining it.

Why does section 9 cover only flow-id, whereas section 10 covers both
flow-id and sip-stun?

Thanks,

John

Hi, Frank:

SIP also carries MIME format in its message body.

Carrying of SDP results so many things: audio, video, and others
streams.

Carrying of XML triggers many other activities.

There is nothing NEW about it in SIP.

But what does SIP standard stand for?

The fundamental thing is this: They all MUST complement the fundamental
objective of session initiation (especially human user in mind).

If anyone wants to extend SIP, let them come in the IETF SIP/SIPPING WG.
They are welcome, and standards are developed for the whole world, not
some abusiveness of standards as done in private arena.

Let them bring contributions in IETF and we can into those, and we will
go from there.

Hope this helps.

BR/Radhika

[Sip] About the ECMA TR/87 (aka SIP CTI Interface)
Classification







Recently I noticed the implementation of TR/87 spec in several SIP
Application Servers. My question (sorry it is out off topic for these
lists) is about if it is a right use of SIP according to the
architectural design principles of SIP and particulary, the use of
INVITE for establish a signalling session. I mean: is SIP the right
choice to transport another signalling protocol as CSTA? If yes, it is
INVITE the right method to transport CSTA information or
SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY would be a better choice? Finally, do we need CSTA
over SIP when we have RFC 4117 for 3PCC?

Hi Roy,

You are probably right about the process, but the SIP/SIPPING/SIMPLE 
workgroups
have not always been co-operative in these efforts. Some of the 3GPP 
efforts
demonstrate this. Obviously, that doesn't mean that anybody should then 
just do 
their own thing;-)

Cheers,

Frank

RE: [Sip] About the ECMA TR/87 (aka SIP CTI Interface)

Hi, Frank:

SIP also carries MIME format in its message body.

Carrying of SDP results so many things: audio, video, and others
streams.

Carrying of XML triggers many other activities.

There is nothing NEW about it in SIP.

But what does SIP standard stand for?

The fundamental thing is this: They all MUST complement the fundamental
objective of session initiation (especially human user in mind).

If anyone wants to extend SIP, let them come in the IETF SIP/SIPPING WG.
They are welcome, and standards are developed for the whole world, not
some abusiveness of standards as done in private arena.

Let them bring contributions in IETF and we can into those, and we will
go from there.

Hope this helps.

BR/Radhika

Hi Roy,

I agree that this should be strived for, but I fear that reality
somewhat

on

Although this could be defended as being an example of manipulating

this is rather arguable. The presence framework is yet another example, 
sending a
piece of XML data results in a response of another piece of XML data. As

Any thoughts?

The use of other protocols like SDP and others in SIP must NOT need to
be generalized by making a technically "wrong" interpretation such as
"carrying of other protocols."

Technically write interpretation of using SDP and others in SIP is this:

1. SDP and other protocols "complement" the session initiation in SIP.
2. SIP must NOT be used just another "transport" protocol for carrying
other protocols.
3. SIP must NOT be used to carry another protocol suits of "session
establishment" protocols that contradict the very fundamentals for which
SIP has been created as a standard.

If anyone violates the above items, definitely, they are abusing SIP
standards, and it must be stopped immediately.

Any comments?

Hi Mariano,

I realise that I am treading on dangerous ground here, but I couldn't 
resist answering. 

If you are asking yourself whether SIP is appropriate for carrying
another 
"signalling 
protocol" is like asking "can I use SIP to do something for me". Most,
if 
not all, 
SIP implementations rely on the fact that some other protocol is being 
carried in a SIP
body. SDP and the XML used for IM and presence are good examples of
this. 
The SIP methods
that could be used to convey these protocols, is obviously open for 
discussion, but I
fear that it will be extremely difficult to come to real consensus on 
this. In the CSTA
case, I would say that, depending on what you are doing, both methods 
could be appropriate. 

BTW, Microsoft uses SIP messages with the CSTA XML variant for LCS.

3PCC is not quite as powerful as CSTA. Realise that "CSTA" covers a 
complete suite of 3rd
party call control functionality, whereas 3PCC "just" describes a method

by which a few
3rd party call control services could be realised. Precisely because of 
3PCC's limitations
TR/87 was created.

Cheers,

Frank

Hi, Frank:

It is a simple process as follows:

1. Bring contributions in the IETF

2. Convince people that there is something needs to be done in those
areas

3. See which existing WGs fit to meet those requirements for
standardization

4. If item 3 is not a fit, ask for BoF for creation of a new WG

Unless efforts are made, nothing will happen.

I believe that SIP CTI interfaces may be a good area to focus on for
standardization because there is a definite market opportunity.=20

Why SIP should not be standardized to explore this new area? It is also
better for SIP because this is another "call control" area for real-time
communications.

Best regards,
Radhika

Or maybe we should make explicit what is implicit is Roy's description:
One brings a *request* to the IETF -- and the IETF might answer "No",
because what one wants to do might be a Bad Idea.  The difficulty with
the 3GPP efforts is that generally, they have come to the IETF with the
tone "This is what we are going to do, and we want you to certify it."

Folks:

In preparation for the SIP, SIPPING and SIMPLE WGs in the
upcoming Vancouver IETF, I have collated all the I-Ds to be
discussed in a session into an aggregate PDF file.  You can
access the PDF files from:

SIP WG I-Ds (2 PDF files, each corresponding to a session)
-----------
http://www.iit.edu/~gurbvij/SIPWG-Session-1.pdf
http://www.iit.edu/~gurbvij/SIPWG-Session-2.pdf

SIPPING WG I-Ds (2 PDF files, each corresponding to a session)
---------------
http://www.iit.edu/~gurbvij/SIPPINGWG-Session-1.pdf
http://www.iit.edu/~gurbvij/SIPPINGWG-Session-2.pdf

SIMPLE WG I-Ds
--------------
http://www.iit.edu/~gurbvij/SIMPLEWG-Session.pdf

You have 2.17 MBytes of data to read and digest ... but who's
counting ... ;-)

Enjoy.

Thanks,

- vijay

Dear Dean and Rohan

Thanks for your kindly put my request in the list :
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf64/requests.html

and also sorry until today it could be posted to repository after we 
negotiate
with secretriat many times:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yan-sip-cave-requirements-00.txt

I understand that you already announced almost final agenda.

But I still expect that this draft could be discussed in this ietf meeting
if there are still very small chance.

Best wishes to you
Sincerely yours

Binfeng

I assume that the following is  so understood that Jonathan didn't see
the need to write it down:

The primary purpose of Target-Dialog is to specify the dialog on which
the operation implied by the request is to be performed.  Target-Dialog
also has a somewhat secondary function of providing authorization, based
on the fact that Call-Ids are hard to guess.  (Somewhat like
"capability" based security systems.)

This seems to be clear from both of the examples in section 1, and also
from the name of the header.

It would seem to me to be an editorial improvement if this was mentioned
in the introduction somewhere.

And what should be the error response code if this target dialog is not 
found?

My first thought was "481 Target dialog does not exist", but 481 is normally 
received for either Call-ID or transaction mismatch. A 481 to a REFER (with 
Target-Dialog) sent within an ongoing dialog would be ambiguous. "403 
Forbidden" would not be appropriate if TD is not used for authentication, as 
in the remote-cc draft.

Cullen has (as agreed by the SIP working group) requested publication  
of the individual submission draft-jennings-sip-voicemail-uri-04 as  
an informational-track RFC. I prepared the following brief review to  
assist the RFC editor. If you see problems, please bring them to our  
attention.

----

The format of the document appears to be correct, and the idnits tool  
version 1.82 returned no complaints. The various boilerplate appears  
to be correct. The draft makes no IPR disclosures, and I am unaware  
of any related IPR that should be disclosed. The abstract, though  
brief, seems reasonable.

The examples seem to offer reasonable coverage, and are formatted in  
a manner consistent with "less formal" documents of the SIP working  
group, In particular, the SIP Content-Length header fields are  
elided, with commentary to that effect in-place.

The ABNF grammar reference given in the document is to RFC 2234. This  
reference has expired, and should be replaced with a reference to RFC  
4234. I believe the very simple syntax described in Section 7 of this  
draft is consistent with RFC 4234 to at least the extent that  
existing SIP syntax is so consistent, although I have not applied  
formal verification tools.

The IANA and Security considerations sections of this draft seem  
reasonable, and are consistent with regular usage in standards-track  
documents produced by the SIP working group.

The document, although intended for informative publication,  
normatively references RFC 2119. This requires us to consider  
carefully whether the language of RFC 2119 is being used appropriately.

In the one instance wherein the keyword "MUST" is used (towards the  
end of Section 10.2), the usage is effectively a paraphrase of the  
content of RFC 3323 and 3325, which are referenced in that section.  
As the paraphrase is accurate and consistent with the RFC 2119 usage  
in the referenced documents, I believe this usage of MUST to be  
reasonable.

Section 8 of this draft uses the RFC 2119 keyword "SHOULD" (four  
instances) in relation to a recommended mapping between SIP and PSTN  
cause codes. As this is supported through neither normative  
argumentation nor reference to a normative specification (it is a  
recommendation, not a requirement) I believe this usage would be  
better replaced by a lower-case "should".

Section 8 also uses the RFC 2119 keywords  "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY".  
These terms are also used in a paraphrase of RFC 3325 and are  
consistent with that specification, so I believe this usage to be  
reasonable.


I therefore recommend publication of draft-jennings-sip-voicemail- 
uri-04 as an Informational track document with the following  
"Instructions to the RFC Editor":

Section 8 of the draft uses the RFC 2119 keyword "SHOULD" four times.  
Please replace all four usages with the lower-case string "should".

Please replace the reference to RFC 2234 with a reference to RFC 4234.

The draft draft-yan-sip-cave-requirements-00.txt seems to be raising  
a requirement for an EAP extension supporting CAVE, much like the  
existing EAP extension supporting AKA as documented in RFC 3310.

One obvious question would be "And why can't you just use  
conventional digest authentication?"

Would the subject be adequately raised by including one slide (you  
provide the content)  during the chair's status report? Or is there   
a deeper discussion that we need to be having at this time?


Thanks,

Hi Jain,

Thank you very much for your reply.

There are a few more issues, on which if you could shed some light, it woul=
d
be
of immense help.

Issue # 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
In rfc3261, Section 10.3 Page 65 'Processing REGISTER Requests',

"The registrar checks whether the request contains the Contact
header field..."

here, what I understood gives the following pseudo-code segment :

if (contact header field is present) {
if (contact =3D=3D '*') {
if ((expires =3D=3D '0') || (additional contact header field is present)) {
Send 400 response
}
else {
if (Call-Id !=3D bound-call-id) {
Remove binding
}
else if (Cseq < bound-cseq) {
ERROR
}
else {
Remove binding
}
}
}
else {
/* General processing of contact field and update of binding */
}
}
else {
/* Fetching of binding */
}

Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect.

Issue # 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
In rfc3261, Section 16.12 Page 117 'Summary of Proxy Route Processing'
"2. The proxy will inspect the URI in the topmost Route header
field value. If it indicates this proxy,..."

My understanding of the purpose of route header field is to specify a next
proxy server (can be a loose router)
for the SIP Message to the proxy server. I am unable to visualize any
scenario where the 1st entry
of Router field can point to that of the receiving proxy, because at every
step it gets removed and the
next value becomes the top most value (next poxy for the next proxy server)=
.

Issue # 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
In rfc3261, Section 10.3 Page 62 'Processing REGISTER Requests'
"Each REGISTER message MUST be processed independently of any
other registration or binding changes."

Does this imply that the registrar must not buffer register requests in
attempt to answer
with 1 OK for several REGISTER messages for the same AOR ?
Ex: If a Registrar receives 2 consecutive REGISTER messages with same AOR
but different contact fields,
then should it send a single 200 containing 2 bindings or 2 distinct OKs fo=
r
each of the REGISTER messages ?
What exactly are the implications if REGISTER requests are not processed
independently ?

Issue # 4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
In rfc3261, Section 10.3 Page 63 'Processing REGISTER Requests'
"If the address-of-record is not valid
for the domain in the Request-URI, the registrar MUST send a
404 (Not Found) response and skip the remaining steps."

What will be the response status code when a REGISTRAR responsible for
domain
abc.def.com <http://abc.def.com> receives a REGISTER message
with :
i. To field set to user1@abc.xyz.com but Request-URI set to
abc.def.com<http://abc.def.com>
ii. To field set to user1@abc.xyz.com and Request-URI set to
abc.xyz.com<http://abc.xyz.com>

Issue # 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------------------------------
What will a dialog stateful proxy send back to a caller, from which it has
received a
BYE request to terminate a dialog which was not established through this
proxy ?
It would not find any associated dialog for that BYE request.

Any help with these issues will be very much appreciated.

thanks,
Rohan Sen

I remain troubled about the semantics of Supports and Requires. I think 
they are considerably underspecified. In this case I think the evidence 
and precedent is in agreement with Dean, but there are exceptions. 
Exceptions are the bane if implementors, so I would encourage creating 
no more of them.

Hi
 
I am trying to understand the the way UAC handles a SRV response.
 
If an UAC is trying to reach a user at something.com and does a SRV query
for _sip._udp.something.com and the SRV response comes with
server1.something.com (higher priority) and server2.something.com ( lower
priority),(after the UAC has done the A record lookup) would the INVITE
carry the user@something.com <mailto:user@something.com>  as the Request-URI
or would the Request-URI would be user@server1.something.com
<mailto:user@server1.something.com> ?
 
Also would the "To" field be affected by any chance? I would assume the To
field to be same and Request-URI to change but if someone can confirm the
true behaviour and also point me to the right document explaing it, it would
be great.
 
Thanks
 
Manpreet

Hi, Dean


> The draft draft-yan-sip-cave-requirements-00.txt seems to be raising  a 
> requirement for an EAP extension supporting CAVE, much like the  existing 
> EAP extension supporting AKA as documented in RFC 3310.

RFC 3310 is HTTP digest extension supporting AKA, which is different
with EAP extension AKA like IKEv2 EAP-AKA.


> One obvious question would be "And why can't you just use  conventional 
> digest authentication?"

Since there are tremendous subscribers of CDMA 1x, and they are currently
using CAVE, to ask them change SIM card is not easy work. Only China Unicom
is the only one CDMA 1x operator around the world using removable SIM card
like GSM/GPRS cellular phone.

As defined in RFC3329, four authentication mechanisms is supported by
SIP: tls, digest, ipsec-ike, ipsec-man. Currently none of them support
CAVE authentication.

Either to extend one of them supporting CAVE or to define a new CAVE
mechanism is essential to solve this problem.

If possible, to attract more attention, we guess that one slide is
not enough for raising this problem. If possible, maybe 5 minutes
will be enough.

Thanks for your help
Best regards,

Binfeng

Yan,
Please forgive my ignorance but I guess I'm puzzled why this issue is
not addressed within 3GPP2 where it seems to belong.

Perhaps I have not thought enough about this problem, but Supported and
Requires seem to be fairly simple to me --

Supported is used by a UA to advertise that it conforms to ("supports"
or "understands" in the vernacular) the particular RFC that defines the
listed option-tags.  Exactly what that conformance requires the UA to do
in various cases is defined by the RFC, of course.  Its presence in a
request does not place any constraint on the UAS that responds.

Requires is used in a request to modify the behavior of a UAS.  If the
UAS does not conform to the RFC in question, it MUST reject the request
with 420.  And so if it does not reject the request with 420, it MUST
perform whatever additional processing is required by the RFC.

Within this framework, what a UAC should do depends on its intentions as
to what should happen if the UAC does not understand the extension.  If
the UAC prefers the UAS to ignore the extension syntax elements (in the
default manner) so as to "complete the operation with diminished user
experience", it omits a Requires header.  If the UAC prefers that
instead the UAS reject the request, it includes a Requires header.
(These are, I think, Dean's two cases.  E.g., since all P-headers are to
be processed in the first manner, there is no option-tag for any of
them.)


So far, this doesn't seem to be controversial, and I think that all this
is specified or implied in one place or another.

If a UAS doesn't want to perform an extension when interacting with some
particular UAC, what should it do?  Ideally, the extension defines what
to do in this case.  Or it could reject the request based on
authorization; as far as I know, 403 is always allowed.  I suppose if
the request has a Requires, it can pretend it doesn't understand the
extension and return 420, but that is less useful (as 403 is closer to
reality), and semantically contradicts any mention of the extension in
other Supported headers.  Similarly, if the request doesn't have a
Requires, the UAS can pretend to not understand the extension and ignore
the use of the extension (though again contradicting any Supported that
it may have sent).

As an example, I see that in sections 20.4 and 20.9 of RFC 3261, a UA is
permitted to ignore the potentially hazardous headers Alert-Info and
Call-Info based on external factors.  Similarly, if there are aspects of
an extension that a UA might want to selectively allow or forbit, I'd
expect the RFC to make clear how a UA should deal with extension
requests that it does not want to honor for specific reasons.

To be honest, I'm not at all sure that a direct extension to support  
CAVE would withstand an IETF security review, although I'm sure that  
our security advisors could say more on that. Those guys seem to be  
deeply paranoid.  If there is a retrofit needed to secure CAVE to the  
level that IETF would endorse, I would think that would be in-scope  
for 3GPP2, not IETF.

The CDMA operators I know doing SIP appear to have successfully  
deployed using digest (which, while it has certain security  
limitations, is essentially well-understood and is already specified  
by IETF). Why doesn't this approach work in the general CDMA case? I  
think you could perhaps use CAVE-secured OTA provisioning to push  
digest credentials easily to the phone, and thereby eliminate another  
IETF dependency.

Yes, I believe this is exactly consistent with what I was trying to  
say. It's up to the extension to describe what should be done if you  
support an extension listed in a Require: header field but don't want  
(for whatever reason) to apply that extension to the specific request.

Otherwise said, what to do in this case is determined by the  
extension, not by the Require mechanism of RFC 3261. We have existing  
extensions that make different choices here already, and that seems  
to work ok.

But it would, I think, be useful to have a broader understanding of  
this concept so that the developers of new extensions can clearly  
document this decision in there new extensions.

I wonder if it's worth trying to tack something onto draft-ietf-sip- 
guidelines-09.txt?

Hi,

I think this is a reasonable place for the Area Director to
speak a little more.  There's definitely a precedent for making room
for existing types of SIM in the IETF-structured security designs.
But why is this an issue for the SIP working group,
once SIP has come up with a basic security design that has
IETF-structured security in it?

In my view, the Security Area needs to review your requirements
and then your specification.  I would recommend that
the document become an AD-sponsored individual submission, the
same way that Digest-AKA was.  

I would be happy to ask Russ Housley to adopt this work, and
ask SIP for advice to the extent any SIP issues come up.

Just reading a little, there have been enough attacks on CAVE, that
though it's widely used, the tradeoff for the specification will
be to make sure it states clearly what the risks are, and it's this
stuff especially that makes it a non-SIP Informational with a 
SEC AD sponsor.

One issue is the one that has been discussed in this thread: do Supports 
and Requires just negotiate the *availability* of an option, or do they 
also, in one way or another, imply the *use* of an option.

For example, the GRUU spec calls for a UA that has obtained a gruu and 
is inserting it as a contact in some request to insert a Supported: 
gruu. Recipients of such a request are expected to interpret this as 
meaning that the contact in the request has the gruu property. So in 
that case the presence of the Supported header is being construed to 
mean that the sender *used* the option in a particular way.

My other problem with Supported, Required, Accept, Accept-Language, ... 
is that there is no clear definition of the scope over which this 
declaration applies. Some possible interpretations are:
1) just this message
2) this transaction
3) until the time of some action that the recipient is
    expected to take as a result of this message
4) for the remainder of this dialog
5) for the remainder of this dialog unless
   overridden later in the dialog
6) for all messages with this UA
7) for all messages with this UA unless
   overridden later

OPTIONS requests are supposed to specify these things. That seems to 
imply to imply the scope must be 6 or 7. But even if that is true, how 
would the recipient know uniquely when it is talking to the same UA? 
Without that it can't know when its prior knowledge applies.

Which scope is correct affects when a UA needs to insert this 
information into a request. If a UA doesn't include all info in every 
request is is making an implicit assumption that the recipient will 
retain this information until the UA sends it again. You can't get this 
right unless both parties agree on what this scope is.

AFAIK this has never been made clear. I'm pretty sure if we took a poll 
we would not see any concensus. (Maybe we ought to take that poll. IMO 
the only answers that make any sense are 3 & 5.)

Hmmm... I was going to reiterate my philosophy that Supported indicates
conformance to an RFC, rather than a specific feature of a message.
That would be boring, but I think it might be an entry-point to the core
of the problem.

Using Supported/Required only in regard to the UA-wide property of
whether it conforms to an RFC is straightforward, and it dodges the
issue of the scope over with the declaration applies -- it applies to
*all* messages, though of course, whether it implies anything about any
one particular message depends on the RFC.

>From this point of view, using "Supported: gruu" to indicate that the
Contact is a GRUU is fundamentally broken, as the UA either supports
GRUUs or not, regardless of whether it has obtained a GRUU that is
usable for this transaction.  I would then suggest that GRUU Contacts
should be indicated by a field-parameter of "gruu" or some such.
"Supported: gruu" is just the signal that the UA won't apply the gruu
field-parameter without it meaning "This Contact is a GRUU".  (I seem to
recall somebody suggested this a while back.)

So I would argue that if an extension could be applied to only part of a
UA's traffic, there would need to be a specifically defined facility in
the RFC to enable it.

It sounds like it would be useful to take that poll, if only to make it
clear how confused we are on the subject.

Ok, having looked at the GRUU draft again, I'd like to consider this  
a WGLC comment on GRUU, which I shall paraphrase as "What do you  
mean, Supported:?"

One could make the argument that a UA that supports GRUU would never,  
for any reason, populate the Contact in a transaction other than  
REGISTER (or the 200 OK thereto) with something that is not a GRUU,  
and that one can therefore assume that the presence of Supported:  
gruu in a message outside a REGISTER transaction means that the  
contact is a GRUU.  But if one were to make that argument, one would  
need to spell this out clearly.

One might also make the argument that the user of a contact need  
(outside a REGISTER transaction) never know whether that contact is a  
GRUU. Rather, if it works, it works. So the Supported: gruu means  
nothing outside a REGISTER or OPTIONS transaction, and very little in  
an OPTIONS transaction.

Or perhaps one might argue that I've built a castle of fallacious  
logic around the use of SIP option tags, and they really mean "If I  
put this option tag here, I'm either doing or requiring you do  
exactly what that option tag means". This then raises the possibility  
that policy might say we "do" an option for correspondent A but not  
for correspondent B, which means the "option tag constancy"  
characteristic of RFC 3261 is incorrectly worded (and I believe I  
argued for this model during 3261, but that was a while back).

Understood.  The first time that we extended Digest, we did do it with
a SIP WG document.  It sort of booted the security design.  Because
the original question asked by the AKA folks was whether this should be
HTTP-Digest-EAP-AKA, and there needed to be some discussion about why
not EAP (that was actually mostly with the Security Area, I recall)
and then some discussion to make sure that SIP Digest use was well thought
through (this was in 2002, a long time ago).

But when AKA folks needed to do HTTP AKA-Digest v2, this was not done as
a SIP document.  It was done as an independent AD-sponsored document
with security review.

Yes.

I'd probably just do one document with both the problem statement and
the solution in it.

I'd do one Informational document that is AD sponsored, a non-SIP Informational,
similar in content to draft-torvinen-http-digest-aka-v2-02.txt, which was
independent and AD-sponsored, and which is about to come out as RFC 4169.

>From the looks of it, the I-D is close to what we've been discussing:

   Most other extensions of this type require that the server only
   insert the header field or parameter if it is sure the client
   understands it.  In this case, these extensions will need to make use
   of the Supported request header field mechanism.  This mechanism
   allows a server to determine if the client can understand some
   extension, so that it can apply the extension to the response.  By
   their nature, these extensions may not always be able to be applied
   to every response.

But I think that it would be good to see these conventions made more explicit.

Description of Working Group:
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) working group is chartered to
maintain and continue the development of SIP, currently specified as
proposed standard RFC 3261, and its family of extensions.

SIP is a text-based protocol, similar to HTTP and SMTP, for
initiating interactive communication sessions between users.
Such sessions include voice, video, chat, interactive games, and
virtual reality. The main tasks of the group involve bringing SIP
from proposed to draft standard and specifying and developing
proposed extensions that arise out of strong requirements. The SIP
working group will concentrate on the specification of SIP and its
extensions, and will not explore the use of SIP for specific
environments or applications. It will, however respond to general-
purpose requirements for changes to SIP provided by other working
groups, including the SIPPING working group, when those
requirements are within the scope and charter of SIP. The process and
requirements for such extensions are documented in RFC 3427, "Change
Process for the Session Initiation Protocol".

Throughout its work, the group will strive to maintain the basic model
and architecture defined by SIP. In particular:

1. Services and features are provided end-to-end whenever possible.

2. Standards-track extensions and new features must be generally
applicable, and not applicable only to a specific set of session types.

3. Simplicity is key.

4. Reuse of existing Internet protocols and architectures and integrating
with other Internet applications is crucial.

The primary source of change requirements to be considered by the SIP
Working Group is the SIPPING working group, which
analyzes the requirements for application of SIP to several different
tasks, including the tasks of standards-development organizations
that are developing systems based on SIP and that may require changes
or extensions thereto. Additional requirements are produced by the
other IETF working groups that are using SIP, including the SIMPLE WG
(which is using SIP for messaging and presence) and the XCON working
group (which is using SIP for centralized conferencing).

In addition to extending SIP as required to address these externally-
derived requirements, the deliverables of the group include assuring
capable security and privacy mechanisms within SIP and increasing
the stability of the SIP specification.

Specific deliverables toward these goals include:

1. Mechanisms for secure expression of identity in requests and
responses.

2. Mechanism to securely request services delivery by non-terminal
elements ("end-to-middle").

3. Guidelines for use of existing security mechanisms such as TLS,
IPsec, and certificates.

4. Guidelines for the use of descriptive techniques such as SAML
(Security Association Markup Language) with SIP.

5. Draft standard versions of SIP and critical supporting
specifications.

Other deliverables may be agreed upon as extensions are understood
to be necessary. Prospective deliverables will be discussed
with the Area Director before inclusion on agendas, and new
proposed work must be approved via a charter update.

Dean, Dale,

I asked a question about this on this list (28/9), which Jonathan responded 
to on 20/10.

In summary, I asked if it wouldn't make more sense to use a parameter in the 
URI to indicate that it is a GRUU, instead of the Supported: gruu approach. 
My reasoning was that the other use cases for GRUUs ( e.g. as contact 
element in PIDF documents) would not have access to the Supported: header, 
so clients using the URI would not know if it was a GRUU or not.

Another (implicit) reason for my question was my impression that the way 
Supported: is used in this draft deviates from the way it is normally used. 
"Supported: timer" for example means - to me - that the UA understands the 
headers defined in the session timer RFC, Session-Expires, etc., and that it 
will behave in the way described there. Supported: gruu in a non-REGISTER / 
OPTIONS request means that the URI in the Contact header is a GRUU - hence 
my question "why not mark it in that header instead?"

Jonathan's anwer was:
"We have in fact discussed this a few times. As a general rule, its 
preferable to not include information in the URI itself which describes the 
properties of the resource to which the URI points"

I understood GRUU as a property of the URI, not the resource itself. I did 
not receive an answer to that, and don't know if it would change the outcome 
of this discussion.

As to the second part of my argument - that for other use cases clients 
won't know the URI is a GRUU - Jonathan's reply was: "In all of these cases, 
I don't think the recipient of the URI would do anything differently if it 
knew it was a gruu, as opposed to if it didnt. A GRUU is just a URI that has 
the property that URIs in Refer-To, contact and PIDF need to have in order 
to work right anyway. To date, we havent had a way to produce those URI 
reliably. Now we do."

So the question is: would the other side (or proxies on the path) behave 
differently when the Supported: gruu header is present?

The motivation given in the draft-06 states: "[...] since the remote target 
used by clients to date has typically not had the GRUU properties, 
implementations have adapted their behaviors (oftentimes in proprietary 
ways) to compensate.  To facilitate a transition away from these behaviors, 
it is necessary for a UA receiving the message to know whether the remote 
target is a GRUU or not." (section 5, non-normative)

In other words: "Supported: gruu" is a signal to implementations to ~not~ 
"adapt their behavior". So the assumption is that they would behave 
differently without the "Supported: gruu".

If this line of reasoning is followed, I think it should be applied 
consistently. By implication it should also be indicated if the Refer-To URI 
is a GRUU or not, under the assumption that implementations would otherwise 
"adapt their behavior". However, this creates an ambiguity when Supported: 
gruu is used to indicate that: What if a request is sent with both a Contact 
and a Refer-To header, and only one of the two is a GRUU?

IMO, the usage of Supported here is questionable (with the exception of the 
REGISTER and OPTIONS requests, for which it does makes sense)

However, I'm not certain that we need to know that the URI has the

The open question is: would modes (other than registrars) really  
behave differently if they thought a URI to be a GRUU?

If not, then we have no need for the use of "Supported: gruu" as a  
hint, or to tag a URI as a GRUU syntactically.

If so, then we would appear to need a way, on a per-URI basis, to  
indicate that a URI isa GRUU.

Well, if GRUU =3D=3D  Globally Routable UA URI, and you treat a URI as a
GRUU which does not have one of these properties, things will break. If
you care when things break, you would want to know in advance. This
would apply to UAs, proxies, etc. You could make the argument that all
URIs should be GRUUs so what you really want is a property that says a
URI is *not* at a GRUU and assume all others are ;-)=20

RFC 3969 defines the IANA registry for SIP and SIPS URI parameters.

It currently says:

--------

4.2.  Registration Policy for SIP and SIPS URI Parameters

    As per the terminology in RFC 2434 [4], the registration policy for
    SIP and SIPS URI parameters shall be "Specification Required".

    For the purposes of this registry, the parameter for which IANA
    registration is requested MUST be defined by a standards-track RFC.

---------

Which IANA has quite reasonably interpreted as  "Specification  
Required".

It has been pointed out to me that the text in 3969 is self  
contradictory, and that the policy as interpreted by IANA is not  
exactly consistent with what we may have meant in 3969 (although I  
think I argued for a simple "specification required" at the time, I  
think I got out-shouted).


What we may have been trying to say is "Specification Required, but  
if that specification is an RFC, we want that RFC to represent an  
IETF consensus as defined by RFC 2434 (meaning that it has had IESG  
review and is appealable)."

Thoughts?

I haven't looked at that in a long time. It raises some additional 
questions in my mind. For instance:

    In order to achieve backwards compatibility for extensions that
    define new methods, the Allow header field is used.  There are two
    types of new methods - those that are used for established dialogs
    (initiated by INVITE, for example), and those that are sent as the
    initial request to a UA.  Since INVITE and its response both SHOULD
    contain an Allow header field, a UA can readily determine whether the
    new method can be supported within the dialog.  For example, once an
    INVITE dialog is established, a user agent could determine if the
    REFER method [12] is supported if it is present in an Allow header.
    If it wasn't, the "transfer" button on the UI could be "greyed out"
    once the call is established.

This implies that the scope of Allow is, or at least encompasses, the 
dialog. Similarly:

    When a body must be understood to properly process a request or
    response, it is preferred that the sending entity know ahead of time
    whether the new body is understood by the recipient.  For requests
    that establish a dialog, inclusion of Accept in the request and its
    success responses is RECOMMENDED.  This will allow both parties to
    determine what body types are supported by their peers.  Subsequent
    messaging between the peers would then only include body types that
    were indicated as being understood.

implies that the scope of Accept is a dialog. Perhaps I read too much 
into this language. But the emphasis that dialog establishing requests 
and their responses should include these things also implies that other 
requests and responses need not. But at best this is an incomplete set 
of rules.

I agree.

RCP 3427 / BCP 67, "Change Process for the Session Initiation  
Protocol", spells out the level of review necessary for SIP  
extensions, event packages, and lots of other stuff.

But it talks only minimally, if at all about "usage conventions" and  
"mappings".

As I've just learned following my review of draft-jennings-sip- 
voicemail-uri-04 for the RFC editor (we had thought this document  
innocuous enough to publish as Individual Informational), there's a  
hole 'nother category of "gotchas" that RFC 3427 doesn't cover.

It seems that anytime we do a mapping between an IETF protocol and  
some "foreign" protocol, even in something that's just a "usage  
convention", we have to be very careful. This is something that's  
hard to do correctly, and potentially politically charged due to  
relations between IETF and the standards bodies responsible for the  
"foreign" protocol.

Should we document this as an errata for RFC 3427, or what?

If we have evidence that unpleasant mistakes have been made in this
area, it's worth flagging as a potential trouble area.  But I assume
that you also have some idea of advice or even rules (of thumb) as to
how this problem can be resolved, which is what would be a valuable
addition to 3427.

Hi,

The following SDP message describes a MPEG4 video bitstream:

=20

m=3Dvideo 20000 RTP/AVP 98 34

a=3Drtpmap:98 MP4V-ES/90000

a=3Dfmtp:98
profile-level-id=3D8;config=3D000001B008000001B5090000010000000120008440F=
A28
2C2090A21F

=20

Does this SDP message describes the sender encoder generated media
settings or the required media settings on the receiver's encoder? Or
both? Can some one point me to the proper RFCs? I believe this media
settings is for the sender side, but  I can't find definitely
description in any RFCs.

Thanks a lot

Fan

Sir,

Thanks for the reply.=20

The following is an abstract from RFC3264 section 6.1 page 8:

"

The interpretation of fmtp parameters in an offer depends on the
parameters. Inmany cases, those parameters

describe specific configurations of the media format, and should
therefore be processed as the media format

value itself would be. This means that the same fmtp parameters with the
same values MUST be present

in the answer if the media format they describe is present in the
answer. Other fmtp parameters are more

like parameters, for which it is perfectly acceptable for each agent to
use different values. In that case, the

answer MAY contain fmtp parameters, and those MAY have the same values
as those in the offer, or they

MAY be different. SDP extensions that define new parameters SHOULD
specify the proper interpretation in

offer/answer.

"

Since the "config=3D" field in my example is specific configuration for
MPEG4 simple profile video bitstream, its interpretation should "depends
on the parameters", however, I can't find such interpretation in MPEG4
RTP RFC3016.

=20

Any of your advice is welcome!

Thanks,

Fan =20

Hi,

RFC 3264 specifies sendonly, recvonly, sendrecv and=20

inactive attributes. UA can specify any of these=20

attributes according to it's preference. When no such

attribute is present, it is assumed that the stream is

"sendrecv" stream and whatever the encodings specified

applies to both sender and receiver side.

With the current state of things, that would give many false positives...

What could be defined, is a set of criteria for a URI to positively 
determine that it is not a GRUU. One obvious criterion is if the host part 
is an IP address in the private space

Besides this, I think it would be wise to err on the side of caution: if we 
don't mark known GRUUs as such, elements that would behave differently have 
no way of determining that. What do we have to loose if we do mark them?

There are consequences:

- URI equality rules should be updated to say that if one URI is marked as 
GRUU and another is not, then they are not equal
- anywhere where URIs are being ordered (e.g. proxy target set), with 
q-values being equal or absent a GRUU SHOULD be preferred over a non-GRUU
- ...

Regards,

Jeroen

Well, if GRUU ==  Globally Routable UA URI, and you treat a URI as a
GRUU which does not have one of these properties, things will break. If
you care when things break, you would want to know in advance. This
would apply to UAs, proxies, etc. You could make the argument that all
URIs should be GRUUs so what you really want is a property that says a
URI is *not* at a GRUU and assume all others are ;-)

I agree with the assertion that GRUU is a property of the URI, not of
the resource indicated by the URI.

However, I'm not certain that we need to know that the URI has the "GRUU
properties". More on that later.

The open question is: would modes (other than registrars) really behave
differently if they thought a URI to be a GRUU?

If not, then we have no need for the use of "Supported: gruu" as a hint,
or to tag a URI as a GRUU syntactically.

If so, then we would appear to need a way, on a per-URI basis, to
indicate that a URI isa GRUU.

I am not sure I understand the concern about IPR here, and would like some clarification.

Both IETF and 3GPP2 have broadly similar IPR rules.

They both require IPR to be declared.

They both allow adoption of solutions that contain IPR.

Both organisations specifications are freely available without cost, and no charge is levied to implement the specifications by the organisations concerned.

I fail to see the difference. It depends on the decisions of the people adopting the solution as to what is there, and I would suggest that in your document, you have probably already gone far enough in deciding the solution that any IPR owned on the solution would become apparent.

As an example, I would note that most of the IPR in IMS comes from the inherited IETF specifications for SIP and associated protocols!

regards

Keith

Hi,

(cc also AVT as this is an AVT WG matter)

It took AVT a long time until actually offer/answer sections started 
appearing in the RTP payload formats. It is basically only the last year 
or two that they have been included.

In general parameters applies for the stream the offerer/answer wants to 
receive. However config is a bit problematic. It provides information 
that concerns the bit-stream that the encoder will send out. Thus config 
applies from sender to receiver.

This is at least spelled out in RFC 3016:

"config: This parameter SHALL be used to indicate the configuration
       of the corresponding MPEG-4 Visual bitstream.  It SHALL NOT be
       used to indicate the codec capability in the capability exchange
       procedure."

So the interpretation I make is the following:
profile-level-id in an offer for a sendrecv stream tells the answerer 
the highest level and profile it may use to send media to the offerer.

The config string tells the answerer about the bit-stream it will 
receive from the offerer.

The issue with all parameters that relate to stream properties rather 
than capabilities or reception configurations that the receiver can 
determine for the sender is that they are based on assumptions about the 
other end-points capabilities. The offerer assumes that the answerer is 
at least as capable as the offerer and can handle the config string.

I think it is currently unspecified if the answerer may downgrade the 
received profile-level-id to a lower capability in its answer. I think 
that is reasonable, but it do generates some issues in regards to the 
config string. Because suddenly the config that the offerer provided may 
no longer be valid. The offerer would be forced to re-invite with a new 
offer that matches the answerer reception capabilities.

If one is interested in how terribly complicated this becomes should 
take a look at the H.264/MPEG AVC RTP payload format in RFC 3984.

RFC 3016 would benefit from an update to include the necessary 
offer/answer section that describe this. So volunteers are very welcome 
to start this work. Simply contact the authors and the AVT WG chairs.

As the above is my interpretation, if the interpretation made in 
implementations differ, then that fact should be commented on.

Cheers

Magnus Westerlund
AVT WG Chair

Media Independent Handover (MIH) in 802.21 supports both models and this
show's the IEEE will support both "network based" control and endpoint
control in agreement with the e2e principle of the Internet.

Let's hope the IETF can also support the Internet e2e architecture :-)

Thanks, Henry

Digambar,
When you are referring to "unification," is your question related to the
ability of the core network to authenticate a user and deliver a VoIP
service independent of access technology or the ability for a device
access multiple air interface technologies to support VoIP?

BR,
Bjorn

After checking around, I think I have to say I'm wrong there.

(Although I think I could make a strong case that forking of non-INVITE
requests would be a lot more useful if the proxies didn't treat them the
same way as INVITEs.)

I have to think about this more...

Magnus,
You are dead on on the issues we are concerned about. Initially, our
understanding is the same as yours. However, when we proceed from
one-to-one video telephony application to multiparty video conference
application, the same understanding brings in some trouble.
Let's assume "MPEG4 simple profile level 1" is the negotiated codec.=20
In one-to-one video telephony, both ends can use different video sending
parameters, that is, "config=3D" or VOL parameters, both ends decoder =
just
configure itself to the incoming video bitstream's setting. In
multiparty conference, this means any one terminal has to configure its
multiple decoders according to different incoming bitstreams. This makes
the system a lot more complicated.
That's why we are coming back to the standards, to see whether there is
a rule that dictates that not only the codec type needs to be the same,
the video bitstream parameters (VOL) also needs to be the same for both
encoder and decoder.
Your suggestion/advice is greatly appreciated.
Fan

Hi,

(cc also AVT as this is an AVT WG matter)

It took AVT a long time until actually offer/answer sections started=20
appearing in the RTP payload formats. It is basically only the last year

or two that they have been included.

In general parameters applies for the stream the offerer/answer wants to

receive. However config is a bit problematic. It provides information=20
that concerns the bit-stream that the encoder will send out. Thus config

applies from sender to receiver.

This is at least spelled out in RFC 3016:

"config: This parameter SHALL be used to indicate the configuration
       of the corresponding MPEG-4 Visual bitstream.  It SHALL NOT be
       used to indicate the codec capability in the capability exchange
       procedure."

So the interpretation I make is the following:
profile-level-id in an offer for a sendrecv stream tells the answerer=20
the highest level and profile it may use to send media to the offerer.

The config string tells the answerer about the bit-stream it will=20
receive from the offerer.

The issue with all parameters that relate to stream properties rather=20
than capabilities or reception configurations that the receiver can=20
determine for the sender is that they are based on assumptions about the

other end-points capabilities. The offerer assumes that the answerer is=20
at least as capable as the offerer and can handle the config string.

I think it is currently unspecified if the answerer may downgrade the=20
received profile-level-id to a lower capability in its answer. I think=20
that is reasonable, but it do generates some issues in regards to the=20
config string. Because suddenly the config that the offerer provided may

no longer be valid. The offerer would be forced to re-invite with a new=20
offer that matches the answerer reception capabilities.

If one is interested in how terribly complicated this becomes should=20
take a look at the H.264/MPEG AVC RTP payload format in RFC 3984.

RFC 3016 would benefit from an update to include the necessary=20
offer/answer section that describe this. So volunteers are very welcome=20
to start this work. Simply contact the authors and the AVT WG chairs.

As the above is my interpretation, if the interpretation made in=20
implementations differ, then that fact should be commented on.

Cheers

Magnus Westerlund

I just made a mistake with the voicemail URI draft. I try to learn  
from my mistakes occasionally.

The rule of thumb I would suggest is probably "Any SIP-related RFC  
that specifies a mapping between an IETF protocol and an external  
protocol MUST be broadly reviewed, at least to the level of IETF  
Consensus as defined in RFC 2434 and preferably to the level of a  
standards-track RFC."

So, exactly what do you do differently if you think something might  
not be GRUU?

You've been given this URI. Don't you just have to try it and see if  
it works, and if not then back off to some other behavior?

Remember, there's really no such thing as an absolutely universally  
reachable URI. It might b a URI on the public internet that your corp  
firewall has decided to block. It might just stop working between the  
time you get it and the time you try to use it. The Net might  
partition in between you. And so on.

It's a procedure defined in RFC 3932, which modifies the procedure of  
RFC 2026. It allows for ADs to sponsor informational documents that  
are not in the scope of a specific working group, get the mIESG  
reviewed, and published as RFCs. It's preferred over direct-to-RFC-ed  
individual informationals because there is still IESG review over  
these documents and an opportunity for public debate that is not  
inherent with the direct-to-RFCed process of RFC 2026.

While the IETF generally prefers approaches that are not IPR  
encumbered, the presence of an IPR claim does not generally prevent  
publication as an informational document.

Very true. You can always try, fail, then take appropriate steps. I'm
just talking about short circuiting the failure. You don't know that a
GRUU will succeed, but you have a fairly high level of confidence that a
non-GRUU will fail. I really hope that this becomes the 1% case with 99%
of URIs are GRUUs. With that long term goal in mind, I'd prefer to
signal that something is not a GRUU rather than always have to signal
that it is one.=20

So, exactly what do you do differently if you think something might not
be GRUU?

You've been given this URI. Don't you just have to try it and see if it
works, and if not then back off to some other behavior?

Remember, there's really no such thing as an absolutely universally
reachable URI. It might b a URI on the public internet that your corp
firewall has decided to block. It might just stop working between the
time you get it and the time you try to use it. The Net might partition
in between you. And so on.

There is an example in section 6.3 of draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer-05:

    If the Contact URI of the Transfer Target is a GRUU (Globally
    Routable User Agent URI) GRUU [5] then the Transferee SHOULD use that
    URI as the Refer-To URI.  If the Contact URI is not known to be a
    GRUU (Supported: gruu is not present), then the Address of Record
    (AOR) of the Transfer Target should be used.  That is, the same URI
    that the Transferee used to establish the session with the Transfer
    Target should be used.  In case the triggered INVITE is routed to a
    different User Agent than the Transfer Target, the Require: replaces
    header field should be used in the triggered INVITE.  (This is to
    prevent an incorrect User Agent which does not support Replaces from
    ignoring the Replaces and answering the INVITE without a dialog
    match.)

Dean, Rohan:

Here are my WGLC comments for connect-reuse-04.

They are organized such that substantitive comments come first,
followed by nits.

1) The whole issue of "Directional Connectivity" in Section 2.2 is
best left to the outbound draft.  Currently it is discussed in
detail under the high order heading of "Problem Statement (Section
2)."  But connect-reuse does not solve this particular problem; so I
think it is best to take Section 2.2 out, and instead, put it in
the outbound I-D.  The outbound I-D does not have a "Problem
Statement" section and I think that it will benefit handsomely
from this swap.

Ditto for the last paragraph in "Clustering" Section 2.3.  This
paragraph is best put in the outbound I-D "Problem Statement"
section.

2) In Section 4, where the interaction of DNS and "alias" is described,
I believe that the use of "alias" leads to starvation of other
servers in a proxy farm since we have established an affinity with
a particular server.  Let me explain.

If within the Priority field of SRV RRs, the Weight fields are
the same (as is the example), then there will arise a situation
where the "alias" parameter will lead to the starvation of other
servers in a proxy farm.  Under normal circumstances, since the
Weight field of the SRV RRs is the same, traffic should be
distributed equally.  If instead, because of the "alias" parameter,
we do not use SRV, then only one host from the proxy farm gets
bombasted with *all* the traffic, effectively inhibiting load
distribution through SRV.

Do you see this as a problem?

3) In Section 3 "Requirements", Requirement 1 -- I am not sure why we
are worried about responses.  Responses tend to use the same
connection over which the request was sent (based on rfc3261).
It is subsequent requests in the opposite direction, and to a lesser
extent subsequent requests in the same direction that are a problem.

4) In Step 3 of Section 4.1.1, define "advertised name".  I think
you take this to mean what is in the sent-by production rule.
In other words:
   Via: SIP/2.0/TCP proxy-farm-a.example.com; ...
Here, "proxy-farm-a.example.com" is the "advertised name" ... yes?

5) I think a little bit more explanation around the example that
follows the 4 steps in Section 4.1.1 will help implementors in
gauging the intent.  Something as simple as replicating the
Via string mentioned before (i.e.,
Via: SIP/2.0/TLS proxy-farm-a.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK7c8ze;alias;
   received=10.54.32.2) will add some more understanding to the
example.

Nits:

1) Section 2
    s/connections instead using the/connections instead, using the

2) Section 2.1: I would suggest a vertical time-line diagram is
    appropriate for the call flow.  Something like:

                    Proxy A    Proxy B
                       |          |
   Create connection 1 +---INV--->|
                       |          |
                       |<---200---+ Response over connection 1
                       |          |
   Re-use connection 1 +---ACK--->|
                       |          |
                       =          =
                       |          |
                       |<---BYE---+ Create connection 2
                       |          |
        Response over  +---200--->|
        connection 2

3) Section 4.1.1: s/Finally, Verify/Finally, verify

4) Section 4.1.1: s/For example, take the example/Take the example

5) Label the figure in Section 4.  Change naming conventions in it
    to reflect "a1" and "a2" (which are used in the text) instead of
    "A1" and "A2" (used only in the figure).  Also, consider naming
    the boxes on the left hand side as "host-a1.example.com" and
    "host-a2.example.com".

6) Section 4 says that "The originator places their alias in the
Via header field value (in the sent-by production)."
Pedantically speaking the "alias" is not in the sent-by
production rule but rather in the via-parms, as Section 4.2
accurately reflects.

7) Is it okay to use 10.0.0.0 addresses as examples?  I
have learned that as per rfc3330, the 192.0.2.0/24 is what we
should be using in documentation and example code.

Thanks,

- vijay

I believe that is what everybody does in practice.  And we have sort of
given them permission to do so, since RFC 3261 says that Contacts should
be GRUUs.

the wonderful things about GRUUs, are that GRUUs are wonderful things,
there names are made out of URIs, but individual things....

While I agree with the sentiments the fact is that pre-GRUU devices will =
not be able to signal that they don't support GRUU and will not even be =
aware that their URI is not a GRUU.

Therefore are we not forced to indicate that the URI is a GRUU so we can =
tell between those URIs that are GRUUs and those that may not be?

Very true. You can always try, fail, then take appropriate steps. I'm
just talking about short circuiting the failure. You don't know that a
GRUU will succeed, but you have a fairly high level of confidence that a
non-GRUU will fail. I really hope that this becomes the 1% case with 99%
of URIs are GRUUs. With that long term goal in mind, I'd prefer to
signal that something is not a GRUU rather than always have to signal
that it is one.=20

So, exactly what do you do differently if you think something might not
be GRUU?

You've been given this URI. Don't you just have to try it and see if it
works, and if not then back off to some other behavior?

Remember, there's really no such thing as an absolutely universally
reachable URI. It might b a URI on the public internet that your corp
firewall has decided to block. It might just stop working between the
time you get it and the time you try to use it. The Net might partition
in between you. And so on.

That's just my argument. We lack a reasonable way to say a URI is a 
GRUU. Even if we absolutely knew it to be a GRUU, it might still fail 
for the usage. Old stuff will also never be able to indicate or know 
that a contact is or is not a GRUU.

So all we can ever do is try the contact, and if it works, it works, and 
if it doesn't, fall back to the AOR or give up.

cc-transfer and Sean indicate that if we know a contact is not a GRUU, 
we should proceed directly to the AOR without trying the contact.

But what if the contact is really reachable and would have worked if we 
had tried it? Aren't we shooting ourselves for no apparent reason?

For example, presume a jillion users in an enterprise.  Their 
contact-space is "gruu like" within their administrative domain, but 
they have a natting firewall between them and the real world. If you 
transfer a call within the domain, it works just fine using the Contact. 
Only when you transfer across the domain boundary does a GRUU become 
useful. Why do we want all of these transfers to proceed back through 
the gruu-routing proxy if they don't need to?

And how would they play in a P2P world? If given a Contact, do I need to 
use the full P2P search algorithm on that contact like I would on a GRUU 
or an AOR? I don't THINK so. Or maybe we do, in which the GRUU is really 
just a "parameter of the AOR", and we really should have been routing 
everything at the AOR instead of the Contact level all along.

Ok, I was just struck by an idea-pair. It'll sound crazier than most of 
my ideas (which says a lot), but I want to get it "out there" before it 
evaporates from my head. Feel free to laugh or ignore it, but there IS 
"something good" in there somewhere.

1) If instead of "proxy retargeting" things, we just pushed the new 
"handler URI" onto the route set ahead of the old target, we can clean 
up a lot of the insanity relating to retargeting. This gets back to the 
fundmental routing error in RFC 2543 that rewrote the request URI on 
every proxy hope. We sortof bandaid fixed this with loose routing, but 
it didn't go QUITE far enough. We can go a step further here: So far 
example, an INVITE may show up on my phone. By looking at the route-set, 
my phone can see that my AOR is the next hop. So, the phone lets me know 
I have a call. But if the next hop were, say, Jonathan's AOR, and my 
phone know's I'm authorized to take calls for Jonathan, my phone tells 
me that Jonathan has a call. On the other hand, say an INVITE lands on 
my proxy, and there's no next-hop on the route. The proxy then just adds 
my phone's URI (note I don't say "contact") to the route-set in front of 
my  AOR, and sends the INVITE on.

Visualizing this, a "minimal" route set on an initial request might look 
like "<domain>,<identity>" where "domain" points to my proxy. The proxy 
applies "contact" routing by transfoirming this to "<phone>,<identity>'. 
See how the TARGET never changes -- just the steps between "here" and 
the "target" change. There is NO RETARGETING, just the insertion of 
additional steps "in between".


2) If something needs to refer to a particular "contact" or "delegate" 
or whatever we want to call it relative to an AOR (what we more or less 
do with GRUU), we invert this logic by having a target that explicitly 
"hangs off of" an AOR. Effectively, a route-triple. My proxy acts on 
this simply by deleting itself from the route-set and passing the 
request on.

So if my phone knows it is hiding behind a "GRUU proxy" and that some 
particular request (for example, a transfer, needs to reach THIS PHONE, 
it doesn't hand you a "<domain>,<identity>" route set, it instead uses a 
"<domain>,<delegate><,<identity>" set. Or, my proxy could perform this 
manipulation on behalf of my phone.

Putting this into practice: Extend "Contact:" and similar fields to take 
a route vector instead of a single URI.

Side effect: This seems to fix the fundamental problem of Service-Route 
(which is currently defined on a per-AOR, rather than per-Contact) basis.

I agree with this, that is the intent of Supported/Require.

I think the confusion caused by 100rel is that the spec tells you that 
if you don't want to honor the extension, you "pretend" that you don't 
implement it, and thus reject with a 420. This, then, begs the question 
that Paul has asked about scope of Allow, Accept, etc.

I'll post separately on that in a moment...

That is the intent.

The idea is this - the GRUU spec basically says, at MUST strength, that 
you have to use your GRUU in the contact of dialog forming requests and 
responses. Supported:gruu implies ONLY that the UA sending the request 
supports the gruu spec. As a consequence, since the gruu spec implies 
that a compliant implementation also place a GRUU into the contact, the 
presence of Supported:gruu ALSO implies that the request contains a GRUU 
in the contact.

I agree that this has really become a mess. The idea when 3261 was being 
written IIRC is that its really (6), but this doesn't work awfully well 
since, as you say, you don't know if you're talking to the same UA when 
you send a request to a particular URI.

Most of these headers are inherited from HTTP, where they had two 
different meanings. Some, like Allow, were really properties of the 
resource itself. Others, like Accept, were useful for the transaction 
only to indicate what can come in the response. SIP "borrowed" these, 
but the different nature of SIP resources compared to HTTP ones has 
introduced a lot of confusion here.

The difficulty as Paul has pointed out is that support for various 
extensions, headers, and methods is ultimately a property of a 
particular instance of software. However, a typical SIP URI, an in 
particular an AOR like sip:joe@example.com, represents a user that can 
be reached at possibly many pieces of software. To make matters messier, 
software can also be upgraded over time, so even if a UA routed to a 
particular instance, these properties arent truly static.

Things get a little cleaner if you assume that an instance ID (in the 
gruu sense) changes for a UA when its firmware or software changes. In 
such a case, there could be a static relationship between the Allow, 
Accept, etc. values and an instnace ID, and you could cache that 
relationship. Using those values to guess how to construct a request 
would then only be useful when sending a reuqest to a known instance. 
That happens for mid-dialog requests, but also for requests targeted to 
a gruu.

One question, though, is whether it is allowed to indicate different 
capabilities for a UA instance depending who is asking. We have 
generally allowed that for other things, and allowing it here (as 100rel 
basically does) breaks the model that you could cache these properties 
as associated with an instance ID, UNLESS you basically changed instance 
IDs if you change values of Allow, Accept, etc.

We should definitely try and figure out what the scope really is and put 
that somewhere in a document, or at least into the bugzilla instance.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

I still don't believe its needed.

The reason is, that in places where a GRUU appears along with an 
alternate choice (i.e., a contact), you have the Supported header field 
telling you whether it is or not. In places where a GRUU appears solo 
(like a web page or in a Refer-To header field), you don't really have 
another choice but to just use it, so what is the point in signaling 
that it is or isnt a gruu?

The point is, the contents of Refer-To, Contact and so on are SUPPOSED 
to have the gruu property to begin with; the problem is we never had a 
way for that to be an easily guaranteed property.

The gruu draft acknowledges that direct signaling is lost with gruu, and 
that this would be revisited at some point in the future.

Wow - shocking timing here - I more or less posted this same idea on the

thought that Dean and I are thinking alike... next thing you know I'll 
want to deprecate forking....

I think it adds your contact URI as a Route value, but the AOR wouldn't 
be there. The R-URI remains as the identifier of the target. The route 
set tells you how to get there, including the endpoint itself.

I think the way it works is that an initial request is like:

INVITE AOR

and then every time a next hop needs to be reached, its added as a route 
header field value, including the endpoint contact itself.

No, that I disagree with. One of the things we discussed early on in the 
design of gruu was simulating the effect with embedded Route headers, 
basically what you are describing it. We discarded that, because you 
want to apply service treatment and other logic to the GRUU, and to do 
that you really need it to be a separate resource.

I think the issue of gruu is orthogonal to this idea of putting the 
endpoint hop in a route header. So, if I send a request to a gruu, and 
that gruu is bound to contact sip:ua-contact, the initial INVITE would 
look like:

INVITE sip:gruu

and then this arrives at the proxy, which does this:

INVITE sip:gruu
Route: sip:ua-contact

Err, you lost me there. Service route (and Path) remain broken AFAICT...

Jonathan,

What about a PIDF document with one or more contact elements and a pres: 
URI?
Similar to the example in section 6.3 of draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer-05 
that Paul mentioned, there is a choice (both amongst contacts and between 
contact / pres: URI if the contact is not a GRUU)

Regards,
Jeroen

  While the IETF generally prefers approaches that are not IPR encumbered, 
the presence of an IPR claim does not generally prevent publication as an

  I am not sure I understand the concern about IPR here, and would like some 
clarification.

  Both IETF and 3GPP2 have broadly similar IPR rules.

  They both require IPR to be declared.

  They both allow adoption of solutions that contain IPR.

  Both organisations specifications are freely available without cost, and 
no charge is levied to implement the specifications by the organisations 
concerned.

  I fail to see the difference. It depends on the decisions of the people 
adopting the solution as to what is there, and I would suggest that in your 
document, you have probably already gone far enough in deciding the solution 
that any IPR owned on the solution would become apparent.

  As an example, I would note that most of the IPR in IMS comes from the 
inherited IETF specifications for SIP and associated protocols!

  regards

  Keith

Yes, the Sup/Req/Acc/Acc-L headers have this problem with temporal
duration and scope. But they have another problem that digs deeper into
the biggest flaw of SIP, in my opinion:  SIP does a lousy job of
separating the functional layers of the network. Sip wants to be
your network connection (INVITE/OK/ACK), your discovery channel
(300 redirects and forking proxies), your router control protocol
(Route/RecordRoute), and your transport mechanism (SDP, etc), and your
session control manager(dialogs), all in one iddy-biddy packet.

Actually, the fact that it is all in one packet is not the problem.
That there is not a clearer definition of layered responsibilities is
the issue.

In fact SIP manages to do all this stuff amazingly well most of the
time,
and a hats off to everyone for that.

However, unless you can delineate these functionalities better, the
scope
of Sup/Req/Acc/Acc-L will remain fuzzy.

But again, what choice do you have? You can use the <contact> in the 
pidf document to reach that service, and thats it. There isn't going to 
be an alternate URI for that service that you could try.

Sorry I replied without having correctly understood your response.

The pres URI is not going to be suitable for reaching the service, since 
its not a service URI at all. Its an identifier for the presentity. You 
might try different services, sure, but those don't represent an 
alternative for reaching the service you have chosen. If you knew that 
the <contact> for some service wasn't a gruu, would that mean you'd give 
up and use a different service entirely? No. You'd try the service you 
want, and if it can't be reached (timeout or whatever), you'd then try 
something else. No need to know whether the <contact> is a gruu or not.

I don't see that you can avoid this. You anyway need to save the per 
stream decoder state, thus all active participants will result in state 
on the receiver side.

However isn't the real issue in multi-party that in many of the setup 
scenarios you are not able to describe in the answer more than a single 
configuration. Thus you are forced to use the inband transport that is 
not as robust.

To my knowledge this is not possible. However input from video coding 
experts are solicited.

Magnus,
As you pointed out, inband transport of VOL headers may be one solution.
We also have explored this possibility. However, due to possible loss of
RTP packets, this may cause corrupted images for one whole GOP, which
can be several seconds long.=20
It looks like the current standards don't have a satisfactory solution
to our problem. We are now looking for proprietary methods.
Thanks for your wonderful comments and advices.
Fan

I don't see that you can avoid this. You anyway need to save the per=20
stream decoder state, thus all active participants will result in state=20
on the receiver side.

However isn't the real issue in multi-party that in many of the setup=20

I was thinking about a PIDF document with 2 contact entries, one for an 
older device that does not support GRUUs (and published a non-GRUU) and one 
for a newer one. Sure, you can always use trial-and-error, which is what 
current implementations will do anyway. Having a GRUU-indication would make 
little - but not 0 - difference

What bothers me is not if GRUUs are recognisable or not, but more the 
inconsistency of doing it in some cases (dialog-creating requests and 
responses) and not in others.

The current Supported: mechanism is mixing two things - support for GRUUs 
and their usage. What if the UAC does not manage to obtain a GRUU, e.g. 
because the registrar does not support it? Then it could not insert a 
Supported header anymore, because that would be interpreted as Contact=GRUU. 
So from the other side the UAC seems to have lost support for GRUUs?

Well, firstly to be clear, a "device" is not represented in a presence 
document through a SIP URI. If you are talking about a "service" (i.e., 
a <tuple>), I doubt that the element which constructs the presence 
document would do it with something that doesn't at least have the 
property that it works for recipients; typically if a GRUU is not there 
it would be an AOR.

Well, I tihnk the real problem is that, to date, folks have not included 
URI in Contact with the gruu property, and so implementations have had 
to resort to hacks. The GRUU spec makes the need for the hacks go away - 
things should work as they originally should have. So, it seems wrong to 
me to hard-code into the URI a flag which merely says that you don't 
need to do the hacks that you needed to do before.

Ah, now that is a good point.

If this happens, then there is a difference between the presence of the 
Supported header field and whether or not the contact is a gruu.

I would still argue against a specific URI parameter for this, however. 
We want to be moving AWAY from telling people to try various tricks to 
get a URI to work. It ought to just work - thats what gruu allows. As 
such, in the case above, I'd still argue that the right thing is to try 
the contact URI, as it may work anyway...

I think I'm OK with this, but the gruu text should make this more clear.

1) if the Contact: actually included the entire route from the  
serving proxy to the UA, including the UA's URI, then Contact  
essentially does " Path".

2) If the contact: actually included the entire route from the UA to  
the serving proxy, it essentially does "Service-Route".

So if I register, and the registrar stores both #1 and #2 "Contacts"  
for my AOR, uses #1 contacts to "reach" my UA, and returns #2  
contacts in the 200 OK response for use by my UA, we need neither  
Path nor Service-Route.

OK, so in that case: what if we just let Supported: gruu mean what it says - 
that the UAC supports GRUUs, in the sense that it knows how to request them 
from a registrar and to use them as Contact when available. Supported would 
not be a guarantee that the Contact is a GRUU (but does make it more 
likely), its absence means that the Contact was not obtained from a 
registrar or provisioned administratively as a GRUU (but may still work).

A UAC MUST use a GRUU as Contact, that is when it is provided with one. It 
MUST insert Supported: gruu in all dialog-creating requests and responses 
(btw, in addition to 2xx responses to INVITE I think it should also be 
included in 1xx responses with a to-tag, in particular 100rel responses)

Implementations SHOULD assume that Contacts are GRUUs (and act accordingly), 
regardless of the presence or absence of a Supported: gruu header. In 
particular, the Refer-To example SHOULD use the Contact URI (this leaves 
some room for implementations to deviate, if they really see a need)

PS I like the suggestion of loose contact routing, as a side effect it would 
obviate the need for special handling of the 'grid' parameter

Thanks for putting this together. As I have posted previously, I support 
work in this area.

On the mechanism itself, I prefer the approach that the connected-party 
identity is conveyed in the To header field in the response of the 
dialog forming request. This DOES mean that you will modify the URI in 
the response from the request. Though they are supposed to be the same 
(and also in subsequent requests in the reverse direction), 3261 
recognizes that this may change. Note Section 12.2.1.1:

       Usage of the URI from the To and From fields in the original
       request within subsequent requests is done for backwards
       compatibility with RFC 2543, which used the URI for dialog
       identification.  In this specification, only the tags are used for
       dialog identification.  It is expected that mandatory reflection
       of the original To and From URI in mid-dialog requests will be
       deprecated in a subsequent revision of this specification.


To support modifying the identity, an UPDATE can be sent with a new From 
header field.

I do believe an UPDATE without an SDP is acceptable. Indeed, the 
original design of UPDATE was to allow both session updates and other 
updates. UPDATE had been conceived as a fix to the HERFP problem as 
well, in which case its purpose was to update non-session stuff. Note 
that, if an UPDATE contains no SDP, there would be no SDP in the 200 OK. 
Unlike INVITE< there is no ACK which would allow an offer/answer 
exchange to start with an offer in a response.

Using To/From means that we don't need to invent new header fields and 
define a variation of the authentication service which is the same in 
every way as the one in draft-ietf-sip-identity, but differs in the 
field names. We can just reuse the identity service as defined.

I think its important to mention in the security considerations section 
that this mechanism provides no protection whatsoever against malicious 
forwarding. It provides no way to know whether the call went to the 
intended recipient or not. The only way to determine whether or not the 
response identity is to be trusted is based on the trustworthiness of 
the domain that has signed the response. This does mean that a 
subscriber could provide their own authentication service and place an 
Identity in a response; such identities should be stripped out and 
re-created by the proxy for the domain. However, if a domain does not 
perform such stripping (presumably because it doesnt implement response 
identity at all), the user can assert whatever identity they like within 
domains for which they can obtain a certificate. Of course, that is no 
different than request identity.

Two issues...

This is very difficult to implement for most people. If you do a DNS lookup
of an A record, this requires you to get every IP address then look at your
alias to see if you have one that matches - and not do load balancing. This
is hard unless you have your own DNS resolve library which most people do
not.

Second, I don't think it works. If a server runs two virtual domain a.com
and b.com both on 1.2.3.4:5060 and use the TLS extended hello to separate
them, then if it connects to C as A.com, and later C wants to send a sips
message to B.com, it will deliver it over the connection to A.com which is
totally broken from a security point of view.

[JRE] I would very much like to go in this direction, but I feared there was
too much opposition at an earlier IETF.

And in the Refer-To of REFER? And in *all* the Contacts of a 3xx? And in 
???.

What happens when there are multiple addresses in the message and only 
some of them are known to have the GRUU property?

For instance, suppose I'm sending a REFER, and I know the Refer-To is a 
gruu, but I wasn't able to get a gruu for the Contact in my own REFER? 
Do I put a Supported: gruu in the REFER request?

In some cases, whether something is supported depends on context - the 
same UA may support it in one context, but not another. The Accept 
header is a good case of this: I might Accept SDP in INVITE, UPDATE, 
PRACK, and their responses, but not in other places. Or I might support 
multipart/alternative in MESSAGE but not elsewhere.

That could help.

I didn't follow that. If I am disclosing capabilities, and do so 
differently when talking to X than Y, then I see no problem with X and Y 
caching those results as long as I am consistent in what I report to 
each of them.

Yeah, as things stand nobody knows when they should/needn't insert these 
headers, and nobody knows how to remember them. This doesn't bode well 
for interoperability.

In principal this is a problem. Is it true in practice? If a particular 
extension can (according to the spec), be used with INVITE and UPDATE, 
and an implementation supports the spec, are there implementations that 
would only use it for INVITE and not UPDATE?

My suspicion is that this is actually rare, and furthermore, that when 
it does happen, you really need to view it differently. The UA does 
SUPPORT the extension, it just elects not to utilize it.

Fair point. The bigger problem is if you change what you said to a 
particular caller, without changing instance ID.

In principal I suppose. I'm curious if anyone has seen interop problems 
in the wild as a consequence of this...

I suspect this is not a problem with options. But I think it is very 
likely a problem with content types.

Consider a softphone that supports INVITE and MESSAGE. If done on a 
UA-wide basis, I think it must say

    Accept: application/sdp, text/plain

But what is it going to do if I send it a MESSAGE containing an SDP 
body? It probably can't accept it. If it wants to refuse it, what error 
can it return? I think it must return 415:

    21.4.13 415 Unsupported Media Type

    The server is refusing to service the request because the message
    body of the request is in a format not supported by the server for
                                                                   ^^^
    the requested method.  The server MUST return a list of acceptable
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    formats using the Accept, Accept-Encoding, or Accept-Language header
    field, depending on the specific problem with the content.  UAC
    processing of this response is described in Section 8.1.3.5.

In that response it would have to include a new Accept header:

    Accept: text/plain

to indicate what is valid for the MESSAGE. But this too is not clearly 
scoped to apply to the particular message.

Yes, I too am curious. Maybe it doesn't matter because nobody conditions 
their behavior on what they receive this way.

I recall controversy as well, but I can't think of a reason why this

I don't follow you here. Refer-To is different; this doesn't usually 
contain MY URI, its someone elses that is pulled from somewhere 
(Contact). Whether you'd place your own gruu into a redirect, I don't 
know of a user case for that.

We're only talking about contact.

Supported: gruu means that the endpoints supports GRUU, and that as a 
consequence, the Contact in dialog forming requests (like REFER) will 
contain a gruu for the UAC. Supported:gruu says NOTHIGN about the 
contents of Refer-To since the GRUU spec isn't about that.

Yes.

Yes.

Well, here I would rather have the draft say that presence of Supported: 
gruu is a strong hint that the contact is a gruu, and that endpoints 
using such cotnacs for new requests will have a high likelihood of those 
working, and then leave it at that.


  In particular, the Refer-To example SHOULD use the Contact URI

I am thinking now that usage of the Contact for other things, like 
REFER, should not be the problem of the gruu spec..

Yes, I realized that as well.

Hi Jim,
   It appears that you Content -Disposition header example is fine:
Section 25.1 of RFC 3261 defines the Header as below :
=20
Content-Disposition   =3D  "Content-Disposition" HCOLON
                         disp-type *( SEMI disp-param )
disp-type             =3D  "render" / "session" / "icon" / "alert"
                         / disp-extension-token

disp-param            =3D  handling-param / generic-param
handling-param        =3D  "handling" EQUAL
                         ( "optional" / "required"
                         / other-handling )
other-handling        =3D  token
disp-extension-token  =3D  token

Thanks,
Regards,

I've been trying to fully understand the solution to the "edge router"
problem that is described in section 8.4.2 of draft-ietf-sip-gruu-06.
One component of the solution is described at the top of page 25:

   Similarly, if a request arrives from the client towards the home
   proxy, the edge proxy would look at the identity of the sender of the
   request.  If the proxy knows that it is placing itself on the Path
   for registrations from that AOR, and the request contains a Supported
   header field with the value "gruu", the edge proxy would insert a
   Record-Route into the request, and then remove it in the response.

I believe that this description is incorrect, in fact reversed from the
behavior that is desired.  I've charted the message flows for dialog-
establishing messages in the edge-router situation, and the route-sets
that we want established at the ends of the dialog.  From the route-
sets, one can determine the manipulations that the edge router must
perform on the request and response.

The message flows are in an attachment to this message.

>From the message flow, it seems to me that the above quoted paragraph is
incorrect, and should be written as

   Similarly, if a request arrives from the client towards the home
   proxy, the edge proxy would look at the identity of the sender of the
   request.  If the proxy knows that it is placing itself on the Path
   for registrations from that AOR, and the request contains a Supported
   header field with the value "gruu", the edge proxy would not insert a
   Record-Route into the request, but would rather insert it into the response.

I fear that I may be overlooking something here and making a fool of
myself, but I've checked this over, and I think that this is a bug in
the text of the I-D.

Picking up on a slightly-related discussion at the SIP meeting. An 
emerging consensus for marking emergency calls is to use the urn:service 
URN (see related draft). However, for backward-compatibility, we need to 
deal with phones that will issue requests such as

INVITE sip:911@example.com;user=phone
To: sip:911@example.com;user=phone

which the outbound proxy should then translate to

INVITE urn:service:sos
To: urn:service:sos

or

INVITE sip:psap@some-psap.gov
To: urn:service:sos

if that outbound proxy also does a PSAP look up. Any comments on this 
approach? (I find it somewhat distasteful.)

In general, the goals are to be able to
- distinguish emergency calls
- and detect if a location-to-URL translation has already taken place 
(we don't want to do this several times)

As a side note, this is also applicable to other services beyond 
emergency calling.

One alternative is to use a pre-loaded Route to urn:service:sos added by 
the outbound proxy.

Advice appreciated.

Henning

I know we started to open the door to changing To and From, but did we 
really agree to allow *proxies* to change them???

Why is it important to have the value in To?

On that theme, how about:

INVITE sip:911@example.com;user=phone
To: sip:911@example.com;user=phone

which the outbound proxy should then translate to

INVITE urn:service:sos
To: sip:911@example.com;user=phone

and then eventually to:

INVITE urn:service:sos
To: sip:911@example.com;user=phone
Route: sip:psap@some-psap.gov;lr

This way, once the 911 is recognized as a local representation of an 
emergency call it is replaced with a global representation of an 
emergency call and remains unchanged from then on. The Route headers 
then get it there.

Is this the same question as "Should the To: change on a retargeting  
operation"?

Or is it "Is 911 service determination  a retargeting operation or is  
it a routing operation"?

That's where my discomfort arises. I checked RFC 3261 and To is proxy 
'r', i.e., this is not an option.

Parties in the call path should be able to tell that this was an 
emergency call. It does appear to be a (logical) destination identifier.

The original motivation was to make sure that calls marked as emergency 
might bypass authorization, but you want to make sure that you can't do

INVITE urn:service:sos
Route: sip:alice@yahoo.com;lr

where Alice is a friend not providing (officially recognized) emergency 
services. I don't think this is possible, so the only entities that can 
make such authorization bypass decisions would be the one inserting the 
Route (which is probably what you would do in any event).

Works for me. Is there any estimate how existing proxies would deal with 
a service URN + Route combination?

Perhaps you could say something like this:

"The presence of Supported: gruu suggests a high likelihood that the
Contact is a GRUU, and so a UA using that Contact SHOULD proceed on the
assumption that it is a GRUU, until it has positive information that it
is not.  In particular, the UA should not utilize any mechanisms to work
around that the Contact is not a GRUU until it has determined that
utilizing it as a GRUU does not work."

That language:

1) makes all current networks conforming, regardless of "proprietary
hacks", because no element sends  Supported: gruu yet.

2) when "Supported: gruu" is present, bans proprietary hacks except as a
fall-back mechanism.

which seems to me to be a good combination.

I was thinking that the discussion of what "Supported: gruu" means about
the Contact in a message is not as significant as it seems.  In most
cases, if a UA wants to contact its counterpart UA, it does so by
sending an in-dialog request (which *must* work), rather than sending an
out-of-dialog request to the Contact URI.

In my experience, the way that a Contact URI is used is by being
revealed in a dialog event package, and the subscriber to the dialog
event package uses that URI to execute a call-control operation.

But by the time that the subscriber sees the Contact URI, any
information that was present in the original message is entirely lost,
except for what is in the URI itself.

While working on slides on GRUU for tomorrows meeting, I ran into a 
pretty major issue with the mechanism in the GRUU spec where the proxy 
removes its record-route from requests or responses. The issue is of a 
more practical nature, but significant.

If implementors follow the guidance of the specification, any mid-dialog 
requests arriving at the home proxy get routed based on the GRUU in the 
request URI. This will cause the request to be delivered to an EP based 
on their registered contact and any Path values that may have been 
there. All of these are URI, and were created as a consequence of 
registration, and are not specific to the dialog. There are two primary 
consequences:

  1. there is no way to guarantee that the mid-dialog request goes to 
the same proxy that saw the initial request

  2. there is no way a proxy can place some information into a 
record-route and get it back out in a mid-dialog request


Any implementations which store any kind of call state, either internal 
to the server or in the record-routes, will simply no longer work. The 
mid-dialog request might go to the wrong place, and even if it goes to 
the right place, any state or state references in the record-route might 
have been lost.

We've had other concerns raised against this part of the GRUU spec, and 
its definitely the weakest part of the document. I think this issue 
pushes it over the edge, and we need to do something different.

I would like to revisit a proposal we discussed during the Paris IETF, 
which was dismissed at the time. However, recent discussions on 
retargeting vs. routing have clarified things in my mind sufficiently 
that I think its the right way to go.

The proposal that was made (by Dale I think), was to have the endpoint 
insert the GRUU in the Contact of the 200 OK, but also have the UAS 
insert a Record-Route for itself. As a consequence of this, the 
mid-dialog requests would show up at the EP, but wouldn't get routed 
back around to the home proxy because there is another route - pointing 
to the UA itself. Thus, the request shows up at the UA in this form:

INVITE sip:gruu
Route: sip:endpoint-ip

this requires an endpoint to get a request with a Route header field and 
process it.

Whats interesting is that this is exactly the same structure we've been 
talking about in the discussion on retargeting vs. routing. There, the 
idea was that for requests outside of a dialog, the request would show 
up at the home proxy, and the registered contact would then be placed 
into the topmost Route header, and the R-URI would be preserved. When it 
arrives at the UAS, the request would look like:

INVITE sip:aor
Route: sip:endpoint-ip

this actually makes a lot of sense; both initial and mid-dialog requests 
are routed via Route header fields eventually arriving at the UAS with a 
Route header that looks identically in each case. Initial requests show 
up with an AOR in the r-uri, and mid-dialog requests, being targeted to 
the instance to which the call is currently active, show up with the GRUU.

There were two reasons discussed at the last IETF IIRC, on why we didn't 
choose this approach. They were:

1. major change in sip architecture
2. mid-dialog requests get "pegged" to a specific UA IP address and port 
for the duration of the dialog, since they now appear in a record-route, 
which cannot be updated mid-dialog

I think the first issue is true, but recent discussions have clarified 
(for me at least) how this would work and I am increasingly comfortable 
with this change.

The second issue is also still true. The question is whether that is 
really important right now. The main applications for it have been 
sip-level session mobility and continuation of dialogs during failures 
of proxies when used with sip-outbound. The latter is something I'd 
really like to have, but I'd prefer to defer specification of an 
approach for this to a later time.  As for the former usage (SIP-level 
session mobility), others need to comment on how important that is (most 
mobility work is done below the SIP layer).

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

In regard to the special edge router behavior described in section
8.4.2, while I was working out some sample call flows, it struck me that
the descriptions of the special edge router behaviors at the end of
8.4.2 would benefit with being spelled out more exactly.  I was thinking
of something like "When the edge router receives a response containing a
Record-Route that it inserted ... and the Request-URI (or first Route)
is ..., then it should remove that Record-Route from the response."

This is a practical problem.  When I was checking to see how this
algorithm interacted with another approach to solve the edge router
problem, I noticed that I could not rigorously determine how 8.4.2 would
behave without (essentially) assuming that it would do the right thing
in unusual cases.

I would be willing to help rewriting these paragraphs.

Dale

In yesterday's SIP session it was agreed to investigate the possibility of
changing the To header field URI in a response to a dialog-forming request.
To kick off this discussion, here are my thoughts.

A modified To header field URI in a response to a dialog-forming request can
indicate that the request has been retargeted. This would not be
authenticated, so if an authenticated called party identity is required it
would be necessary to ignore the modified To header field URI and wait for
an authenticated identity in a subsequent request from the called party.

One use case is in a closed environment, particularly where sips is used,
where transitive trust is used to give credibility to the unauthenticated
identity.

A second use case is to give a preliminary indication based on an identity
in a provisional response, to be replaced by an indication based on an
authenticated identity in the subsequent 2xx response.

Fire away.

John

At yesterday's SIP session we had rough consensus on changing the From
header field URI in mid-dialog requests. We also said that no special
provision would be made to accommodate proxies that cannot cope with this.
Nothing was said about UASs that cannot cope with this. Do we need an option
tag to indicate support for a changed From header field URI during a dialog?
With such an option tag, a UA that does not receive a Supported header field
with this option tag during the dialog-forming transaction would refrain
from changing the From header field URI in mid-dialog requests.

1. Contact URIs should always have been globally routable
2. With GRUU there exists a mechanism to get a contact that fulfills 1.
3. From now on all clients that does what the spec says (1.) must
include Supported: gruu... !!? Otherwise servers that do not follow the
spec break things... but is that not a general rule of broken things?=20

Should we also add "Supported: transaction-id" that states that the
transaction id is really unique over space and time, to let the other
side understand that we did not just copy-paste the z9hG4bK into the
branch id without understanding its purpose? Should "Supported:
valid-sip" be added to indicate that we have added all mandatory headers
like to, from, and so on?

My conclusion:
Servers that were broken before and applied hack solutions will not
understand "Supported: gruu" and will continue to apply the hack
solution. Servers that follow the spec and first try the contact as if
it were a GRUU will work regardless of the presence of "Supported:
gruu". Therefore I think the "Supported: gruu" should not be used (apart
from REGISTER).

Instead of specifying that the UAS adds a Record-Route header to its 
response, what about making the UAC add a Route header containing the remote 
target (Contact) it learned from the dialog-creating response, in all 
mid-dialog requests. This gives the same resulting message and takes care of 
(2), since any endpoint can update its Contact when its IP address or port 
changes.

Essentially this would make the UAC act just like a proxy would when it 
resolves an AoR to a Contact.

A next logical step would be to have the UAC insert the URI it used for the 
initial request (i.e. typically an AoR) also in mid-dialog requests as 
request-URI, instead of the remote target (Contact). Changes to the request 
URI are then reserved for retargeting cases, which mid-dialog requests are 
not. They then become requests that are routed to a specific Contact (GRUU).

In other words, all requests (both in and outside dialogs) would arrive at 
the UAS as:

INVITE sip:aor
Route: gruu (with grid)

Jeroen van Bemmel

Subject: [Sip] Changing the From header



At yesterday's SIP session we had rough consensus on changing the From
header field URI in mid-dialog requests. We also said that no special
provision would be made to accommodate proxies that cannot cope with

I think it is best that the UAS add the record-route. The general principle
of adding things like record-route and path is that the entity desiring to
be in the path inserts itself.

Besides, if there is a B2BUA in the middle, such as a privacy service as
defined in RFC 3323, the full route-set on the UAS side of the B2BUA does
not reach the UAC.

(GRUU).

I think this would still cause the mid-dialog request to spiral thru the
edge proxy.

The consequences of not using an option tag would be that a 2543 UAS might
reject the in-dialog request with a 481. The UAC could then change back to
the original From and re-try, but if any proxies along the path are keeping
any kind of dialog/call state, they might remove that state when they saw
the 481 pass by.

John,

Wouldn't you need to have every UA and proxy involved with the call to
signal that it supports changing From, e.g. in the Record-Route, e.g. a
3261 tag?  If any one does not support it then making a mid-dialog
change will break at the point that one doesn't recognize the dialog.
=20
The converse might be to have a option-tag: 2543 if any node recognizes
that another node will not support the above.

			At yesterday's SIP session we had rough
consensus on changing the From header field URI in mid-dialog requests.
We also said that no special provision would be made to accommodate
proxies that cannot cope with this. Nothing was said about UASs that
cannot cope with this. Do we need an option tag to indicate support for
a changed From header field URI during a dialog? With such an option
tag, a UA that does not receive a Supported header field with this
option tag during the dialog-forming transaction would refrain from
changing the From header field URI in mid-dialog requests.

Could you clarify what you mean by wait for an authenticated identity.
Is that an Auth-ID body or is it the implication that an endpoint
corrected the To: header or provided an additional P-header?

	In yesterday's SIP session it was agreed to investigate the
possibility of changing the To header field URI in a response to a
dialog-forming request. To kick off this discussion, here are my
thoughts.

	A modified To header field URI in a response to a dialog-forming
request can indicate that the request has been retargeted. This would
not be authenticated, so if an authenticated called party identity is
required it would be necessary to ignore the modified To header field
URI and wait for an authenticated identity in a subsequent request from
the called party.

	One use case is in a closed environment, particularly where sips
is used, where transitive trust is used to give credibility to the
unauthenticated identity.

	A second use case is to give a preliminary indication based on
an identity in a provisional response, to be replaced by an indication
based on an authenticated identity in the subsequent 2xx response.

Michael,
 
What I mean is a request in the reverse direction (e.g., UPDATE) carrying
the Identity header, which authenticates the From header.

Subject: [Sip] Changing the To header



In yesterday's SIP session it was agreed to investigate the possibility of
changing the To header field URI in a response to a dialog-forming request.
To kick off this discussion, here are my thoughts.

A modified To header field URI in a response to a dialog-forming request can
indicate that the request has been retargeted. This would not be
authenticated, so if an authenticated called party identity is required it
would be necessary to ignore the modified To header field URI and wait for
an authenticated identity in a subsequent request from the called party.

One use case is in a closed environment, particularly where sips is used,
where transitive trust is used to give credibility to the unauthenticated
identity.

A second use case is to give a preliminary indication based on an identity
in a provisional response, to be replaced by an indication based on an
authenticated identity in the subsequent 2xx response.

Fire away. 

John

Michael,
 
The consensus in SIP on Tuesday was that we should not take any special
action to deal with proxies that fail to comply with RFC3261. Therefore my
question concerns only UAs.

John,
 
Wouldn't you need to have every UA and proxy involved with the call to
signal that it supports changing From, e.g. in the Record-Route, e.g. a 3261
tag?  If any one does not support it then making a mid-dialog change will
break at the point that one doesn't recognize the dialog.
 
The converse might be to have a option-tag: 2543 if any node recognizes that
another node will not support the above.

Seems to me this is unecessary (provided we don't require RFC 2543 backward
compatibility).

At yesterday's SIP session we had rough consensus on changing the From
header field URI in mid-dialog requests. We also said that no special
provision would be made to accommodate proxies that cannot cope with this.
Nothing was said about UASs that cannot cope with this. Do we need an option
tag to indicate support for a changed From header field URI during a dialog?
With such an option tag, a UA that does not receive a Supported header field
with this option tag during the dialog-forming transaction would refrain
from changing the From header field URI in mid-dialog requests.

I still think a Supported is a good idea. At the very least, if its not 
supported, a UA on the other side can know its not worth its trouble to 
try an UPDATE with a new From. There is no harm to the Supported tag, 
and it might help.

I think there are practical difficulties with this.

In a real deployment you would like the common case to be that things 
work on the first try. If you usually have to try twice then you 
effectively double the amount of signaling your network must support, 
and increase the latency as well.

Following your suggestion, if you deploy a "modern" (gruuful) proxy with 
only gruuless UAs, you would have double the traffic you would have if 
you had the proxy recognize "Supported:gruu".

But wouldn't it be better to let the broken things advertise that they
do not follow the specification completely. Let the UAs that do not
insert contact that is globally routable add a "Supported:
not-gruu-contact" if they do not want to have the penalty of the proxy
trying twice. I think we should optimize the performance for those who
do things right according to the spec, instead of having everybody
adding more kludges to their messages. Of course we should also have a
backwards compatible solution, but I think it is very important to have
the additional cost paid by members with the broken implementations,
"Supported: not-gruu-contact" would be my simple suggestion.

jonathan,

i was hoping that gruu together with for example replaces header could
be used to implement session level mobility between different network
technologies.  i would be VERY disappointed if that would no longer be
the case.

are you saying it is OK that IETF has no solution for sip session level
mobility and those who need it should use UMA or some other 3gpp
technology instead?

So, you think the solution I presented is not enough?=20

The implementations that know they are broken can say so to speed up
handling (optional to follow by server). The rest of the broken
implementations will get a penalty when the server first tries to do the
right thing before finally trying any dirty hacks.

I bet someone is going to say something like: "But what if I know that
all my UAs are "broken". Then the server can do the hacks first to speed
things up". My answer to that is that our goal is to standardize and
optimize the correct way of doing things. People can do whatever crazy
things they like and implement other solutions, but it won't be standard
SIP. In this case I even presented a back-up solution that will work
even for those who haven't done everything right. What more could they
ask for?=20

Instead, tell me why everybody, from now on, and forever, should pay the
prize because some implementations choose to take a short-cut.
(SIP is already full of those kludges, lets not make another one if we
can avoid it!)

The IETF 64 SIP agenda mentioned that the reuse draft was to be discussed.
I wish that I could have attended.  And I am anxiously awaiting the
preliminary minutes and slides. :)

If the discussion included resolutions for the linked questions, would
someone please post (or send me) the answers to the questions.

Thanks in advance,
Brett

Could you explain the cost/benefit of some vendor to upgrade their
client just to say they don't support each new feature?

That doesn't mean that the system can not progress, just that it needs
to determine if it is breaking a previous feature where backward
compatibility is worthwhile, or whether the previous feature was broken
to begin with and will remain broken until certain elements get with the
program.

Rough notes are already posted on the softarmor site.

Connection reuse got deprecated from the agenda due to a flair-up of  
the higher-priority GRUU.

Rohan recapped the status as follows:

===
 From Scott's rough notes,

Rohan Mahy - Connection Reuse

       Rohan has received a number of mutually conflicting suggestions
       on how to address problems.  Since a quorum of those making the
       suggestions are not available here now, it will be taken to the
       list.

       Cullen Jennings - what is the timetable to resolve them?

       RM - will do work with the goal of completing it before the next
       IETF.
===

I also had several people ask if we still really need this draft.

Do we?

SIP working group meeting slides and notes (one set of slides missing  
at this moment) have been posted to the supplementary site at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf64/index.html

The slides are also on the IETF proceedings page, to which there is a  
link on the softarmor site.

I'll get the one remaining set of slides posted when I get them. I'll  
also try and draft up some minutes and get them out fairly soon.

As I said, people can do whatever they like, and if you do not like to
upgrade your clients and servers, fine. The SIP WG is here to create and
promote a working standard, from now on, and forever. My point was to
optimize the behavior of the protocol for the ones that have, and for
those who will, implement it in a correct way. I also presented the
back-up plan of how broken implementations will work together with
correct implementations. Your question seems to be "The vendor has a
working system, with broken clients and broken servers, how should I
explain why they should upgrade?)". My answer, don't fix it, if the
system is working for the moment, but don't try to optimize the SIP
standard for that scenario.

This is not a discussion of some additional special feature, it is part
of the core specification. As have been said before, the contact header
should always have been globally routable. Otherwise we could end up
with extension tags for everything that is actually in RFC-3261, just
like I described in my first mail. Are you actually thinking that is a
good idea?

Hi Brett,

We didn't discuss connection reuse.  Looking over the comments I 
received, we would need you and Jeroen to have a reasonable discussion, 
so I yielded the time so we could discuss GRUU.  I'd like to schedule 
some time on the phone to talk about the connect reuse draft and how to 
fix it.

thanks,
-rohan

with a possible extension:

1) What if you allow alias if the request contains a challenge response that
the server / proxy can verify to come from an authorised user?
2) Same with S/MIME bodies?

2 - about ephemereal ports in Via headers

You keep trying to extrapolate from a very simple comment to some other
undesirable design.  If that leads to uneasiness on your part then don't
do it.  I meant only to say that it is not worthwhile to waste time
inventing a protocol element that would likely never get used. =20

Nothing more.

Conference me in on the phone call as well.

Hi Otmar.

First of all I believe the correct place is in SIP and not SIPPING. 

As for the comments...

I tried to stay away from floating point values for performance reasons. 

My question is, why would you need to insert a value BETWEEN other values?
Why not just add a new higher value? Are you referring to cases where the
new value is a subset of another value?. Can you think of an example? 

As for proposal to use 40,50, etc., I usually try to stay away from
solutions that make things "a little better". If indeed there is a need for
values between existing values than using 40,50, etc. is not a real solution
since it only makes things a little better. 

As for your comment on the complexity of the example I agree. I was focusing
more on which attributes to use and less on the actual syntax. I took this
example from many others such examples on the web. If I did do this, though,
the xmlns would have to be the Trusted Anchor and not the originating MI as
these newly defined attributes need to be agreed on by all participants of
the federation and not just the two MI's in question. 

I hope to release an updated version with this and a few other changes
shortly so if you have any other input feel free to respond.

Thanks,

David

Subject: Comment on draft-schwartz-sipping-spit-saml-00


Hello,

as I'm not sure whether this draft is supposed to be discussed in sip or
sipping, I'm writing directly to you:

After a quick reading of draft-schwartz-sipping-spit-saml-00 I'm
wondering:

* e.g. 5.1.1: 
	The numerical values maybe fine to denote the strength levels
	you have in mind now, but they do not offer any space for
	adding new notions which lie between current values.

	I'd recommend you change the values from 0,1,2,3,4 to
	0,10,20,30,40 to accomodate future enhancements.

* The XML (SAML) framents look overly complex:
	I haven't read the SAML spec itself, but the example

	<Attribute
		AttributeName="IdentityStrength"
		AttributeNamespace="http://mio.com">
		<AttributeValue>2
		</AttributeValue>
	</Attribute>

	looks overly contorted. Why not the following?

	<IdentityStrength xmlns="http://mio.com">2</IdentityStrength>

cheers,

/ol

Within early versions of draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis, the Supported header
could be expected within 1xx responses.  However within
draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-06 it was removed and remains so within RFC 3261.
Is there a reason why it is undesirable to indicate supported extensions
within a 1xx?  Or was it just an oversight when changing the "Summary of
header fields" table to indicate 2xx instead of all responses?

My current understanding/assumption is that the sender would loadbalance
across the opened connections for the alias.  Thus each cluster member =
could
establish a connection and keep it open to remain one of the choices for =
the
alias.  However it is definitely a problem when SRV would have indicated
different priority levels (or weights).

I think that this problem (and many of the questions I posted in prior
emails) arise from section 3 requirement 2.  Is requirement 2 really a
mandatory requirement for the reuse draft?

If not, requirement 2 potentially could be removed and placed into a
separate draft.  The draft could provide a more complete solution =
concerning
how to overlay the benefits of SRV priority and weights with the desired
number of connections between 2 devices, between a device and cluster, =
and
between 2 clusters.  It potentially could also define a mechanism to =
know
when to skip even trying to open a new connection towards a particular
device or cluster.

Over time, this will cause an aliased connection to be established
across all servers in a cluster.  The disadvantage is that this
forces the sender talking to the cluster to keep multiple
connections open, thereby defeating the purpose having a single
connection.

However, this is one way to solve it.  If we agree, then we
ought to mention this in the draft.

Yes, different priority levels are a problem anyway ... but I
think that the problem even occurs across the same priority
level as I indicated.  The solution for different priority/
weights would essentially be the same, namely open multiple
connections.

Hmmm ... interesting.  Maybe something to discuss during the
phone call.

Rohan, Brett, Jeroene: I can get a bridge if that will help.
We can have a private email exchange to work out the time and
other logistics.

1) There are two SIP UA's A and B.
2) A sends INVITE with SDP to B.
3) B responds with 100 and then 180 Ringing(wthout SDP)  and adds TO tag to
180.
3) After 180 is received, A sends a  RE-INVITE before 200 OK is received
(i.e RE-INVITE with all the headers having same value as initial INVITE and
higher CSEQ value).
4) In this case B responds with a  '491 Request Pending' for RE-INVITE.

Is it the right behaviour, if not then what should be the right behaviour of
B?

After receiving 180, Invite Client Transaction at User A is in =
'Proceeding' state. Re-Invite must not be sent before the previous =
INVITE trasaction gets into a Completed or Terminated state. =20

-----------
RFC 3261, 14.1 UAC Behavior States:
UAC MUST NOT initiate a new INVITE transaction within a dialog while =
another INVITE transaction is in progress in either direction. If there =
is an ongoing INVITE client transaction, the TU MUST wait until the =
transaction reaches the completed or terminated state before initiating =
the new INVITE.
------------

Also 491 'Request Pending' is sent when a UAS receives an INVITE while =
it is expecting a response for the INVITE it has sent.

500 Server Internal Error with 'Retry-After' is appropriate for this =
case. See RFC 3261 section 14.2.

No, this is not correct behavior. There must not be a reinvite until the 
initial invite transaction is completed (with a 200 and an ACK).

If the 180 is sent *reliably* (using the 100rel option) and then 
PRACKed, then there is an early dialog and A may send an UPDATE. That is 
as close as you can get to the functionality of a reinvite before the 
initial invite is present.

Hi All,
I would like to know if it is correct to send a 3xx response for a
re-Invite request. And if so, what could be the possible scenarios.
Also refer the following link which says 3xx to re_INVITE allowed.( IETF
meeting 52 ):
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf52/slides/pres-jdrosen-sip-new-bis-ietf52.ppt

Thanks,
Shweta.

Paul, but in our case an early dialog is already formed when we received a
'180' with TO tag, so in this case a INVITE can be considered as a RE-INVITE
as is the case
below, then a '491' becomes a valid response.


Acc to RFC 3261 :- 12.1 Creation of a Dialog

   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses
   to requests with specific methods.  Within this specification, only
   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag, where the request was
   INVITE, will establish a dialog.  A dialog established by a non-final
   response to a request is in the "early" state and it is called an
   early dialog.

Manjeet-

A) Re-Invite must not be sent before the previous Invite transaction
completes.

B) A new offer must not be sent before a offer/answer exchange
completes. In the case you mentioned, 180 is received without SDP. From
the message flow, I think it is not a reliable provisional also. As
offer/answer is not completed, you cannot send another offer(even UPDATE
is not possible). You may want to look at "Table 1. Summary of SIP Usage
of Offer/Answer Model" in 'draft-sawada-sipping-sip-offeranswer-00'. A
new offer is possible in early dialog only with PRACK and UPDATE
requests.

C) If UAS receives a re-Invite(from an errant UAC) before UAS sends a
final response to previous Invite, it should respond back with 500
(Server Internal Error) and include 'Retry-After' header with a value
between 0 to 10 seconds. 491 is not the correct message.

Subject: RE: [Sip] Query about '491 response' in case of RE-INVITE.

Paul, but in our case an early dialog is already formed when we received
a '180' with TO tag, so in this case a INVITE can be considered as a
RE-INVITE as is the case below, then a '491' becomes a valid response.


Acc to RFC 3261 :- 12.1 Creation of a Dialog

   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses
   to requests with specific methods.  Within this specification, only
   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag, where the request was
   INVITE, will establish a dialog.  A dialog established by a non-final
   response to a request is in the "early" state and it is called an
   early dialog.

No, this is not correct behavior. There must not be a reinvite until the
initial invite transaction is completed (with a 200 and an ACK).

If the 180 is sent *reliably* (using the 100rel option) and then
PRACKed, then there is an early dialog and A may send an UPDATE. That is
as close as you can get to the functionality of a reinvite before the
initial invite is present.

hi otmar,=20

>=20
that's a very good question.=20

let me point to a few aspects here:=20

- first, i think that there is a difference in the way how difficult it
is to obtain an identity in a certain domain. i guess there are no
doubts about this.=20

- the second aspect is how you actually rank the different ways. i am
not sure whether it is a good idea to make a ranking at all. maybe it is
just better to assume that there are different categories and to let the
person that writes the policies decide whether they think that certain
mechanisms are more difficult in, for example, one country than in
another one.=20

- the third aspect is extensibility. how do you actually add new
mechanisms to the list? currently we do not define an extensibility
mechanism and that needs to be fixed.=20

for example, what happens if i want to add something like a
'return-routability' check. this is often done with today's email
providers. you need to have a valid email address (or something
similar). you might also use an sms (which provides higher security ,
probably).=20

- the forth aspect is: 'are the currently defined values reasonable?'
for example, is the 'paying service' actually indicating something about
your identity. at some point in time we need to go through these
attributes and discuss what attributes & values are most useful.

>=20
> 	looks overly contorted. Why not the following?
>=20
> 	<IdentityStrength xmlns=3D"http://mio.com">2</IdentityStrength>

i will look at this aspect in the next few days. let me send you a
response about it later. the usage of the attribute statement seems to
be the right way forward but i am not sure about the details at the
moment. we, however, might not be able to put arbitrary xml statements
in a saml assertion.=20

Manjeet,

Sorry that my prior reply missed the point of what you were asking. Once 
we havemade the assumption that A has violated 3261, we are in an area 
of speculation. In general 3261 doesn't specify the proper response to 
invalid usage. I think your use of 491 might be ok. Lots of other things 
might also be plausible.

paul,

just last question, can we send '180 Ringing' as a response in this case for
the 2nd INVITE, and would 180 be a valid response in this case.?

We are having a big discussion over this?

The entire call flow is invalid from the time that A sent the reinvite, 
because a reinvite is not allowed in that state. So it is impossible to 
say what response to it is "valid". All you can do is conjecture what 
kind of response will have the most satisfactory result. But you are 
guessing about how a broken UA (A) will respond, and there is no general 
way to know that.

You can send any final error response to the reinvite, and then send an 
error response to the initial invite as well to indicate your 
displeasure. Or you can just reject the reinvite and hope for the best.

I can't find any error responses that are really appropriate for this 
situation. The 491 you suggest seems at least as good as any other for 
the reinvite. If you then want to reject the original invite as well 
because of concern that the caller is broken, there is again no 
obviously appropriate status to use. I think I might use 487 in that case.

I'd like to apologize to the community for any confusion that may  
have resulted from an operational problem.
	
Recently I thought I'd been having lots of conversations with  
Francois and Mary and others from Nortel, as well as lots of folks  
from other shops, about reason and History-Info and whatnot.

But it seems that Nortel.com started filtering all email from my  
server to Nortel around October 19. I presume the Nortel folks have  
been getting most of what I had to say via the mailing list, but I  
suspect some stuff got lost in the mixup.

I would ordinarily have noticed this sooner, but had implemented a  
filter to divert "mailer errors" to a folder due to the huge flood of  
"hello.exe" bounce spam related to sobig and other worms. And I got  
lazy about looking in that folder. Today I looked, and was horrified  
to see dozens of bounce messages from Nortel.

So if the conversation about Reason, and History, and Voicemail URI  
has seemed particularly confusing to some of you, it may well be  
because of this error, and I apologize.

I'm also kind of ticked at the mail admins at Nortel, I might add.  
But these things do happen from time to time. I just found my spam  
filter was blocking mail from Henry, so I guess I shouldn't throw too  
many stones.

I don't know if it's officially allowed by RFC 3261, but 3xx responses
to in-dialog requests have been mentioned on the mailing lists several
times, and nobody has come up with a sensible meaning to assign to them.
Once a route-set is established, all one can change in the flow of
messages is the contacts on each end, and re-INVITE is defined as the
means to do that.

So at present, I'd say that 3xx for a re-INVITE is not allowed.

Dale

Can a proxy add Supported? Is this disallowed?
If proxy may do so, the Supported cannot be interpreted as UAS
capabilities, even if the 1xx is reliable (consider INVITE with
Require:100rel).

Hi,

As per the outbound-01 draft, the pin-route option tag can be used by UAs
that do not have a GRUU,
in SUBSCRIBE request sent to configuration framework. Can the same tag also
be used
in SUBSCRIBE request sent to event framework (event- Presence) ?

If a proxy genreates the 1xx itself, it is effectively acting as a UAS, 
in which case insertion of Supported is fine. This won't confuse a UAC 
since any 1xx generated by the proxy itself will have different tags 
from a 2xx or other responses generated by the actual UA, and thus 
represent a different (early) dialog.

A proxy cannot insert or modify a Supported header in a response that 
passes by it (i.e., one for which it is proxying).

I think it is wrong to send the 491 in this case. 491 response can only be
sent by A to B, in your example, if B sends an INVITE to A. A can send
multiple Invites as these are nothing but updates to the original. If you
look at the ISUP-SIP overlap signaling ( RFC 3578) you will see this
scenario described when SAM messages are sent.

Cheers
Ramesh

Ramesh,

Be very carerful with the overlap signaling.  In fact, the subsequent
INVITEs that A sends are each new dialogs, with each old previous dialog
being later rejected.  They are not updates to the same dialog.

	I think it is wrong to send the 491 in this case. 491 response
can only be sent by A to B, in your example, if B sends an INVITE to A.
A can send multiple Invites as these are nothing but updates to the
original. If you look at the ISUP-SIP overlap signaling ( RFC 3578)  you
will see this scenario described when SAM messages are sent.

I think that using re-invite for the sessions that are
not completed (i.e. 200 ok not received) do not make
sense , instead usage of UPDATE more appropriate ...

There are issues with update. You will really not know if "UPDATE" is
supported until response other than trying is made. So the only method that
you can use is INVITE. Here in this perticular interop scenario the initial
invite did not have the complete routable information so the subsequent
invites will update the number.
As Mr. Hammer pointed out the invites that were send need to be acked. I
don't know with what error messag they will be acked.

Is this different for 'Require', because in the case of session timers
proxy can add a 'Require' to request/response depending on UAC/UAS not
supporting session timers.=20

Subject: Re: [Sip] RFC 3261 supported header in 1xx responses

If a proxy genreates the 1xx itself, it is effectively acting as a UAS,
in which case insertion of Supported is fine. This won't confuse a UAC
since any 1xx generated by the proxy itself will have different tags
from a 2xx or other responses generated by the actual UA, and thus
represent a different (early) dialog.

A proxy cannot insert or modify a Supported header in a response that
passes by it (i.e., one for which it is proxying).

Hi,

 

I have a question on the GRUU draft when it comes to Record Routing. 

I am not sure if the desired result, as depicted in the draft can be achieved with the current description.

The draft talks about the edge proxy removing itself from the RR of responses both at the originating domain and terminating domain with the desired result being as quoted from the spec:

 

"
Removing its Record-Route value from the response will result in the
   route set being seen differently by the caller and callee; the callee
   (which is the user agent in the figure) will have a route set entry
   for its edge proxy, while the caller will not.  The caller will have
   a route set entry for its edge proxy, while the callee will not."

 

Lets take an example to see where the problem is as far as the 

description in the draft is concerned So lets take the following case:

 

 UE1--- HP1------EP1..........................HP2------EP2---------UE2

 

 Both UE1, and UE2 acquired GRUUs, and both EP1 & EP2 are in the path 

 for their subsequent UEs when they REGISTER.

 

If UE1 initiates an INVITE and all proxies insert themselves in 

the RR, so we have the RR arriving at UE2 having EP2, HP1, EP1, HP1.

  

Then according to the draft both EP2, and EP1 should remove themselves

from the response to the INVITE.

So, if UE2 returns a 200 OK with the RR, EP2 removes itself, and EP1 removes itself as well.

So UE1 sees a RR including HP1,HP2, and that the route set it has

While UE2 have a route set entry that includes all 4 proxies, EP2, HP1, EP1, HP1.

 

Am I misinterpreting the spec?

Hi:

I lost track of the discussion on problems with the non-INVITE =
transaction.
The latest draft version I could find has now expired. Can someone =
please
point me to a email archive, meeting minutes, etc that describes the
final outcome or prescription? (I am particularly interested in the =
current
recommendation on sending provisional responses for the non-INVITE=20
transaction.)

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
Shaun Bharrat

What should be the response to close the Invite transaction in case of the
subsequent INVITE, would it be 484 address incomplete. It cannot be 200ok.

I believe it should return a GRUU for the contact that has an instance 
parameter, and not for the other one.

	What should be the response to close the Invite transaction in

			I think it is wrong to send the 491 in this
case. 491 response can only be sent by A to B, in your example, if B
sends an INVITE to A. A can send multiple Invites as these are nothing
but updates to the original. If you look at the ISUP-SIP overlap
signaling ( RFC 3578)  you will see this scenario described when SAM
messages are sent.

				1) There are two SIP UA's A and B.

The rules for handling these situations are in section 14 of RFC 3261.

The first issue is whether an INVITE is a re-INVITE, that is, whether it
is within an existing dialog.  Section 14.2 paragraph 1 refers to
section 13.3.1 for how to make this distinction.  Basically, if it
contains a to-tag, it is in-dialog, and if it does not, it is out-of-
dialog.  If an INVITE is out-of-dialog, it does not interact with any
previous INVITE (other than that a UA may reject it as erroneous, since
it has the same Call-Id as a previous dialog).

Within a dialog, a re-INVITE cannot be processed while another INVITE is
being processed.  If the INVITE being processed was sent by the sender
of the new INVITE, the server should reject the latter with 500 (section
14.2 paragraph 2).  If the INVITE being processed was sent by the other
UA, the recipient of the new INVITE must reject it with 491 (section
14.2, paragraph 3).

Hi folks,

=20

A call is initiated bye a SIP INVITE message, then 10 minutes after, =
peer A
send a message UPDATE ( I don=92t know why) to which the remote peer B =
doesn=92t
send anything but ICMP message =93 destination unreachable (port =
unreachable)=94

A few message UDATE later without response and a few seconds more later, =
the
remote peer sends a BYE message to close the communication.

=20

Do you think that this is the flow of UDATE that make the remote peer =
close
the com ?

=20

Why does the peer A send the message UPDATE after 1O minutes time =85

=20

Do you think about a bad configuration of one peer ?

=20

Thanks for your replies,

=20

Using the IETF draft tracker at:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi


I see that:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-problems-02.txt

and

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions-03.txt

have been approved by the IESG and are in the RFC Editor's queue,

Once a draft has entered this state, it doesn't "expire" even if it  
persists past the date on the draft. This is important, since drafts  
normally expire after six months, and the queue is longer than that.

George,

I just recently noticed this as well. I don't think you are 
misinterpretting the draft, I think the draft is in error.

The problem is that on the terminating side, to get the intended result, 
EP2 needs to leave itself out of the R-R in the request, but add itself 
in to the R-R in the response. For that to work when there are more 
complex topologies beyond it, when it forwards the request it needs to 
remember where the top of the R-R stack is, so that it will know *where* 
in the R-R to place itself when the response arrives.

Thanks Paul, 
The desired result to avoid spiralling is that UE2 should have the following route set to be derived from the incoming request: EP2, HP2, HP1.
UE1 should have the following route set derived from the response: EP1, HP1, HP2.

I made a mistake in the drawing, HP1 & EP1 should be reversed, so it should like to that.

UE1--- EP1------HP1..........................HP2------EP2---------UE2

Yes, its different from Require. Require is not an indication of 
capabilities of a UA - its an indication that a particular extension 
needs to be applied.

I have an issue regarding RFC 3265 section 3.3.6 "Polling Resource
State".  It is clear that a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires value of 0
may constitute a resource query or an unsubscribe, depending upon
whether a dialog exists.  If I have a proxy server wants to distinguish
between unsubscribe and resource query, and my proxy server does not
maintain dialog state, what message element(s) can it use to make that
determination?

=20

My position is that you can use the To tag parameter (or lack of).  On
reading through 3261, 12.1.2 states that To tags should not be expected
as they were not mandated in 2543 (there seems to be a lot of this
lately).  However, 2543 states in section 6.37-
=20
  "It MUST be placed in the To field of the response by each instance
when there is a possibility that the request was forked at an
intermediate proxy."

=20

That RFC is silent on when it is ok to omit.  My read of this is that a
UAS can only "know" that a forking server was NOT in the path in one
condition- if the request was sent peer to peer, without any proxy
servers in the path.=20

=20

Accepting that, and knowing that my question is unique to scenarios when
proxies are involved, is it ok to assume that any SUBSCRIBE request sent
by a UA (either 3261 or 2543 compliant) which passes through a proxy
meets the following conditions-

-          if a tag parameter is present in the To header, then the
SUBSCRIBE (Expires=3D0) is in fact an unsubscribe.

-          If a tag parameter is NOT present, the SUBSCRIBE =
(Expires=3D0)
is a polling subscribe?

=20

Thanks,

Tim Rang

A new Request for Comments is now available in online RFC libraries.


        RFC 4244

        Title:      An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
                    (SIP) for Request History Information
        Author(s):  M. Barnes, Ed.
        Status:     Standards Track
        Date:       November 2005
        Mailbox:    mary.barnes@nortel.com
        Pages:      44
        Characters: 98992
        Updates/Obsoletes/SeeAlso:    None

        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-history-info-06.txt

        URL:        ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4244.txt


This document defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history
information associated with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
request.  This capability enables many enhanced services by providing
the information as to how and why a call arrives at a specific
application or user.  This document defines a new optional SIP header,
History-Info, for capturing the history information in requests.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG with the message body 
help: ways_to_get_rfcs.  For example:

        To: rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
        Subject: getting rfcs

        help: ways_to_get_rfcs

Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the
author of the RFC in question, or to RFC-Manager@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Unless
specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for
unlimited distribution.

Submissions for Requests for Comments should be sent to
RFC-EDITOR@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Please consult RFC 2223, Instructions to RFC
Authors, for further information.

<h3>Topic: Agenda </h3>
<p>GRUU will be added to the agenda when possible due to new issues
on-list.</p>
<p>Certs dropped from agenda due to no open issues requiring
discussion.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Topic: Charter and Status</h3>
<p>Discussion led by chairs</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Issue: Charter</b>. The only element of the new charter
receiving substantial discussion was the milestone &#8220;Draft
standard versions of SIP and critical supporting<br>
specifications&#8221;.
This was highly controversial as read. The group discussed the
meaning of &#8220;draft standard&#8221; and its requirement for at
least two independent interoperable implementations. The general
consensus seems to be that it is premature to discuss elevating the
standards level of SIP at this time. Two key points were noted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It would be useful to develop a document like the &#8220;TCP Roadmap&#8221;
that explains which RFCs are &#8220;part of SIP&#8221; and are critical to
implementations. Jonathan Rosenberg expressed an interest in this work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Robert Sparks has been tracking the normative requirements
(&#8220;MUSTs&#8221;) of the core specification and will contribute this work to
the process.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Issue: </b><a
 href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cao-sip-response-auth-00.txt"><b>draft-cao-sip-response-auth-00</b></a>.
Few comments received on list. Attendees asked to review.</p>
<p>Issue: Certs draft. This draft is moving from SIPPING to SIP as a
charter deliverable. A poll of the room indicated that at least seven
parties plan to implement the specification. All parties are asked to
review the draft, but Rohan will pick out at least two of the
implementers to assist in a detailed review. </p>
<p><b>TODO:</b> Rohan to coordinate review of Certs draft.</p>
<p><b>Issue: MIB Document.</b> The review of this document has been
delayed by slow responses to MIB doctor requests. The editors report
that there is some controversy over method identifiers, which the MIB
doctors apparently asked to have deleted from the document, then
asked to have added back.</p>
<h3>Topic: Connected Identity</h3>
<p>Discussion led by John Elwell</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Issue: Basic mechanism</b>. Several approaches proposed.
Discussion rapidly converged on modification of &#8220;From:&#8221;
header fields to reflect identity as used in the Identity draft.
Tieing this change to the Outbound draft seems to provide for most
aspects of backward compatibility, but several participants argued
strongly that we should go ahead and &#8220;really fix&#8221; the
&#8220;From: header without cruft to support backward compatibility. The
changing of From: in mid-dialog requests also seemed to have a
general consensus, but didn't appear to be generally understood. The
discussion concluded with a strong consensus on this general line of
work, but a general feeling tht there are probably some lurking
issues that won't become clear until the approach is specified in a
draft.</p>
<h3>Topic: SAML</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Hannes Tschofenig</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p>There seems to be a strong general interest in the approach, but
the working group seemed to agree that we need a draft with more
discussion of practical mechanism and examples in order to really get
started here. There was no consensus to adopt the draft at this time
as baseline text toward the charter deliverable, but the author was
encouraged to proceed with the work and continue the discussion with
the working group in hopes of reaching critical mass.</p>
<h3>Topic: Answer and Alert Modes</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Dean Willis and Andrew Allen</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p>Discussion centered on possible security issues relating to the
combination of auto-answer and null alert modes providing a &#8220;bug
my phone&#8221; or &#8220;baby monitor&#8221; attack. The group
reached consensus on revising the draft to eliminate the alert-mode
functionality, with a general agreement that the use of Alert-Info
with URN behaviors as proposed in SIPPING is a more attractive
approach. The revised draft shall also include stronger guidance on
the &#8220;bug my phone&#8221; aspect. Robert Sparks noted that
several aspects of the draft would be likely to be misunderstood by
implementers and might result in &#8220;train wreck&#8221;
implementations, and agreed to send text to the editor to correct
these flaws. The group did agree that completing this work for OMA is
critical and consistent with the new charter of the working group. </p>
<p><b>TODO:</b> Chairs to coordinate new milestone with AD.</p>
<h3>Topic: Trust Path Discovery</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Kumiko Ono</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Issue:</b> Scaling and &#8220;push&#8221; vs &#8220;pull&#8221;
model. Noted that push model requires advance calculation of several
degrees of connectivity, which can become very large very quickly. It
was reported that AOL cannot three degrees of connectivity for the
AIM database as the problem space becomes too large. </p>
<p>Noted that the IAB messaging workshop recommended investigation of
a distributed reputation system.</p>
<p>Noted that there is a problem relationship to DKIM, so there could
be a similarity in the solution.</p>
<p>Suggested that this material is worth holding a BOF on and perhaps
chartering a working group.</p>
<p>The chairs requested the author to keep the working group informed
of progress in this area, but the general consensus is that this
problem is outside the scope of SIP.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Topic: SAML for SPIT</h3>
<p>Discussion led by David Schwartz</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p>Discussion indicated a general interest in the problem and
approach if it can be shown to scale to practical problem sets.</p>
<p>It was noted that the current draft is domain-oriented, but that
it could be extended to end-user devices if those devices supported
SAML.</p>
<p>The author was also encouraged to further explore the idea of
federated domains.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Topic: Remote Call Control</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Rohan Mahy</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings.</p>
<p>Question: Would full arbitration of end-point (not just dialog)
state be in scope for this draft? The authors don't feel it to be in
scope at this time.</p>
<p>Noted that revisions should explain how this interacts with REFER.</p>
<p>Noted that this is approaching &#8220;full CTI (computer telephony
integration)&#8221;, which has previously been out of scope in SIP.
The room was asked to show hands if they thought this discussion to
be in/out of the interest of SIP. About 20 responded positively, with
about 2 opposed.</p>
<p>The meeting session concluded on-schedule.</p>

<h3>Topic: Agenda</h3>
<p>James Polk suggested that there is no need to discuss location
conveyance. We agreed to have a minimal discussion.</p>
<p>GRUU added to agenda.</p>
<p>Outbound and Refer Feature Parameters reordered due to slide
availability issues.</p>
<p>If time permits, we will discuss Dale Worley's draft on dialog
event package implementation guidelines,
<a
 href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-worley-sipping-dialog-00.txt">draft-worley-sipping-dialog-00.txt</a></p>
<h3>Topic: Connection reuse</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Rohan Mahy</p>
<p>Rohan reports that there have been conflicting proposals to fix
open issues and that the draft has been languishing. He will reopen
discussion of the draft on the mailing list.</p>
<p>No slides presented</p>
<h3>Topic: GRUU</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Jonathan Rosenberg</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Issue: Indicating URI is a GRUU. </b><span
 style="">
Consensus emerged on not using a URI parameter to indicate that a URI
is a GRUU, but to rely on normative behavior that clients supporting
GRUU will always use a GRUU. The text will be amended based on text
submitted by Dale Worley on the SIP list. The text will also be
revised to clarify that one does not make the assumption of GRUUness
based on &#8220;Supported: gruu&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p><b>Issue: Difference between retargeting and routing.</b> </p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Retargeting - change in resource to which request is destined</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Routing - change in request destination to reach the resource to
which the request is targeted</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Proposal: 305 implies re-routing, Other 3xx imply re-targeting.
Tie to SIP outbound. Put registered contact in Route header instead
of request-URI.</p>
<p><b>Issue: GRUU usage as proposed breaks Outbound as written</b>.
This point was agreed, and led to intense discussion. Suggested by
Sean Olson that the GRUU be placed in the route header, not in the
contact. Jonathan asked for written clarification on this. Discussion
raged interminably, resulting in a decision to have an after-hours
discussion.</p>
<p>Noted that this represents a substantial change, but a huge
improvement, in general SIP routing methodology. Should this
increment or change the SIP version number? The consensus here was
&#8220;no&#8221;, although we appear to be getting very close to that
threshold.</p>
<h3>Topic: Outbound</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Cullen Jennings</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings</p>
<p><b>Issue: Config framework requires a subscribe before UA has
credentials to perform registration.</b> </p>
<p>Resolution: Use of pin-route option tag in require header agreed
to by group.</p>
<p><b>Issue : Record-Route and Reliability</b></p>
<p>Proposal: Use GRUU and don't record-route in EP</p>
<p>No discussion of issue &#8211; seemed to be general consensus on
proposal. </p>
<p><b>Issue: Service Route</b></p>
<p>Proposal: Start with configured outbound proxy, each registration
returns a service route, this service route replaces the outbound
just for that registration.</p>
<p>Discussion finally concluded that this was a not major issue, but
that some changes to Service-Route would be needed.</p>
<p><b>Issue: Should outbound have a dependency on
draft-rosenberg-sip-route-construct</b>?</p>
<p>Resolution: Take it to the list</p>
<p><b>Issue: Terminology</b></p>
<p>The flow/flow-id/connection terms are confusing and Cullen asked
for suggested new wording.</p>
<h3>Topic: Location Conveyance</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Brian Rosen, supported by James Polk</p>
<p><b>Issue:</b> Need people to look at draft</p>
<p><b>Issue: </b>Do we need a separate package or should we just use
presence package?</p>
<p>Proposal: State that it works with presence and it can be included
in other packages</p>
<p>Resolution: Discuss on list</p>
<h3>Topic: Refer Feature Parameters</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Orit Levin</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings</p>
<p><b>Issue: </b>What feature tags should be included in REFER?</p>
<p>Proposal: Update 3840 and callerprefs use cases, include all
feature tags that were listed in the most recent contact header field
of the REFER-Target.</p>
<p>Alternate proposal (Cullen proposal): Need to have a document that
gives implementers information on what feature tags to include in
what messages.</p>
<p>Resolution: Consensus as judged by chair: Move forward with
proposal for REFER as presented. Deal with Cullen's proposal
separately.</p>
<h3>Topic: Target Dialog</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Jonathan Rosenberg</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings</p>
<p><b>Issue: Proposal to extend target-dialog</b></p>
<p>Resolution: Don't do it</p>
<p><b>Issue: Handling of request with target-dialog that doesn't
exis</b>t.</p>
<p>Proposal on list was to use 481.</p>
<p>Resolution: Don't use 481, use existing text.</p>
<p>Noted by Cullen Jennings &amp; Robert Sparks that 3261 already
recommends the use of crypto-random tag values, but that existing
implementations do not use enough bits to have sufficient randomness.
This shows a need for more than rough guidance on this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Action: Revise and resubmit document.</p>
<h3>Topic: Route Construction</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Jonathan Rosenberg</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings</p>
<p>Discussion was generally favorable and the working group was asked
to consider whether this document provides sufficient additional
clarity to SIP that it should be considered under the revised charter
scope of &#8220;increasing the stability of the SIP specification&#8221;.
The consensus is favorable, and the chairs are directed to work with
the AD to establish a milestone.</p>
<p><b>TODO:</b> Chairs to work with AD to establish a milestone for
Route Construction.</p>
<h3>Topic: Dialog Event Package</h3>
<p>Discussion led by Dale Worley</p>
<p>Slides presented and included in proceedings</p>
<p>Implementations do not currently contain the information needed to
be useful.</p>
<p>So, this draft provides guidelines on how to use dialog even
package. Need implementers to review this draft and see if it helps.</p>
<p>Cullen Jennings noted that there is an ambiguity with respect to
how to signal state at the end of a call and that it would be useful
to address this in future revisions.</p>

Hi Tim,
 yes,you can consider these conditions to distinguish between poll and
 terminate subscription

 Subject: [Sip] Distinguishing subscription from polling resource state=




 I have an issue regarding RFC 3265 section 3.3.6 ? Polling Resource St=
ate
 ?.  It is clear that a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires value of 0 ma=
y
 constitute a resource query or an unsubscribe, depending upon whether =
a
 dialog exists.  If I have a proxy server wants to distinguish between
 unsubscribe and resource query, and my proxy server does not maintain
 dialog state, what message element(s) can it use to make that
 determination?





 My position is that you can use the To tag parameter (or lack of).  On=

 reading through 3261, 12.1.2 states that To tags should not be expecte=
d as
 they were not mandated in 2543 (there seems to be a lot of this lately=
).
 However, 2543 states in section 6.37-

   ?It MUST be placed in the To field of the response by each instance =
when
 there is a possibility that the request was forked at an intermediate
 proxy.?





 That RFC is silent on when it is ok to omit.  My read of this is that =
a
 UAS can only ?know? that a forking server was NOT in the path in one
 condition- if the request was sent peer to peer, without any proxy ser=
vers
 in the path.





 Accepting that, and knowing that my question is unique to scenarios wh=
en
 proxies are involved, is it ok to assume that any SUBSCRIBE request se=
nt
 by a UA (either 3261 or 2543 compliant) which passes through a proxy m=
eets
 the following conditions-


          - if a tag parameter is present in the To header, then the
          SUBSCRIBE (Expires=3D0) is in fact an unsubscribe.


          -
                                                                       =
     
          If a tag parameter is NOT present, the SUBSCRIBE (Expires=3D0=
) is a 
          polling subscribe?                                           =

Hi Rohan,

Thanks for the response.
If pin-route option is not recommended for subscription dialog (event-
Presence),
then how should the watcher behind NAT be supported ?
If GRUU is used in Contact header of SUBSCRIBE, it requires location
service lookup
for the Contact and also requires watcher to register.
Is there anyway to support watchers behind NAT (subscription dialog )
and not having GRUU ?

Regards,
Priti

Hi Priti,

This is not recommended. The first-hop proxy and the presence agent
would both have to support pin-route (which seems unlikely for the
presence agent), and the subscribe request would only be useful for
fetching immediate presence.

For the configuration framework, you can use the pin-route option to
get your configuration on bootup.  Then you should issue a new
subscription using your GRUU (once you have registered) to get change
notifications.  The reason for this is that a single dialog using the
pin-route option will only use the flow over which it was originally
sent.  If that flow dies, notifications won't get back to the
subscriber, even if another flow is available.  If you use a GRUU
registered with multiple flows for outbound, only one of them has to
work.

thanks,
-rohan

Why would it need to distinguish between "unsubscribe" and "resource
query"?  In either usage, the UAS is *required* to send a complete
status, so the response that the proxy has to process is no different.

Well, an unsubscribe *is* a polling subscribe, in that it results in one=20
last transmission of state as well as terminating the subscription.

There is also the possibility that the UAS has crashed and forgotten the=20
dialog state. In that case the UAS most likely will fail the request=20
with a 481 response. But it might recover the dialog and then terminate i=
t.

Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, a UAC might use a bogus=20
To-tag to get around you. Most UASs would probably respond with a 481,=20
but a buggy one, or one that is complicit with the UAC might accept it.

Cullen

Color me slow, but in my review of what documents (RFC, SIP or SIPPING WG 
item, or individual ID) register (or ask for the registration of) SIP 
Response codes, I came across this ID (draft-jennings-sipping-pay-03) 
having an IANA registration request for the 402 (Payment Required) Response 
code, yet 3261 already defines this code, and seemingly for what you want 
to use it for, down to the text string being identical.

Please educate me on the differences between 3261's meaning of 402 and your 
ID's, and perhaps why your ID would want to register 402 again.

cheers,
James

Hi Priti,

This is not recommended. The first-hop proxy and the presence agent 
would both have to support pin-route (which seems unlikely for the 
presence agent), and the subscribe request would only be useful for 
fetching immediate presence.

For the configuration framework, you can use the pin-route option to 
get your configuration on bootup.  Then you should issue a new 
subscription using your GRUU (once you have registered) to get change 
notifications.  The reason for this is that a single dialog using the 
pin-route option will only use the flow over which it was originally 
sent.  If that flow dies, notifications won't get back to the 
subscriber, even if another flow is available.  If you use a GRUU 
registered with multiple flows for outbound, only one of them has to 
work.

thanks,
-rohan

subscribe using a GRUU

yes

not in a manner that allows the notifier to fail over to another flow.

Hi All,

I would like to know about the usage of SIP Baic Authnetication using 
OSIP library.. I wanted to send username and password as authentication 
parameters. Its looks like the OSIP library doesn't support Basic, as it 
supports only Digest.
Please throw some light on this..

Thanks
Jijo

Hi Priti,

This is not recommended. The first-hop proxy and the presence agent
would both have to support pin-route (which seems unlikely for the
presence agent), and the subscribe request would only be useful for
fetching immediate presence.

Nagendra>> I completely agree with this in case the presence agent is
behind the Proxy. I mean if the first hop after the NAT is not the presence
agent then presence agent need not to support the pin-route option. But
what if first hop after the NAT is itself presence-server(which works as
defined in RFC 3265)?. Now it is the responsibility of the presence server
to maintaint the connection, isn't it?. In this case, can pin-route option
be a solution?

For the configuration framework, you can use the pin-route option to
get your configuration on bootup.  Then you should issue a new
subscription using your GRUU (once you have registered) to get change
notifications.  The reason for this is that a single dialog using the
pin-route option will only use the flow over which it was originally
sent.  If that flow dies, notifications won't get back to the
subscriber, even if another flow is available.  If you use a GRUU
registered with multiple flows for outbound, only one of them has to
work.

Nagendra>> But, inorder to subscribe for the status of a presentity,
watcher is not required to register first. Are you suggesting to mandate
the registration before subscription?.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Jijo,

RFC 3261 specifically states that Basic Authentication is NOT allowed for 
SIP. For this reason OSIP does NOT support this.

Cheers,

Frank

[Sip] SIP Basic Authentication
Classification








Hi All,

I would like to know about the usage of SIP Baic Authnetication using 
OSIP library.. I wanted to send username and password as authentication 
parameters. Its looks like the OSIP library doesn't support Basic, as it 
supports only Digest.
Please throw some light on this..

Thanks
Jijo

The lack of response to UPDATE can trigger a BYE.


> Why does the peer A send the message UPDATE 
> after 1O minutes time .
 
It is most likely sent to refresh the session or check if the session still
exists.


> Do you think about a bad configuration of one peer ?

It could be a bad configuration or intended behavior by the device sending
the ICMP message "destination unreachable (port unreachable)".  It depends
upon how the device allocates ports, the status of the device, and the
status of the dialog.

Hi,All
 
  I have such a doubt:
 
   In RFC 3261 17.1.1.2  Time_B timeout in Calling state,Invite transaction
transit to terminated
 
state,What if Timer_B timeout in Proceeding  state(this could happen when
the callee is not in office,
 
his softphone keep ringring until caller's timer_b timeout).
 
In my implementation my call flow like this:
 
CASE 1:
 
caller                                          callee
------------INVITE------------------->
<-----------100 Trying-----------------
<-----------180 Ringing--------------
 
caller hang up
 
--------------Cancel----------------->
<-------------200 for Cancel--------
<-------------487----------------------
---------------ACK------------------>
 
CASE 2:
 
INVITE-------------------> 
<-----------100 Trying-----------------
<-----------180 Ringing--------------
 
caller keep waiting ,Timer_b time out
 
--------------Cancel----------------->
<-------------200 for Cancel--------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
 
My question is should I generate ACK for the second case.
 
 
Thanks

Yes you must generate ACK in second case also.
=20
also, in case2) it is not "timerb timeout" as the caller received
provisional response its state machine goes to "proceeding state"
It should be some other timer implemented  at the uac to handle the case
when there is no final response in the "proceeding state"   =20

Hi,All
=20
  I have such a doubt:
=20
   In RFC 3261 17.1.1.2  Time_B timeout in Calling state,Invite
transaction transit to terminated
=20
state,What if Timer_B timeout in Proceeding  state(this could happen
when the callee is not in office,
=20
his softphone keep ringring until caller's timer_b timeout).
=20
In my implementation my call flow like this:
=20
CASE 1:
=20
caller                                          callee
------------INVITE------------------->
<-----------100 Trying-----------------
<-----------180 Ringing--------------
=20
caller hang up
=20
--------------Cancel----------------->
<-------------200 for Cancel--------
<-------------487----------------------
---------------ACK------------------>
=20
CASE 2:
=20
INVITE------------------->=20
<-----------100 Trying-----------------
<-----------180 Ringing--------------
=20
caller keep waiting ,Timer_b time out
=20
--------------Cancel----------------->
<-------------200 for Cancel--------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
=20
My question is should I generate ACK for the second case.

Thanks

Hi,
=20
As Sreeram has mentioned, it cannot be Timer B, since Timer B is not =
active
once 1xx is got.
The some other timer could be a Timer started through Expires Header
indicated in INVITE request.
=20
Thanks,
Prakash.

Hi,All

  I have such a doubt:

   In RFC 3261 17.1.1.2  Time_B timeout in Calling state,Invite transaction
transit to terminated

state,What if Timer_B timeout in Proceeding  state(this could happen when
the callee is not in office,

his softphone keep ringring until caller's timer_b timeout).

In my implementation my call flow like this:

CASE 1:

caller                                          callee
------------INVITE------------------->
<-----------100 Trying-----------------
<-----------180 Ringing--------------

caller hang up

--------------Cancel----------------->
<-------------200 for Cancel--------
<-------------487----------------------
---------------ACK------------------>

CASE 2:

INVITE------------------->
<-----------100 Trying-----------------
<-----------180 Ringing--------------

caller keep waiting ,Timer_b time out

--------------Cancel----------------->
<-------------200 for Cancel--------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------
<-------------487----------------------

My question is should I generate ACK for the second case.

<Nisha>
      According to Section 13.1 of RFC, a UAC should respond with an ACK
for every final
response that it receives. In this case, 487 is a final response therefore
an ACK must be generated in the
CASE 2 described above.

----------------------Extract from RFC
3261----------------------------------------------------------
After possibly receiving one or more provisional responses, the UAC will
get one or more 2xx responses or
one non-2xx final response. Because of the protracted amount of time it can
take to receive final responses
to INVITE, the reliability mechanisms for INVITE transactions differ from
those of other requests (like
OPTIONS). Once it receives a final response, the UAC needs to send an ACK
for every final response
it receives. The procedure for sending this ACK depends on the type of
response. For final responses
between 300 and 699, the ACK processing is done in the transaction layer
and follows one set of rules (See
Section 17). For 2xx responses, the ACK is generated by the UAC core.

---------------------------End of extract from RFC
3261---------------------------------------------------
</Nisha>

Thanks

Folks -

SIPIT 18 has been scheduled for the week of April 17, 2006 in Tokyo.
JPNIC is hosting the event, with the support of the WIDE project,  
NiCT, MIC, TTC, HATS and others.

Registration will open in a few weeks. www.sipit.net will have  
details as they become available.
I just wanted to let everyone know the date and place as soon as  
possible.

Thanks,

RjS

Might I suggest making use of the security mechanisms (authentication
context) vocabulary the SSTC @ OASIS produced [1].  Rather than requiring a
subjective gradation of various security mechanism strengths, one simply
conveys the mechanism in use for the given session. These are normatively
defined URNs in [1].

Adding new security mechanisms as above would allow sufficient
extensibility, I think.  It also allows for 'private' mechanisms, for closed
deployments.

SAML advice provides the extention point you seek for arbitrary XML:

<element name="Advice" type="saml:AdviceType"/>
    <complexType name="AdviceType">
        <choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
            <element ref="saml:AssertionIDRef"/>
            <element ref="saml:AssertionURIRef"/>
            <element ref="saml:Assertion"/>
            <element ref="saml:EncryptedAssertion"/>
            <any namespace="##other" processContents="lax"/>
        </choice>
    </complexType>
