It's possible that the user and/or UA at A may have reasons to want 
to know what went wrong at B.  Attaching logic or not sounds like an
implementation decision.
You say that the response code shouldn't matter. Should we then
return a 400 + meaningful reason phrase for everything REFER-related?
If response code isn't the right mechanism to relay REFER status,
what is?

Greetings,

I have a question about supporting the CIDB
CLASS feature.  If an E164 number is used for
addressing, i.e., the phone number is part of
the address, how can CIDB be supported?  The
trouble is in this addressing scheme, once the
number has left the originating party you cant
really control whats done with the information?

Perhaps theres something I'm overlooking here?

FM

Hi All

Can anybody help me in understanding Multicasting in SIP.
I am not able to get that who decides where multicasting has to occur, that
is at the outgoing proxy or at the UAC itself.

Suppose UAC 'a' has to multicast a request to a certain address then where
it will put the maddr parameter in the request URI or in the via header.

Now if it is in Via header then is outgoing proxy going to send the request
to this multicast address.

Thanks in Advance
Ashwani

While chatting with a peer, an IM user would typically 
like to add a third participant to the chat. 
This is currently not possible in SIP MESSAGE. 

MESSAGE rfc recommends that a group@host url should be 
used for multi-participant chatting. a group id is not 
available in peer chats that are one to one and have to 
include a third recepient (sort of CC of email UAs).

although group@host is definitely the best thing for
large chat groups, most of chat interactivity takes
place within smaller groups of people who interact with
each other and do often need to chat with about 3-4
participants at a time.

this kind of chatting can be accomplished in principle by
making each of the participants send a copy of MESSAGE to
all the other participants. If the group grows too big,
and the bandwidth gets constrained, then they ought to 
move to a scheduled group chat server. However, for most
of the times it is enough to be able to chat with 3-4
pariticipants at a time.

Do note that these groups are created without any
schedule and grow out of a 1-1 chat.
My recommendation would be that:

1. A sends B a MESSAGE, B sends a reply back with the
same Call-ID. so that we have identified a sequence of MESSAGEs that can be displayed within a particular instance of  User interface (like a window).

2. A wants C to join in the chat. A sends some reques(s) to C. At this point, what needs to be done is that:
2.1 C should get a list of all the participants from A.
2.2 C should get the group messaging ID (probably the
shared Calli-ID) for all these messages so that this 
thread of messages to the other participants can be distinguished from any other threads that maybe
concurrently engaged in by C. Alternatively, instead of 
the Call-ID, even Subject can be used (probably a 
combination of the two is going to be the only unique thing).
2.3 Others have to be informed of additon of C to the 
chat group.
2.4 All the future MESSAGEs and NOTIFYcations are send 
to the updated list of participants by all.


one possible implementation for this is that we base this on SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.

Step 1:A participant is added by sending a SUBSCRIBE to the new particpant.
Step 2:The new pariticipant responds back by accepting the SUBSCRIPTION. The participant who has added the new 
participant also sends a NOTIFY to other participants 
who can update their chat lists with the userid of the
new participant.

Hi all,

I have some questions about the AppServer Whitepaper of dynamicsoft "AN APPLICATION SERVER ARCHITECTURE FOR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES".
1. What's the CPL APIs identified in AppServer Whitepaper of dynamicsoft. Are they based on servlet APIs or CGI APIs? 
2. If there are a call forward application based on CGI and one based on servlets, and they both aim at the same enduser, which application will the event manager invoke?
3. If I want to provide Parlay APIs interface for the 3rd application provider, what should be added to the application server?

The current state draft is intended to establish a "cookie" that lasts at
least for the duration of a call leg. The cookie is tied to a call leg based
on To/From/Call-ID. Furthermore cookies are returned based on the 
host/port in the State: header. If the Request-URI matches or any
of the Route: headers match this host/port, the State: header (cookie)
is returned.
 
There is the following text in the draft as well:
 

  4.      Additional rules MAY be defined by other extensions that specify
     when a State header is to be included in a request. An example of
     this would be extensions that handle call transfers and other
     features that would specify State header processing at the UAC.

This leaves open the possibility to define an extension that uses the
State: header in the manner you describe. However, I think what you
want to do is a bit at odds with the original intention of the draft. Having
a cookie that spans call legs would require a different set of rules defining
when a UAC should return a cookie in subsequent requests or a UAS in
the 1xx responses. 
 
I would like a more generic cookie mechanism, but I think the State: header
mechanism is a reasonable compromise in terms of processing at the UA.
The alternative would be to provide additional information in the State: header
which indicated when the State: header should be returned; similar to the
path that is included in HTTP cookies.
 
e.g.
State: host/port; call-id="...";from="..."; value

Would the re-use of a state header as a means of tying together multiple call legs cause problems with anything in the state draft as written? By persistence, I'm thinking more about using the token to re-establish some value-added context of a session terminated perhaps even days earlier, but even without that concept, I need any cookie replacement to not preclude token use across multiple call legs.

The State: header is a SIP extension. I believe it can be used independently
of the other DCS extensions. The real issue is how widespread will the
extension be -- can you depend on "most" clients to support it. 
 
I'm not sure what you mean by "token persistence". Do you mean
a State: header that spans multiple call legs?

Sounds like the State header may accomplish what we are considering with cookies; there may be no need to re-invent this. How tightly coupled is the State header and the DCS call model?  In other words, to support the State header will a device have to fully conform to DCS? Or is this required only to generate state? 

Moreover, how problematic would the introduction of token persistence be to the State header? Would this cause problems with DCS implementation? Another worry: If the State header and DCS are joined at the hip, then this might be too much for simple implementations to swallow even if our own products were to comply. How much support does this proposal have in the community right now?

State headers operate in both directions.  A UAC that inserts a State header 
in the INVITE will see the contents returned in every provisional and final 
response, as well as any re-INVITE initiated by the UAS.  A UAS that 
inserts a State header into a provisional or final response will see 
the contents returned in every re-INVITE from the UAC, as well as 
provisional and final responses to requests initiated by the UAS. 
The State header is documented in draft-ietf-sip-state-01. 

Rules for handling of State headers with future extensions will need 
to be specified in the draft defining that extension. In particular, 
a REFER that is attempting to replace an existing call leg may need 
the State headers from the previous call leg attached to the new 
INVITE, along with the From/To/Call-ID.  This is all still to-be-defined.

Does DCS state only operate in one direction (ie.only from the SIP 
transaction initiator)? If so, it would need to be extended to provide 
equivalent information when two endpoints have hundreds or thousands of 
individual call legs in hundreds of sessions and either end might 
initiate any given SIP transaction. 

Also, what are the rules for passing DCS state with respect in the REFER 
case? 

If DCS state is extensible to provide an equivalent session identifier 
at both ends of any given call, then I agree that there isn't any need 
for bi-directional cookies to be grantable and remittable by either end. 
But given the current draft's focus on proxies and what appears to be a 
unidirectional call state, I'm not sure that it's complete enough to 
solve the whole problem. Please correct me if I've missed something...

Have you considered the DCS State: draft for this mechanism?  See

IMHO, I don't see a need for such a use of a Cookie. Correlating 
messages to calls is not that difficult. The key thing to note, as you 
have, is that Call-ID is not necessarily useful for tying multiple call 
legs together.

I think it would be good to clarify our terminology, particularly since 
we sometimes forget SIP does not provide directly for a call with 
multiple active call legs (i.e. B2BUA is needed to rationalize each 
individual SIP call with the overall session). I propose we define 
"call" to mean the two participants in any given transaction and 
"session" to be some collection of calls associated within a given UA 
(note that "invited by a common source" is not a complete description 
since some or all of the invites could have originated outside the UA). 
  
This thread brings out several reasons why Call-ID should not be used to 
define a "session" of multiple "calls" as defined above. Mainly because 
of this, I'm preparing an I-D to address this need through the use of 
header extensions for cookies, which each UA can independently grant and 
accept in order to correlate call legs and potentially provide 
additional context for a given call. The alternative is vendor-specific 
headers and a walled garden approach to many features available in 
conventional PBXes today, and I don't think that's beneficial for SIP in 
the long run.

Given, what you are proposing will this not mean that the definition of 
a call needs to be altered?  The reason I ask is that bis-03 defines a 
call as "identified by a globally unique callID" and "all participants 
invited by a common source".  In the case you describe under the current 
definition of a call this would mean that we would have two calls (under 
the "all participants invited by a common source" rule) but with the 
same callID (hence contravening the "globally unique callID" part).    

Comments?

Careful; I am not proposing that two call legs with the same Call-ID convey 
any semantics. Specifically, receiving an INVITE from A, while in a call 
with B, where the call-id in the INVITE from A equals the call-id in the leg 
with B, does NOT imply that this is a consultative transfer. For that, we 
have Replaces, which lists the replaced leg explicitly. 

All I am saying is that a Call-ID may be reused for local convenience, if 
desired, but that it has NO semantics outside of the entity that selected 
that call-id.

      <P><FONT size=2>I think it would be good to clarify our terminology, 
      particularly since</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>we sometimes forget SIP does 
      not provide directly for a call with</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>multiple 
      active call legs (i.e. B2BUA is needed to rationalize each</FONT> 
      <BR><FONT size=2>individual SIP call with the overall session). I propose 
      we define</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>"call" to mean the two participants in 
      any given transaction and</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>"session" to be some 
      collection of calls associated within a given UA</FONT> <BR><FONT 
      size=2>(note that "invited by a common source" is not a complete

      have originated outside the UA). </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <BR><FONT size=2>This thread brings out several reasons why Call-ID should 
      not be used to</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>define a "session" of multiple 
      "calls" as defined above. Mainly because</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>of this, 
      I'm preparing an I-D to address this need through the use of</FONT> 
      <BR><FONT size=2>header extensions for cookies, which each UA can 
      independently grant and</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>accept in order to 
      correlate call legs and potentially provide</FONT> <BR><FONT

      vendor-specific</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>headers and a walled garden

      <P><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; &gt;same call-id in the 2 INVITE requests, is 
      this allowed ? </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; </FONT><BR><FONT 
      size=2>&gt;&gt; Well, the current spec would indicate that you shouldn't 
      do this: </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; 
      &gt;The callid MUST be a globally unique identifier and MUST NOT be reused 
      for </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; &gt;later calls. </FONT><BR><FONT 
      size=2>&gt;&gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; However, I recall some 
      discussion at an IETF that people were using the same</FONT> <BR><FONT 
      size=2>&gt;&gt; call-id across different call legs as a local identifier 
      to correlate those </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; call legs. With unique 
      From tags and From fields, there really shouldn't be </FONT><BR><FONT 
      size=2>&gt;&gt; a problem, so I think its OK. However, if we are going to 
      allow it, the spec</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&gt; should reflect it. 
      Comments? </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;If 
      that's the proper way to solve this problem, then let's put that in the 
      </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;spec. But I'm not convinced that this alone 
      will solve all cases, especially </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;when this 
      correlated information needs to be presented by a call leg attempting 
      </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;to join (as in the consultative transfer 
      case). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>Careful; I am not proposing that two call legs with the 
      same Call-ID convey </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>any semantics. Specifically, 
      receiving an INVITE from A, while in a call</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>with 
      B, where the call-id in the INVITE from A equals the call-id in the leg 
      </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>with B, does NOT imply that this is a consultative 
      transfer. For that, we </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>have Replaces, which lists 
      the replaced leg explicitly. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>All I am saying is that a Call-ID may be reused for local 
      convenience, if </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>desired, but that it has NO 
      semantics outside of the entity that selected </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>that 
      call-id. </FONT></P><BR><BR>
      <P><FONT size=2>&gt; It only seems to work when the </FONT><BR><FONT 
      size=2>&gt;correlating entity initiates all the calls. If there's a 
      reliable way to </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt;correlate an incoming call leg

Folks, posts to IETF mail lists should be ASCII text only,
not HTML or rich-text.  There are members who use ASCII-only
readers.  It also keeps the mail size down considerably,
a real issue with sip, which gets lots of email in a day.

There is one other reason.  When the size of your message gets
over 40K, it is held for moderator approval.  That delays
the email, and creates work for yours truly.

Brian

The state draft indicates that when both sides set cookies, the
direction of a cookie must be deduced. Is there no explicit means for
indicating whether a header is creating a cookie or returning one?

Subject: RE: [Sip] RE: [Sipping] Call and call-id


The current state draft is intended to establish a "cookie" that lasts
at
least for the duration of a call leg. The cookie is tied to a call leg
based
on To/From/Call-ID. Furthermore cookies are returned based on the=20
host/port in the State: header. If the Request-URI matches or any
of the Route: headers match this host/port, the State: header (cookie)
is returned.
=20
There is the following text in the draft as well:
=20


  4.      Additional rules MAY be defined by other extensions that
specify
     when a State header is to be included in a request. An example of
     this would be extensions that handle call transfers and other
     features that would specify State header processing at the UAC.

This leaves open the possibility to define an extension that uses the
State: header in the manner you describe. However, I think what you
want to do is a bit at odds with the original intention of the draft.
Having
a cookie that spans call legs would require a different set of rules
defining
when a UAC should return a cookie in subsequent requests or a UAS in
the 1xx responses.=20
=20
I would like a more generic cookie mechanism, but I think the State:
header
mechanism is a reasonable compromise in terms of processing at the UA.
The alternative would be to provide additional information in the State:
header
which indicated when the State: header should be returned; similar to
the
path that is included in HTTP cookies.

e.g.
State: host/port; call-id=3D"...";from=3D"..."; value

Would the re-use of a state header as a means of tying together multiple
call legs cause problems with anything in the state draft as written? By
persistence, I'm thinking more about using the token to re-establish
some value-added context of a session terminated perhaps even days
earlier, but even without that concept, I need any cookie replacement to
not preclude token use across multiple call legs.

The State: header is a SIP extension. I believe it can be used
independently
of the other DCS extensions. The real issue is how widespread will the
extension be -- can you depend on "most" clients to support it.=20
=20
I'm not sure what you mean by "token persistence". Do you mean
a State: header that spans multiple call legs?=20

Sounds like the State header may accomplish what we are considering with
cookies; there may be no need to re-invent this. How tightly coupled is
the State header and the DCS call model?  In other words, to support the
State header will a device have to fully conform to DCS? Or is this
required only to generate state?=20

Moreover, how problematic would the introduction of token persistence be
to the State header? Would this cause problems with DCS implementation?
Another worry: If the State header and DCS are joined at the hip, then
this might be too much for simple implementations to swallow even if our
own products were to comply. How much support does this proposal have in
the community right now?

State headers operate in both directions.  A UAC that inserts a State

in the INVITE will see the contents returned in every provisional and
final=20
response, as well as any re-INVITE initiated by the UAS.  A UAS that=20
inserts a State header into a provisional or final response will see=20
the contents returned in every re-INVITE from the UAC, as well as=20
provisional and final responses to requests initiated by the UAS.=20
The State header is documented in draft-ietf-sip-state-01.=20

Rules for handling of State headers with future extensions will need=20
to be specified in the draft defining that extension. In particular,=20
a REFER that is attempting to replace an existing call leg may need=20
the State headers from the previous call leg attached to the new=20
INVITE, along with the From/To/Call-ID.  This is all still

Does DCS state only operate in one direction (ie.only from the SIP=20
transaction initiator)? If so, it would need to be extended to provide=20
equivalent information when two endpoints have hundreds or thousands of=20
individual call legs in hundreds of sessions and either end might=20
initiate any given SIP transaction.=20

Also, what are the rules for passing DCS state with respect in the REFER

case?=20

If DCS state is extensible to provide an equivalent session identifier=20
at both ends of any given call, then I agree that there isn't any need=20
for bi-directional cookies to be grantable and remittable by either end.

But given the current draft's focus on proxies and what appears to be a=20
unidirectional call state, I'm not sure that it's complete enough to=20
solve the whole problem. Please correct me if I've missed something...=20

IMHO, I don't see a need for such a use of a Cookie. Correlating=20
messages to calls is not that difficult. The key thing to note, as you=20
have, is that Call-ID is not necessarily useful for tying multiple call=20
legs together.=20

I think it would be good to clarify our terminology, particularly since=20
we sometimes forget SIP does not provide directly for a call with=20
multiple active call legs (i.e. B2BUA is needed to rationalize each=20
individual SIP call with the overall session). I propose we define=20
"call" to mean the two participants in any given transaction and=20
"session" to be some collection of calls associated within a given UA=20
(note that "invited by a common source" is not a complete description=20
since some or all of the invites could have originated outside the UA).=20
 =20
This thread brings out several reasons why Call-ID should not be used to

define a "session" of multiple "calls" as defined above. Mainly because=20
of this, I'm preparing an I-D to address this need through the use of=20
header extensions for cookies, which each UA can independently grant and

accept in order to correlate call legs and potentially provide=20
additional context for a given call. The alternative is vendor-specific=20
headers and a walled garden approach to many features available in=20
conventional PBXes today, and I don't think that's beneficial for SIP in

the long run.=20

Given, what you are proposing will this not mean that the definition of=20
a call needs to be altered?  The reason I ask is that bis-03 defines a=20
call as "identified by a globally unique callID" and "all participants=20
invited by a common source".  In the case you describe under the current

definition of a call this would mean that we would have two calls (under

the "all participants invited by a common source" rule) but with the=20
same callID (hence contravening the "globally unique callID" part).   =20

Careful; I am not proposing that two call legs with the same Call-ID
convey=20
any semantics. Specifically, receiving an INVITE from A, while in a call

with B, where the call-id in the INVITE from A equals the call-id in the
leg=20
with B, does NOT imply that this is a consultative transfer. For that,
we=20
have Replaces, which lists the replaced leg explicitly.=20

All I am saying is that a Call-ID may be reused for local convenience,

Hi again,

First, thanks for the help with the CIDB feature,
I'll look at the privacy draft.

Second, I have an additional question having to do
with call forwarding.  Lets say we have a call that
arrives at a SIP user agent and call forwarding is
active at that user agent.  Further, lets assume
that part of the call is carried over the PSTN.

There are two possibilities, 1) the call is forwarded
to another SIP location, and 2) the call is forwarded
to another phone that is on the PSTN.

It seems to me that in the first case, only SIP
redirection is necessary and that this may be
transparent to the PSTN leg of the call?  In the
second case, there may be some SS7 interaction
required.  Has anyone looked at this and if so is
there any documentation on preferred approaches?
If not, does anyone have any thoughts on how it
should be done?

Thanks,
FM

You are correct. I've changed the description as follows:

"Return session identity (rpi-id-type="return")

This provides the URL to which the party wishes return session initiations (as
opposed to new transactions within this call leg) to be addressed. For example a
business may wish to provide a 'freephone' identity to encourage future return
calls. If absent, the return session identity is assumed to be the same as the
subscriber identity. "

Chandra,

TPKT (RFC 1006) would have been the logical thing to do.  However, as SIP is
an ASCII-based protocol, which requires the parsers to look though long
strings like "Content-Length" for information (then perform expensive
arithmetic in order to actually calculate the length in this case), using
TPKT would look like a "kludge" in the protocol.

While the IETF has a history of engineering more efficient protocols, SIP
was not engineered with processing efficiency in mind.

Paul

Andy,

I had the impression that the nature of the cookie was such that only the 
creator new what was encoded.  The suggestion about setting direction was 
to enable that node to determine whether the cookie was being returned by 
whichever side.

Also, in response to the previous email, While the description was targeted 
to a simple 2-way communication, I was not under the impression that there 
was any guidance concerning multi-way calls.  I would presume that it would 
be an implementation detail, unless explicitly defined.

Mike

SIP is based on HTTP and you can blame HTTP for this particular aspect
of SIP. Using a Content-Length header is perfectly logical, BTW.

Cheap shot. The issue of text based vs. ASN.1 has been amply debated and

I'm putting together the SUB/NOT draft (we should go into nits
on Monday), and am currently wrestling with the issue of forking.

I have what I think is an elegant solution, given the immediate
NOTIFY mechanism that we have agreed on. Certain camps have objections
to this mechanism, and thinks that all but the first SUBSCRIBE should
be made to fail (by sending a 400 class response). I don't see this
difference of opinion as intractable, but it is something that will
take a considerable amount of time (discussion, work, etc) to reach
consensus.

On reflection, I realize that this entire situation just highlights
a thorn we've had in our paw the entire time.

Given that all transactions complete (basically) immediately (with
the exception of INVITEs), forking *any* non-INVITE request is just
a race waiting to happen. It usually just leads to heartburn when
you attempt to analyze how it's going to work with non-INVITE methods
(as in the SUBSCRIBE example).

Since there seems to be a general feeling that all but the first
received request should "fail" in some general sense (usually by
the request initiator not finding out about the response), I'd
like to float a proposal:

Deprecate forking of non-INVITEs.

Despite my tongue-in-cheek subject line, I'm serious.

SIP is not going to Draft Standard this time around, so maintaining
absolute compatibility with RFC 2543 isn't strictly required. No one
has come up with a useful application of forking non-INVITEs (except,
arguably, my proposal that a forked SUBSCRIBE can install several
subscriptions, with the subsequent NOTIFY messages establishing the
legs, routes, and contacts as necessary). Forking non-INVITEs adds
complexity to the protocol, extra work to all extensions, and
headaches all around. And as long as people insist that nothing useful
can come from forking anything but an INVITE, there is no gain to be
had by leaving this "feature" in the protocol.

As long as it is understood at a general protocol level that forking
of non-INVITEs is disallowed, I have no problem rejecting the additional
NOTIFY legs we find out about. If we continue to pretend that forking
of non-INVITEs is a useful concept, I can't see the logic behind refusing
to allow successful forking of SUBSCRIBEs.

Comments, etc, encouraged -- even if just to voice assent.

You said "TPKT (RFC 1006) would have been the logical thing to do". This
implies SIP is doing something less logical wouldn't you say?

SIP clearly puts cleanliness and simplicity above efficiency. I believe
it's fair to say that this has proven to be a winning strategy for
protocol design.

Okay, let's rein this one in folks.

SIP is what it is, and we are not likely to change the
way it works (and it DOES work).

Unless there is anything much more substantive, let's leave
this thread die.

Guys,

I did not want to start a debate over whether SIP is good or bad. 
I wanted to understand why SIP can not use TPKT. TPKT is defined 
at(/immediately over) transport layer. 

IMHO, using TPKT is more efficient than SIP/HTTP solution. 
(Don't anybody get emotional(defensive). I am not criticizing any
protocol)

If there is any possibility of influencing the implementation
standard to use TPKT, let's work on it. 

Let's talk about pros/cons without getting emotional.

Thanks,
Chandra.

I don't see how my response was emotional or defensive. I assure you it
wasn't meant to be.

The point is that SIP is not designed to squeeze every last bit of
efficiency out of the network, and that this is a good thing. Noone is
arguing that TPKT wouldn't save a bit of network traffic but it would be
at the cost of making the protocol more ugly by special casing TCP from
UDP and breaking with how HTTP and MIME generally works. For these
reasons, and probably many more like it, what you're proposing is a
non-starter.

I'll shut up now.

I see a couple of problems with this proposal. The first is that the
URI to which the remote party has been referred may be something other
than a SIP URL. So, while synthesizing a response like you describe
above may make some sense, creating a whole new message for the remote
service may be bizarre.

For example, I believe it reasonable for a implementation which can
accept REFERs to "ftp:" URLs to map "550 Requested action not taken"
to "404 Not Found," I think it's a bit ludicrous to expect this
implementation to then go and invent a variety of headers to tack
onto this 404 for the purposes of determining where the error occurred.

The second problem, I believe, stems from the fact that several
parties at the interim meeting expressed some strong privacy
concerns about being "required" to include response header information
in NOTIFY requests related to REFER.

I admire the problem, but think the proposed solution is a hack based
on a hack. I suspect we can do better.

The problem is not so much INVITE vs. SUBSCRIBE than a classic case of
state management. The reason INVITE supports forking is the three ways
handshake in the INVITE/200/ACK sequence, which allows for cancellation
of branches that are not selected. We can only subscribe forking in
methods that either have no side effect (e.g. Notify) or that include a
three ways handshake.

There are quite a few reasons to support forking -- think for example of
doing discovery through a multicast channel. But we must make sure that
if a SUBSCRIBE request is multicast or forked, a three ways handshake is
requested before any notification is sent. We could possibly achieve
that by having a specific acceptation code, e.g. "I received a forked
subscribe, I am ready to serve you, but please confirm first."

The problem, of course, with requiring a three-way handshake involving
the response to the method is that forking proxies drop all but the first
response (except for INVITEs), so sending a forward indication to
complete the handshake is impossible. Any non-INVITE three-way handshake
which will survive forking must be something like a request in the
forward direction, a request in the backwards direction, and a response
to the second request.

I don't think it's the notification you're worried about; as you just
stated, NOTIFY is one of a class of "methods that... have no side effect."
Your concern is installation of long running state at the notifier node;
my proposal to the forked SUBSCRIBE issue can be implemented in such a way
that such state is not created.

> We could possibly achieve
> that by having a specific acceptation code, e.g. "I received a forked
> subscribe, I am ready to serve you, but please confirm first."

As I pointed out above, using a response code for this isn't possible,
since only the first response survives the forking proxy.

However, if I take the intention of your statement instead of the
implied implementation, this is fundamentally what I have been proposing
all along: I send a SUBSCRIBE; the response is merely for reliability. I
then receive multiple NOTIFYs. If I am willing to have these subscriptions
outstanding, I send a 200 class response; it's then my responsibility to
make sure they each get updated as appropriate. If I want them not to
exist, I send a 400 class response (nominally a 481).

There's your three way handshake: SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY/200. It works very
elegantly.

But there are people who counterargue that, even though this is
a technically feasible solution (and, in fact, one we will have to
outlaw by fiat if we don't want it to happen, since we basically
get it for free), there are some philosophical problems yet to be
solved about having multiple subscriptions outstanding.

I'll admit that, in certain circumstances, this might not make sense;
those packages can dictate that all but one NOTIFY be answered with
a 481. I argue that this mechanism can be useful in other circumstances,
and disallowing it merely makes the protocol less flexible.

My intention in this thread wasn't to fight this battle; in fact, my
intention was explicitly to avoid it. I believed that all parties
involved had an understanding of the current situation and viewpoints,
and that we could remove the problem instead of solving it. If that
isn't the case, we can take the philosophical discussion of whether
forked subscriptions are legal on the SIP events list.

Hello Jonathan,

> Ugly, and not my preference, but I see no other viable
> alternative without sacrificing backwards compatibility.

In this situation, I believe we should have a clear idea of what we
understand by backwards compatibility. When a new feature is added, it
usually means that the addition of the new feature does not break all
the implementations that already work properly (but do not provide the
new feature).

However, in this scenario, there cannot be any implementation that works
properly right now. They just cannot send RTCP properly. Therefore, in
this situation, an elegant brand new mechanism might be acceptable. I do
not think that it would be a big deal to "break" current implementations
that do not work properly anyway.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hmmm. It would sound like we have a few options
for forking of a non-INVITE:

1) Disallow it

This seems to be easiest, even if there are potential
benefits to forking non-INVITEs. It certainly makes
things easier for forking proxies.

2) Wrap it in a INVITE "signalling session"

ala MESSAGE. This allows us to find a path to a
"single best" destination (first come, first serve)
By wrapping it in INVITE, we allow multiple destinations
to actually answer. There is a small issue here with
overhead in signalling.

3) Describe the semantics of forking of a non-INVITE
   for each possible extension

We hack a solution together specific to each extension.
Highly undesireable.

4) Create a PROBE method that allows us to find
   a single threaded path through. Similar to (2) above,
   but only one party could answer. PROBE == OPTIONS provided
   we allow forking of OPTIONS.

This is ugly. Just listed for completeness.

I prefer (1) or (2), leaning towards (1). I don't think
adding three-way handshakes to other extensions is the
way to go. Unless people want to allow ACK for non-INVITEs 
(no flames please, just a bit of humor)

I posted this on the bell-labs list this morning
but have been advised to move to the ietf list 
instead.

I have a question having to do with call forwarding.
Lets say we have a call that arrives at a SIP user
agent and call forwarding is active at that user
agent.  Further, lets assume that part of the call
is carried over the PSTN.

There are two possibilities, 1) the call is forwarded
to another SIP location, and 2) the call is forwarded
to another phone that is on the PSTN.

It seems to me that in the first case, only SIP
redirection is necessary and that this may be
transparent to the PSTN leg of the call?  In the
second case, there may be some SS7 interaction
required.  Has anyone looked at this and if so is
there any documentation on preferred approaches?
If not, does anyone have any thoughts on how it
should be done?

Thanks,
FM

This is not quite true. If you require a 3 ways handshake, then the
forking proxy will only carry the first positive response, and will
reject the other ones; but in a 3-ways handshake mode, it should reply
with a "cancel" if it drops a positive response. The positive response
will have to be an ACCK, or very similar. Obviously, if proxies drop all
responses but one, only one responder will receive the ACK; the other
ones would have sent negative responses, or would have receive a cancel,
or would have time out before receiving the ack if the proxy failed to
cancel. The mechanism can be extended to multicast operation.

The SIP extensions for Instant Messaging and Presence are currently
discussed in the SIMPLE working group rather than the SIP WG. You can
subscribe to the SIMPLE WG mailing list (or access the archives) by going
to:

http://mailman.dynamicsoft.com/mailman/listinfo/simple

FYI in light of your proposal below, a forthcoming issue of the document set
on the MESSAGE method defines a new way of setting up an IM session between
two parties that uses the INVITE method with a special SDP indicating that
MESSAGEs are to be exchanged directly between the parties. As it turns out,
this allow the IM extension to take advantage of the conferencing methods
used for VoIP, including building an IM 'conference server' or even probably
using some fully-meshed models if you were so inclined. If you glance
through the archives of the SIMPLE mailing list, you'll find some further
information on this, or you can wait for the new drafts (which should appear
in the relatively short term).

From: Ashhar Farhan [mailto:afarhan@rediffmail.com]
Sent: Monday, July 02, 2001 1:22 AM
To: sip@ietf.org
Subject: [Sip] Adhoc group messaging


While chatting with a peer, an IM user would typically 
like to add a third participant to the chat. 
This is currently not possible in SIP MESSAGE. 

MESSAGE rfc recommends that a group@host url should be 
used for multi-participant chatting. a group id is not 
available in peer chats that are one to one and have to 
include a third recepient (sort of CC of email UAs).

although group@host is definitely the best thing for
large chat groups, most of chat interactivity takes
place within smaller groups of people who interact with
each other and do often need to chat with about 3-4
participants at a time.

this kind of chatting can be accomplished in principle by
making each of the participants send a copy of MESSAGE to
all the other participants. If the group grows too big,
and the bandwidth gets constrained, then they ought to 
move to a scheduled group chat server. However, for most
of the times it is enough to be able to chat with 3-4
pariticipants at a time.

Do note that these groups are created without any
schedule and grow out of a 1-1 chat.
My recommendation would be that:

1. A sends B a MESSAGE, B sends a reply back with the
same Call-ID. so that we have identified a sequence of MESSAGEs that can be
displayed within a particular instance of  User interface (like a window).

2. A wants C to join in the chat. A sends some reques(s) to C. At this
point, what needs to be done is that:
2.1 C should get a list of all the participants from A.
2.2 C should get the group messaging ID (probably the
shared Calli-ID) for all these messages so that this 
thread of messages to the other participants can be distinguished from any
other threads that maybe
concurrently engaged in by C. Alternatively, instead of 
the Call-ID, even Subject can be used (probably a 
combination of the two is going to be the only unique thing).
2.3 Others have to be informed of additon of C to the 
chat group.
2.4 All the future MESSAGEs and NOTIFYcations are send 
to the updated list of participants by all.


one possible implementation for this is that we base this on
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.

Step 1:A participant is added by sending a SUBSCRIBE to the new particpant.
Step 2:The new pariticipant responds back by accepting the SUBSCRIPTION. The
participant who has added the new 
participant also sends a NOTIFY to other participants 
who can update their chat lists with the userid of the
new participant.

Anders,

Ah, you're right: my words did imply that SIP's method was illogical, didn't
it?  Sorry.

Indeed, SIP's method is logical, just less efficient in terms of detecting
message boundaries.

What? You lost me there. Who is sending the cancel, and to whom?
The proxy to the subscriber? The proxy to the node receiving the
SUBSCRIBE request? The node receiving the SUBSCRIBE request to the
proxy? The subscriber to the proxy? I can't envision any scenario
in which this makes sense without some radical changes to the way
that SIP works.

I fear you may be speaking from a theoretical standpoint. The prospect
that I would be able to convince anyone to completely rework the way
that SIP proxies operate (and on a method-by-method basis, even) is a
bit overoptimistic.

In the case of "subscribe", a proxy that drops a definitive & positive
response is doing something harsh to the responding user agent. The UA
has installed state as a result of the SUBSCRIBE, and by dropping the
response the proxy is making sure that this state will become useless.
It seems that sending back some form of cancellation would be
appropriate.

Indeed, as you point out, we cannot expect all proxies to be modified to
a new behavior. This is why we have to have an end-to-end mechanism that
confirms that a subscription is valid, the equivalent of an ACK. In the
absence of such confirmation, the presentity can clear the subscribe
"session."

Indeed, the three-ways handshake is only needed if we want to ensure
that we have exactly one respondent for any given subscribe session.
Another possibility is to leave a session active on every UA that sent a
positive response. The watcher will receive several NOTIFY, from various
presentity, and may be able to sort it out.

On the other hand, I don't believe that just banning fork is an option.
Fork may happen "naturally", e.g. if an acknowledgement is lost, the
subscribe is repeated, and a stateless proxy routes the repeated
subscribe to a different presentity. Fork also happens naturally if the
subscribe request is sent over a multicast channel. We must have a way
to go from there to a deterministic behavior.

You can implement it in such a fashion that the session isn't
"active" until the first (required, immediate) NOTIFY is
answered with a 200 class response. It **IS** a three-way
handshake.

The major difference between your "natural" forks and an intentional
fork is that *all* responses to your "natural" forks will be
received by the node that sent the request (unless suppressed by
the remote end, in which case there is no problem); intentional forks
will go through a proxy which drops all but the first positive
response.

I also am in favor of a=neithersendnorrecv (or perhaps a=hold would read
better). 

This differs from c=0.0.0.0 or a special port (I think port zero means
something else. I have seen port 9 suggested for this.) The a= approach
modifies how the transport(s) are used, but doesn't alter their
assignment, while changing c= or the port implies changes in assignment.
In the case of UDP this may not matter much, but in the case of
connection oriented media it can be very important. In the case of a
connection oriented media session, specifying c=0.0.0.0 could require
establishing a different connection to continue communication in the
other direction, or it could make it impossible to continue
communication in the other direction.

So, I think specifying a=sendonly or a=neithersendnorrecv should be
sufficient and recommended as the way to put oneself on hold. Messing
with the c= or the port should be considered an optional change that an
endpoint can make when it is consistent with the form of communication
being negotiated.

Greetings all: 

Regarding on the issue in subject, in ITU-T, there is the Q.1600
recommendation that establishes special rules for INAP and ISUP
interworking. Thus, I am inferring that will be the same for SIP. Does this
interworking encapsulate ISUP in MIME attachment in MGC that is a SSP?  Or
is there any special call scenario set to accommodate the SIP/INAP
interworking? What is the state of the art today? I.e., is there any
recommendation/draft?

Thanks for any return,
Alberto.

All,

I like the option of using just a=sendonly to put an existing two-way
session on hold - it makes much more sense than c=0.0.0.0 for all the
reasons given in this thread. Is there any difference (for a two-way media
stream) between 'held' state and 'sendonly' state ? I'm sure SIP will not
save us from crappy 'music' on hold, so there may still be media in the
other direction.

Also, in a multi-media session I might want to put one media stream on hold
whilst still receiving another. I can only really listen to one person at a
time, but I can see multiple video sessions on my PC screen. So I might put
the audio of a videocall on hold whilst I make a consultation call to
another party.

In the case of a one-way session, putting this on hold basically temporarily
cancels the media stream altogether. As someone suggested, it would be nice
to have an a=neithersendnorrecv to complete the possibilities of sendonly,
recvonly, sendrecv, but would another alternative in this case would be to
set the port to zero ?

Regards,

Mark Watson

an existing two-way session on hold - it makes much more sense than =
c=3D0.0.0.0 for all the reasons given in this thread. Is there any =
difference (for a two-way media stream) between 'held' state and =
'sendonly' state ? I'm sure SIP will not save us from crappy 'music' on =
hold, so there may still be media in the other direction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Also, in a multi-media session I might want to put =
one media stream on hold whilst still receiving another. I can only =
really listen to one person at a time, but I can see multiple video =
sessions on my PC screen. So I might put the audio of a videocall on =
hold whilst I make a consultation call to another party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In the case of a one-way session, putting this on =
hold basically temporarily cancels the media stream altogether. As =
someone suggested, it would be nice to have an a=3Dneithersendnorrecv =
to complete the possibilities of sendonly, recvonly, sendrecv, but =
would another alternative in this case would be to set the port to zero =
?</FONT></P>

Dear All,

Sorry for those who get this twice.
In draft-ietf-sip-call-auth-01.txt, Authorization-Token is introduced.
In 5.2.3, it reads:
		5.2.3. Originating Proxy (OP) 
		The Originating Proxy (OP) authenticates the caller, and
verifies the caller is authorized to receive the requested level of QoS. In
cooperation with originating Policy Decision Point (PDP-o), the OP obtains
and/or generates a Media-Authorization-Token that contains sufficient
information for the UAC to get the authorized bandwidth for the media
streams. 
My question is:  if Caller supports 5 codec, callee returns 3 of the five in
its 183 response, how does the OP know what the final codec is going to be
used. In other words, how does the OP generate a token which "contains
SUFFICIENT information for the UAC to get the authorized bandwidth for the
media streams."?
For the terminating side, the token is generated when INVITE comes in, same
question: how does the terminating proxy generate a token which "contains
SUFFICIENT information for the UAC to get the authorized bandwidth for the
media streams."?
Only PRACK for a 183 contains SUFFICIENT information for the media which is
going to be used. So, if the token is used for QoS Authorization, only PRACK
can trigger this procedure.
Or maybe I misunderstand the popurse of the Token, please point out what I
missed.

thanks

Not sure which is the right list for this
one...

Has anyone thought about whats necessary
for SIP to be used to invoke TCAP functions
on the SS7 network?  For example, a SIP
UA may need to perform a TCAP dip for
a Calling Name on an incoming call.

I've looked over the mailing list archives
and meetings minutes and found some cursory
references to TCAP but nothing substantially
similar to what I'm asking here.  I'd luv
it if I have overlooked or not heard of 
something.

I have thought of allowing TCAP invokations
to be carried in INFO messages.  The invokation
could be carried as a MIME type that is a
text represenation of the TCAP method and
parameters.  This representation could be
translated into SS7 at the signaling gateway.

I'm working on the specifics of it but would
like to get some feedback before I waste too
much time on it.

Thanks,
FM

Hi

I am trying to follow up on some previous discussions on this list about
whether to use dynamic
payload types for various flavors of the G729 codec. Presently the
IANA list has defined a static payload type
and encoding name only for the G729r8 codec. Should we be using dynamic
payloads for G729b, G729ab, G729a ?
And use X-* as encoding names ? I am sure we cannot use the same static
payload value (18) for all these flavors.

- Ameet

Content-Type: text/plain;

Greetings SIPers,
 
I am coming from 3GPP point of view where SIP is used to initiate Multimedia
Sessions.  I had a rather naive question regarding the handling of
unsupported media type in SDP. Currently, the proxy (S-CSCF) sets the port
number to 0 for all unsupported media types while leaving all media
information and attributes in the message traveling through the network and
over the air. I was wondering, Is there specific reason for that?
 
Further, If the media type is not supported and the end terminal can not use
it, why not delete the whole entry and save the bandwidth? Just wondering!
 
Feedback is always welcomed and excuse my ignorance.
 
Regards,
 
Kamel Shaheen, Ph.D.

All new codecs only use dynamic payload types.

Using X-* is a certifiably bad idea. The argument has been made numerous
times on this list, but let me know if you'd like another rendition of
it.

> static payload value (18) for all these flavors.

You can use the same payload type (doesn't matter if static or dynamic)
if the codecs are distinguishable by looking at the payload. G.729a is
just a reduced-complexity implementation, that has the same bit pattern,
so there doesn't seem to be a need for a new payload type.

G.729 is silence suppression and distinguishable by payload length.

I have no idea what G.729ab would be; it is not mentioned at
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/rec/g/g700-799/index.html

Hi,

We have been asked to subscribe to ietf.org mailing lists but till now
we receive no intimation.
Moreover, We are still getting mails in lists.bell_labs.com.

Any error on our part?

"G.729 is silence suppression and distinguishable by payload

Where could I find information on the payload length supporting
silence suppression for G.711 and G.729b?

Thanks.

Using X-* is a certifiably bad idea. The argument has been made
numerous
times on this list, but let me know if you'd like another

You can use the same payload type (doesn't matter if static or
dynamic)
if the codecs are distinguishable by looking at the payload.
G.729a is
just a reduced-complexity implementation, that has the same bit
pattern,
so there doesn't seem to be a need for a new payload type.

G.729 is silence suppression and distinguishable by payload
length.

I have no idea what G.729ab would be; it is not mentioned at
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/rec/g/g700-799/index.html

If caller sends 5 codecs, and your caller returned 3, the caller has
returned a preferred list where the first codec from the 3 will be picked
by proxy/caller UAC. So really, the one codec that got negotiated is
known after the 183 is received at the OP in your case.
The Media-Auth token can be generated.

Hi

-G.729 is CS-ACELP, an 8kbps speech Codec (G.729r8)
-G.729a (G.729 Annex A) is a reduced complexity version of G.729 and is
still an 8k voice Codec
-G.729b (G.729 Annex B) is a spec for Voice Activity Detection (VAD),
Discontinuity Transmission (DTX), and Comfort Noise Generation (CNG). More
simply stated, Annex B is silence suppression for use with G.729 or G.729a
voice codecs and is not a codec in itself. 

G.729 and G.729a operate on a 10 mSec speech frame corresponding to 80
samples at a rate of 8kbps. This yields an 80bit speech fame every 10 mSec.
If silence suppression etc. are used (such as Annex B), the frame length
will vary. In the case of annex B, SID frames are 15 bits rather than 80
bits for a speech frame.

Hope that helps
Shawn

But in terminating side, the token is generated when INVITE comes the callee
side proxy, at that moment, how does the proxy know the codecs supported by
callee?

If caller sends 5 codecs, and your caller returned 3, the caller has
returned a preferred list where the first codec from the 3 will be picked
by proxy/caller UAC. So really, the one codec that got negotiated is
known after the 183 is received at the OP in your case.
The Media-Auth token can be generated.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP-Specific Event Notification
	Author(s)	: A. Roach
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-events-00.txt
	Pages		: 32
	Date		: 05-Jul-01
	
This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide an
extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request notification
from remote nodes indicating that certain events have occurred.
Concrete uses of the mechanism described in this document may be
standardized in the future.
Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are
NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all
classes of event subscription and notification.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-events-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-events-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-events-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

You are confusing the bandwidth authorization with the bandwidth 
reservation step.
The token is generated during the authorization stage when the codec
type or its bandwidth requirements is not necessarily needed.

Only when one goes to reserve the network bandwidth is the codec type
required and of course the token as well.

For your case at the DP, look at section 6.1.2, Figure 2. Only after the 183
message has reached the UAS, the UAS generates a RSVP-PATHt message that
needs the codec info etc. and the auth token.

Hi,

    I needed clarification on a few aspects of the SIP Server and Application Server interface. 
    Please give necessary and applicable pointers if this is a repeat question
    on this list. Thanks in advance and in anticipation of a response.

    Some of the functional blocks that I would attribute to a SIP Server would typically
    be: Basic Call Processing, Routing, Subscriber Service Data Management (may
    be an HLR/VLR function or access to the same), Accounting, and other support
    functions. 

    Further, the intention would then be to have another platform (the AS) that can house
     all services - be it CLASS-4-like services (like toll-free or LNP) or
     typical CLASS-5 services (subscriber initiated services, IP Centrex) and
    others of the likes of Pre-paid, Meet-me Conference, Click-to-talk, etc. 

    This is very similar to the Softswitch requirements of the ISC-Softswitch Architecture.

    Few questions on the above:
1> Can I build an AS that is normally not in the path of the call flow and that is brought
   into the call flow only when a certain *trigger* and its associated criteria
   is detected? Analogous to the IN wherein a trigger (DP) may be armed with a
   certain criteria and when the DP and the criteria match, the service key
   (which may be the Request-URI here) is delivered to the SCP (the AS here),
   probably through an INVITE.

2> If the above is possible, then is it possible to use SIP (over the AS-SIP Server interface)
 in a manner in which the AS can instruct the SIP Server to arm (or monitor)
more events for only this call?  If so, how is this reported (the mechanism) -
in-call arming and in-call reporting of events?

3> How are typically Call Party Handling operations carried out over this
interface? Is a fine-grained control possible, as through INAP? I have gone
through the proposed architecture for Application Server components (draft
-rosenberg-sip-app-components-01.txt)  and still would want some info on this
aspect.

4> SIP baseline package propounds how a number of services such as Call Forwarding, 
Call Transfer, Call Hold etc. are to be handled. But suppose I want to provide
an AS that can house all CLASS-5 features, what would it really take? This AS
would then turn out to be a Call Stateful Proxy, with every call going through
it. Is this what is then intended? But this would limit the scalability of the
platform and not render the same to third-party involvement!?

    Coming to what the Network Architects really thought how things would work:

5> What is the SIP interface between the SIP Proxy and the AS really used for?
 Is it for call supervision or for transferring the handling of call
processing from the SIP Proxy to the AS? Again the issue of "the condition"
under which this happens comes to the fore!

6> Services like 3PCC are the easy part for the AS to address. Other services
 that are explicitly targeted by the INVITE from the UA are also probably
fine, but what about call handling services? CPL would not help here as it is
for the terminating side of the call. What about the originating side services? 

7> Some conditions at the SIP Proxy, such as routing failure, may be taken care of at the Proxy
 itself through local/centralized policies. How would these then interact with
a third-pary application on an AS - that tie with similar triggers? If some
services are handled by the SIP Proxy and others by the AS, isnt there a
perceived danger of complex Feature Interactions happening down-the-line?

    The above is definitely not something that would not have been addressed in some forum.
 I would appreciate if the above can either be discussed here or pointers to a
prior discussion on the same can be shared. Thanks!

Regards,
Gautham A.N.

A couple of nits:

1) Section 6.1.1 para 5 says "initiates a Policy-Setup message to POP-o.".
The target should probably be PDP-o, not POP-o.

2) 6.1.1. para 3 says "Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the other
end-point sends a 183
   response to the initial INVITE, forwarded back to OP. The sentence should
probably end "proxied back to OP." This change would avoid semantic conflict
on "forwarded".

3) Section 6.1.1 p5 says "
   When OP receives the 183, it has sufficient information regarding the
end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It
initiates a Policy-Setup message to POP-o."
-- I would like to see more discussion of how it actually gets this from the
SDP, especially as there may be 37 codecs listed.Or is this covered in
manyfolks? If so, there's a reference problem.

Folks,

Another inconsistency between the .txt and .ps/.pdf versions of bis has been
pointed out to me. The difference is in the section on URL comparison. The
.ps/.pdf says:

Thus, the following URLs are equivalent:
sip:juser@%65xample.com:5060
sip:juser@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=udp
while
SIP:JUSER@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=udp
sip:juser@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=UDP

are not.

whilst the .txt says:

Thus, the following URLs are equivalent:

   sip:juser@
   sip:juser@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=udp


   while

   SIP:JUSER@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=udp
   sip:juser@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=UDP


   are not.


The .txt has missed the stuff following the %65. This is some kind of latex
or compilation problem of sorts. To be clear, the hostport piece of the URL
is mandatory, and thus sip:juser@ is not even a valid SIP URL. The .pdf/.ps
is correct, the .txt is wrong.

I will get this fixed in -04. My aplogies.

-Jonathan R.

Please send me any requests for agenda time in SIP at IETF 51.

Note that we will NOT be doing presentations of materials that are not the
subject of active discussion in teh working groups. We would like to
concentrate on resolving any issues with current work or potential work
already under dicussion on teh lists.

Thanks.

I was going to compose a long refutation of the
contention that using Call-ID for the overlap
solution is inappropriate.

I'll forgo that, though; Bob has summed up the
key argument quite concisely. I couldn't agree
more.

Hi

The fact is that g.729 /g.729a  pair shall not interoperate with
g.729b/g.729ab.
The static payload '18' defined so far is being used for g.729/g.729a by

SIP folks  .
Some are now interested in using g.729b/g.729ab pair for obvious
advantages in
VAD,DTX etc.

So, my question is that why don't we have a static payload defined for
g.729b/g729ab
pair just like we had '18' for the other pair.

Or is it legal to use '18' for this pair too ?

To avoid interop issues, can we lay down rules to state that when to use
'18' and when
not to use '18' especially if a SIP-UA agent has the ability to support
'all' the four flavors of
g729 and is interested in advertising that in its SDP ?

thanks
-manoj

Hi There, 

You don't need a different payload type for 729b/729ab as you can determine
that you are receiving silence from the payload length. Voice is nx10 bytes
and silence is 4 bytes. Silence and Voice can be sent together giving
(nx10)+4 as payload length hence payload type 18 along with payload length
is enough to determine what is being sent. 

As 729a and 729 codecs can also interoperate with one-another, you don't
need to distinguish between the 2 payloads. 

Hope that helps
Shawn

The rules for use and signalling of G.729 in RTP are defined in:
	draft-ietf-avt-profile-new-10.txt
and 	draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mime-04.txt

According to those drafts, it is legal to use payload type 18 for Annex B
frames (indeed, that is the default). They also define a parameter for use
in SDP a=fmtp: lines to explicitly signal the presence/absence of annex B 
frames if that is necessary.

If there are problems with these definitions, they should be brought to the
attention of the AVT working group, since the revised profile is about to
be submitted for publication as a draft standard RFC.

Well, I've made the less modest proposal before that forking could be
removed entirely from the specification. It seems to be an unpopular
suggestion in some quarters, but I like to bring it up before IETF meetings
as a matter of tradition (and in hopes that someday certain critical parties
will agree).

Admittedly, most of you people are way brighter than me. But I find that the
branches and tags and special cases and stuff introduced to make forking
work regularly confuse my pointy little head, and seem to occasionally trip
up other folks as well. It really makes me sweat every time I have to think
about how a proposed extension will interact with forking, and in the Texas
summer, extra perspiration could be dangerous.

On the other hand I have to admit that I do USE forking all the time --
inbound calls to my phone hit a forking proxy and land on three SIP phones
and my cell phone roughly simultaneously.

But it also seems that what we desired from forking could be readily
implemented as application logic without as much complexity in the core
protocol, and I think such an application would meet my needs as a forking
user (I've always wanted to say that about users). This would also allow
forking-like behavior for new messages on an as-needed-by-application-logic
basis. And acceptance of such a proposal would settle once and for all
whether non-INVITE messages get forked.

Any takers?

Not to argue with the basic points made, but maybe some operational
reality would help.

I think it's worth remembering that different applications have
different requirements. For example, in a PBX rebilling application,
something that's within, say, 5% accurate is going to be good enough.
For these applications, a TCP connection between proxy server and
gateway, with restricted source address trust on the gateway, is in the
"good enough" category.

Also, speaking from experience, almost all small gateways don't have the
ability to do authentication or call/packet-level accounting (and would
be significantly more expensive or complicated if they did). Thus, you
probably have a choice: spend $10k on a carrier-strength gateway or on
occasion measure a phone call wrong by a few seconds. Given the
cents/minute we're talking about, this seems like a fair trade-off.
Ideally, even simple gateways would support at least some shared-secret
authentication or IPsec.

Many hotels measure calls starting N seconds after ringing, regardless
of whether somebody picked up or not. Certainly not precise and allows
"cheating", but in the scheme of things, not one of the major problems
in the world.

If the gateway is close to the accounting proxy server, packet loss is
very unlikely.

Accounting is like voting or audio equipment: beyond a certain limit of
accuracy, costs grow exponentially and it's much better to accept that
life isn't completely fair. In real life, we don't weigh mail for
postage with the same precision as gold. Given that most calls are still
metered on a minute-by-minute basis, random errors in the sub-minute
range are not likely to be significant.

It's probably much more important to have rough alarms in place, to, for
example, catch if a call inadvertently never gets hung up or some fraud
is in progress.

In almost all cases, what matters is not the media stream, but the PSTN
signaling, since that determines the actual cost of call termination and
out-of-pocket expenses to other providers. It doesn't matter whether the
caller was talking or silent the whole time.

The problem is that once you implement "forking" at the B2B-UA level,
you also need loop detection and most of the other features and pretty
soon, you'll be back to where we started, one layer up, except that
every system will implement them differently. It may well be that
splitting them across two layers would've been the right thing, but I
doubt that the overall system would be less complex. (I agree that tags
could be avoided if the B2BUA uses, say, a new call-ID for each branch.)

Some of the complexities are due to the desire to keep proxies call
stateless. If you are willing to make them call stateful, things like
multiple 200 can probably be avoided. Again, a trade-off with some cost.

Thus, I think this is a far more complex trade-off. Without a complete
design of the alternatives, I'm afraid that we'd be deluding us in terms
of overall system complexity.

Even email has various forking problems, even though the "branches" are
completely independent, as the usual complaints about vacation emails
and confirmation receipts (think of them as multiple final responses..)
show.

I agree that for most messages (such as MESSAGE), forking-like behavior
is much more like an email reflector and should be treated as such,
invisible to the sender.

by now, it is well understood that some sort of recording of the calls made by a third party call-logging system is a requirement for many operative networks. therefore we need a way of propagating CDRs to a remote entity.
for this, we have three options available to us:
1) introduce a new type of request message.
2) use NOTIFY with CDR in the body.
3) use MESSAGE with CDR in the body.
my personaly preference will be to NOTIFY the remote call-logger.
this is the simpler part of the issue.

about authentication:
authentication of a client with the gateway is a requirement. this requirement is not necessarily for the purposes of billing. for instance, an enterprise gateway may want to provide access to only certain caller. or a personal gateway run at home over the DSL where only some are allowed to call.

at all these times, the gateway needs to authenticate the caller without any secret-sharing between them. therefore, there is a clear need for the participation of the registrar or some other authenticating service to do this.
if A calls B. B asks C is A real? C says yes because i have his secret.

while we could demand that the callers obtain their PGP keys, this is not a workable solution. we need a simple, effective solution for this within the SIP functionality (correct me if i am wrong on this).

my suggestions are like this:

1) Caller A issues an INVITE for the gateway to the proxy server.
2) proxy server challenges A, receives the correct response.
3) proxy server now proxies the INVITE to the gateway with no authentication.
4) gateway challenges the proxy. proxy responds back with the digest over the message headers, gateway password and the nonce issued by the gateway (as described in the SIP RFC).

the second scheme is completely within the SIP framework. i wonder if a stateless implementation of this scheme is possible.

Hello.
I have read draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-01.txt.
After UA received sdp with qos, UA will try to reserve network resource with RSVP.
Because RSVP do reservation with Token bucket parameters, We must know bandwidth or token bucket parameters for each codec. Where can I get more information about this?
Thanks.

Fourth choice -- use one of the many AAA protocols like AAA or DIAMETER that

> by now, it is well understood that some sort of recording of the calls
made by a third party call-logging system is a requirement for many
operative networks. therefore we need a way of propagating CDRs to a remote
entity.
> for this, we have three options available to us:
> 1) introduce a new type of request message.
> 2) use NOTIFY with CDR in the body.
> 3) use MESSAGE with CDR in the body.
> my personaly preference will be to NOTIFY the remote call-logger.

> about authentication:
> authentication of a client with the gateway is a requirement. this
requirement is not necessarily for the purposes of billing. for instance, an
enterprise gateway may want to provide access to only certain caller. or a
personal gateway run at home over the DSL where only some are allowed to
call.
>
> at all these times, the gateway needs to authenticate the caller without
any secret-sharing between them. therefore, there is a clear need for the
participation of the registrar or some other authenticating service to do
this.
> if A calls B. B asks C is A real? C says yes because i have his secret.
>
> while we could demand that the callers obtain their PGP keys, this is not
a workable solution. we need a simple, effective solution for this within
the SIP functionality (correct me if i am wrong on this).

> 2) proxy server challenges A, receives the correct response.
> 3) proxy server now proxies the INVITE to the gateway with no
authentication.
> 4) gateway challenges the proxy. proxy responds back with the digest over
the message headers, gateway password and the nonce issued by the gateway
(as described in the SIP RFC).

  Subject: RE: [SIP] Congestion control


  "but what should "proxy A"
  do if it receives other INVITE messages for proxyB, say, from UAc, within
  the period indicated in "retry-after" field?
  Should proxy-A send "503" to UAc or transfer the INVITE message
  to proxy-B even if proxy-A already has the information that proxy-B
  is in congestion?"

  Wai writes:

   >> In my implementation, proxy A still forwards the INVITE message to
proxy-B for UAc. This is so since the UA the UAc is trying  to contact might
very well be different from that of UAa. Take the example of proxy-B
forwards the request to two different PSTN gateway, one for local calls and
the other for international calls. The international all gateway might be
down but not the local call gateway.

  =====

  I concur.  Proxy A should send the INVITE anyway, as the congestion or
cause of the 503 retry condition is most likely a transient condition.
There is no way to predict in advance whether the congestion has cleared
prior to the INVITE; to assume this knowledge and allow proxy A to send a
503 is an error. thanks. /m.

I think it would be far less complex, since it doesn't impact every
silly little detail of every single extension. By making it an application
on top of the protocol, it becomes an issue for the application designer.
By and large, such a designer will be able to make reasonable decisions,
like: "I have no idea what method XYZZY means, so forking it would
be absurd."

Currently, since it is part of the spec, forking proxies will say
"XYZZY is just a method. I'm method agnostic. I'll fork it!"

I'm 100% behind Dean's proposal, and would be interested to see
how, say, a hum vote on the topic would turn out. Can we have a
short rant on this topic in London followed by a poll for rough
consensus?

Hi,

I have a simple question but I've been unable
to find an answer in the spec, FAQ, or mailing
list archives (though I may have overlooked 
something obvious).

When using the Encryption: header in a request,
is there a way for the UAS to reject the request
*and* indicate that the request was rejected because
the UAS was unable to decrypt the body? Should a
warning header be used? What about an option tag
for encryption? (i.e. is there a way to negotiate
support of encryption?) I would expect that many
implementations that don't support encryption
might return something like a 415 or a 400. 

Any comments?

The following production is in Appendix C:
	escaped = "%" hex hex

HEX is capitalized in its production.  While this is legal according to 
RFC2234, is it possible to use the same case?

I assume this is academic, but why include Appendix C instead of 
referencing RFC2234 and listing the exceptions/additions?  Why use "|" for 
alternatives instead of the "/" defined in RFC2234?

Thanks,
Chip

Of course, *that* problem could be solved by deprecating B2BUAs, which are 
truly and deeply evil IMHO....  Watching the list from afar as I do, I 
observe that there is a significant and growing temptation to fall back on 
doing everything via B2BUAs now, less and less of a discipline to force 
things into the proxy/server model, with the resulting behavior / 
architecture starting to feel more and more like Megaco.  This is a bad thing.

On the Forking topic, since I'm so far removed from true engineering, I 
thought forking *was* an application behavior, and not a part of the 
protocol.  So despite the fact that my opinion shouldn't count for much 
'cause I'm not rigorously informed or thinking as rigorously about it as I 
should, I'd probably take Adam up on his notion to keep forking at the 
application level.

Comments from an anarchist who has more of a vested interest in the edge 
than the middle....

Yes, this should be consistent.

This is annoying, but since rfc2534bis inherits definitions from RFC
2068 (HTTP/1.1), which does not quite use RFC 2234, we can either

- use RFC 2234 and remove all references in syntax to RFC 2068

- keep the | notation (and a few other modifications relative to 2234)
from RFC 2068

Beyond the / vs. |, the major difference is that RFC 2234 is a
character-oriented grammar, while SIP (and HTTP) use a word-oriented
grammar. We'd have to add a lot of LWSP everywhere in the grammar,
basically between every token, as in

Subject  =  ( "Subject" $|$ "s" ) ":" TEXT-UTF8-TRIM

becomes

Subject = ( "Subject" $|$ "s") LWSP ":" LWSP TEXT-UTF8-TRIM

and more complicated grammars become even messier. I'm not convinced
that this visual noise aids understanding, but there may be other
reasons to do this.

Ashhar,

3GPP2 is planning to use DIAMETER to capture and share such call record data
across system boundaries.  The AAA broker approach works well in this
application.  Is it necessary to re-create that entire mechanism in SIP as
well (along with proper authentication, etc.)?

Subject: [SIP] Authentication and billing through proxy/re-direct server


by now, it is well understood that some sort of recording of the calls made
by a third party call-logging system is a requirement for many operative
networks. therefore we need a way of propagating CDRs to a remote entity.
for this, we have three options available to us:
1) introduce a new type of request message.
2) use NOTIFY with CDR in the body.
3) use MESSAGE with CDR in the body.
my personaly preference will be to NOTIFY the remote call-logger.
this is the simpler part of the issue.

about authentication:
authentication of a client with the gateway is a requirement. this
requirement is not necessarily for the purposes of billing. for instance, an
enterprise gateway may want to provide access to only certain caller. or a
personal gateway run at home over the DSL where only some are allowed to
call.

at all these times, the gateway needs to authenticate the caller without any
secret-sharing between them. therefore, there is a clear need for the
participation of the registrar or some other authenticating service to do
this.
if A calls B. B asks C is A real? C says yes because i have his secret.

while we could demand that the callers obtain their PGP keys, this is not a
workable solution. we need a simple, effective solution for this within the
SIP functionality (correct me if i am wrong on this).

my suggestions are like this:

1) Caller A issues an INVITE for the gateway to the proxy server.
2) proxy server challenges A, receives the correct response.
3) proxy server now proxies the INVITE to the gateway with no
authentication.
4) gateway challenges the proxy. proxy responds back with the digest over
the message headers, gateway password and the nonce issued by the gateway
(as described in the SIP RFC).

the second scheme is completely within the SIP framework. i wonder if a
stateless implementation of this scheme is possible.

Hello. 
I have asked similar question before. But I have not received any answer. 
Draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-01.txt is saying that UA can reserve resource using RSVP. But Sdp doesn't send detail  information about reservation. Basically, RSVP requires Tspec(r,b,p,m,M) even if Controlled load service case.  SDP informs kind of codec and direction only. Because we can't know how many sample is in one IP packet from SIP or SDP,  It is hard to determine Tspec or Reservation Spec exactly.
I think that draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-01.txt or other draft must consider  this issue.
Thanks.

					Softgear.

Well just to stir the pot a little <grin> ...... isn't LWS only allowed on
the right hand side of the colon and not on the left.

>3GPP2 is planning to use DIAMETER

Other approaches at the AAA level such as using XML/SSL may be
preferable to Diameter.
Diameter would certainly make a very poor application policy server -
see <draft-gross-sipaq-01.txt >.

AAA should not be burdened with legacy from dial-up, but rather fit into
the W3C web services architecture.
What do you think?

Thanks, Henry

Mike,
That is indeed a good question. I personally like the fact of SIP and an OSP-token or some other token. Let a seperate node decide the policy and the permissions. Such a node can also be used for AAA functionality linked via DIAMETER etc. 

What SIP can do is sending an MESSAGE with additional information that is necessary for accounting, eg start time of a session and perhaps another to indicate the end-time and perhaps the selected QoS class etc. But this would be more as an addition and not to replace the current systems for AAA.

Maybe for real-time accounting? Then an operator gets an indication of the possible charges of a call and can see whether the user has enough credit on the account. And the AAA systems will sent the CDR and other acounting information at a later time.(the latter may be slow when you are a roaming mobile caller). I haven't had any time yet to look deeper into this matter.

Personally I like to get an indication of cost immediately when I place a call, it doesn't have to be 100% correct. 

But that are my own 2 cents.

Ashhar,

3GPP2 is planning to use DIAMETER to capture and share such call record data
across system boundaries.  The AAA broker approach works well in this
application.  Is it necessary to re-create that entire mechanism in SIP as
well (along with proper authentication, etc.)?

Subject: [SIP] Authentication and billing through proxy/re-direct server


by now, it is well understood that some sort of recording of the calls made
by a third party call-logging system is a requirement for many operative
networks. therefore we need a way of propagating CDRs to a remote entity.
for this, we have three options available to us:
1) introduce a new type of request message.
2) use NOTIFY with CDR in the body.
3) use MESSAGE with CDR in the body.
my personaly preference will be to NOTIFY the remote call-logger.
this is the simpler part of the issue.

about authentication:
authentication of a client with the gateway is a requirement. this
requirement is not necessarily for the purposes of billing. for instance, an
enterprise gateway may want to provide access to only certain caller. or a
personal gateway run at home over the DSL where only some are allowed to
call.

at all these times, the gateway needs to authenticate the caller without any
secret-sharing between them. therefore, there is a clear need for the
participation of the registrar or some other authenticating service to do
this.
if A calls B. B asks C is A real? C says yes because i have his secret.

while we could demand that the callers obtain their PGP keys, this is not a
workable solution. we need a simple, effective solution for this within the
SIP functionality (correct me if i am wrong on this).

my suggestions are like this:

1) Caller A issues an INVITE for the gateway to the proxy server.
2) proxy server challenges A, receives the correct response.
3) proxy server now proxies the INVITE to the gateway with no
authentication.
4) gateway challenges the proxy. proxy responds back with the digest over
the message headers, gateway password and the nonce issued by the gateway
(as described in the SIP RFC).

the second scheme is completely within the SIP framework. i wonder if a
stateless implementation of this scheme is possible.

The main motivation for this, IMO, would be that, currently, you have to do
a fairly close reading of the spec in order to determine where LWSP is
allowed.

For instance, consider (just as an example extracted from a quick browsing
of the spec):

        Timestamp  =  "Timestamp" ":" *(DIGIT) [ "." *(DIGIT) ] [ delay ]
        delay      =  *(DIGIT) [ "." *(DIGIT) ]

As I understand it, LWSP is *allowed* before and after the colon, is
*required* between the timestamp and the delay, and is *forbidden* before
and after the decimal points, and between the digits.

I think this interpretation is probably derivable from the implicit-lwsp
rules (since "." is a word character but ":" isn't) but it's very
non-obvious.

I've made some attempts at automatically generating a SIP parser from the
grammar in the spec.  The LWSP issue is by far the hardest thing to resolve.

Any way to simplify some of the tougher scenarios we have would be fine 
with me. I think we should at least discuss your proposal in London, either

FWIW, I'll volunteer to do this if we think it's really worth it.
Proofing it will take more work than editing, for sure.
I'd rather edit than proof :)

I agree; this is a problem shared across these types of grammars. RFC
2822 (the successor to RFC 822) tries to be more rigorous and now calls
out LWS and FLWS explicitly.

I'll volunteer to help out if there is an interest.
Of course the problem is not to break existing syntax.

Hi,

One more question on the same line.

Response-Key header ( Section 6:37 in bis02) in a request from UAC to
UAS tells what encryption an UAS should use to encrypt the response. If
UAS can't code, 420 response is sent back to UAC.

What to be done when an UAC wished to send in encrypted way a request to
UAS?
Is this negotiation mechanism possible in SIP?

Please give back your opinion if I missed any major concepts.

Regards,
Varadarajan

Bridging and conferencing problems are not sufficient justification for the 
profusion of B2BUAs.  Most endpoints I know (hard/soft phones, gateways) 
have enough signal/host processing power to mix 3-4 RTP streams.

So to effect a conference, you *can* work out call flows that let the 
endpoint bridge a small number of streams.  (We have done this just fine, 
thank you.)

This clearly doesn't scale.  But since most conferences are small anyway, 
the only products that *MUST* use B2BUAs to do this would be big, honkin 
network-based conference bridges for large conferences.  This is *not* who 
seems to be falling back on B2BUAs.  Instead, it is everybody who started 
out by building a simple proxy/redirect/registry server.

Endpoint bridging also uses slightly more bandwidth.  But we should not 
make the protocol design a slave to today's bandwidth constraints.

Conferencing itself is not sufficient justification for the predominance of 
B2BUAs.  The primary reason so many vendors seem to be falling back on 
B2BUAs is that they don't *MAKE* endpoints -- just servers.  The B2BUA is a 
convenient crutch to get more direct control over a component that is 
foreign to their solution.  Cooperate -- don't compete -- for better control.

Of course, I would agree that it is crucially important that clients remain 
clients.  But servers should not become clients, too.  It's a bad idea.

To be clear, I was not being particularly serious about trying to 
"depricate" them from the standard.  Clearly, they *are* a valid UA, and 
can be used as such.  But the industry should think hard about the clear 
DOWNSIDE to falling back on a B2BUA to solve every problem.  Thus, my 
modestly-offered podium-speech.

Comments again from the marginally qualified, but somewhat religious, gallery.

Perhaps I don't fully understand the terminology - I don't recall ever
seeing a precise definition of a B2BUA. But it seems to me that an
endpoint that is managing a conference *is* acting as a B2BUA. If so,
then it seems you are objecting to a certain class of B2BUA.

Well, "some quarters" includes me, at least (maybe only me, but I hope not
:) ).

The reason its in the spec is, as Henning has pointed out, to avoid the
propagation of call state into the network. SIP was designed, first and
foremost, as a rendezvous type of protocol that could find a user at a
multitude of locations, and connect the caller to the called party across
different devices. In its role as a user discovery and connection protocol,
supporting the ability to reach a user at several devices is a big
reuqirement. Since we were also in the business of designing Internet
protocols, we wanted to push state to the edges, so that one could build a
system to do basic functions without all this cruft in the middle of the
network. Indeed, Jay has raised the flag on that in a separate note on this
thread. Removing forking from SIP means more of those B2BUAs. Lots more, I
think (in fact, pretty much all proxies will turn into B2BUAs as a default
mode). So, given its there already, I'd rather keep it, and instead, do a
far better job of explaining it in the spec. Its not really THAT hard, its
just that the spec is not exactly lucid on this, and many other, topics.

Now, back to the original question: to fork, or not-to-fork, non-INVITEs. I
agree with Christian, and I think there is consensus on this, that forking
of a non-INVITE only makes sense if (1) that request establishes no state at
the UASes, and the set of servers that are reached are homogeneous, so that
a response from any are equivalent, or (2) a 3-way handshake can be created
in some other way, specific to the method. Now, I think its fair to say that
the usefulness of a method that meets (1) is not too high, and worse, we
can't guarantee this property for all methods. So, indeed, the question is
whether we feel its useful to define, on a method by method basis (or
perhaps there is a general purpose solution lurking somehwhere?), a
three-way handshake to deal with forked non-INVITE.

But, if its something that has to be done on a method-by-method basis,
perhaps that belongs in the application space, using a B2BUA. Now, maybe
this is contradicting myself, since I just argued above that forking of
INVITE belongs in the protocol, and not in the application space. But,
forking of these non-INVITEs is presumably a much less common ocurrence, so
that putting it in the application space is not as much a burden.

I'll be sure to put this topic on my running open-issues list for London.

Folks,

While we're on the subject of modest proposals, here is another that I've
been toying with:

  Change the definition of call-leg ID. Instead of To, To-tag, From,
  From-tag, and Call-ID, its *only* the tags and the Call-ID. That is,
  the ID no longer contains the URLs.

There are quite a few benefits from this:

1. A calls B, and its forwarded to C. C accepts, and later re-INVITEs. The
From field in this re-INVITE is NOT actually the identity of C, but rather,
B. This screws up the idempotency of SIP INVITE. The From field has one
meaning in INVITE, and another in re-INVITE. This makes defining policies
based on the From field more complex, since they no longer work properly for
re-INVITE. 

2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since the tags and
call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive string compares.
Much easier than URL comparison. 

3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send each digit as a
new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the request URI.
By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that
within a single call leg. Much cleaner.

4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the
Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being replaced. This
gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can
throw away the URLs. This shortens the header and makes matching of the
call-leg IDs easier.

5. It works with existing proxies.

THe main drawback, of course, is that this won't interoperate with rfc2543
UAs. Thats fixable with Supported; the UAC indicates Supported:
new-call-leg-id in the INVITE if it understands this. In that case, any
responses or re-invites that change the URLs include a Require:
new-call-leg-id. 

I fully admit that this may not be worth the pain. However, I'd welcome
comments from others on whether its useful to consider further.

-Jonathan R.

The main reason for B2BUA is to take control over the service to be provided to the end user.
So, if SIP is strictly used as a "rendez-vous" protocol over the public Best Effort Internet network, there is in principle no need for such functionality.
This can become quite different if you need to handle the user plane, as in the case of conference controllers.
This is still worse if you are intended to provide services having guaranteed characteristics, like confidentiality, QoS, roaming, etc. A simple SIP proxy can not provide that, then you need a more complex functionality (because the service is more
complex) allowing you to take control over the user request, and that can be done with B2BUA servers.
Best regards
Juan Carlos

Perhaps I don't fully understand the terminology - I don't recall ever
seeing a precise definition of a B2BUA. But it seems to me that an
endpoint that is managing a conference *is* acting as a B2BUA. If so,
then it seems you are objecting to a certain class of B2BUA.

Hi,

Still on bis-03, section B.4.1
"New media sections MUST appear below any existing media sessions". OK, that's very clear.

But the example given in section B.5 shows that the new media ("m=audio 8864 RTP/AVP 110") is added *before* the existing media.
Shouldn't it be corrected ?

Best regards

     Juan Carlos

Hi Jonathan,

I think this is a very interesting proposal that solves a few problems,
makes many things _much_ easier to implement and potentially more CPU
efficient - definitely a modest proposal worth considering.

I do however think that selection of the To & From tags must be done with
more care  if this suggestion is adopted (ie space & time uniqueness of tags
is more crucial). For instance, the UAS MUST always choose a To tag that is
different to the From tag so that the message direction can be determined.
Of course, if tags are chosen to be properly globally unique across space &
time (as they should be) then this is not a problem. 

Regards,

Robert.

Hi Henning,

Hmmm.... you are of course correct. However I think that bis-03 is worded
rather deceptively. It explicitly says that the name is followed by a colon
and that white space MAY then be used after the colon (inferring it is not
allowed beforehand otherwise why would only one-side be mentioned?).

---
Section 10.5 Header Field Format

Header fields ("general-header", "request-header", "response-header", and
"entity-header") follow the same generic header format as that given in
Section 3.1 of RFC 822 [25]. Each header field consists of a name followed
by a colon (":") and the field value. Field names are case-insensitive. The
field value MAY be preceded by any amount of leading white space (LWS),
though a single space (SP) is preferred.

Robert.

UAs (and B2B UAs) make sense when the UA also needs to terminate media,
as for large-scale conference bridges and anonymizers. I don't think
anybody is arguing with that, although for conference bridges, one would
hope that they are transient phenomena. (Despite the bad press,
multicast is slowly emerging as an option again, at least in selected
environments, such as Internet2.)

I have no idea why you would need B2B UAs for roaming or what they have
to do with QoS (except that they generally are likely to make QoS
worse.)

An additional use of B2BUAs is for media translation, but this is really
only likely for multiparty calls, as quality is much better if you can
avoid transcoding. (I may be underestimating the effect of the screwy
licensing for G.72x and various other low-rate codecs here, which also
could lead to more transcoding than is technically called for.)

I love it. It's clean. Its neat.

I haven't thought this part out, but couldn't you also then
let proxies along the path replace the To header with normalized
addresses? Could this be part of a possible solution to our
"who called me?" problem with applications?

hello,

ETSI/3GPP, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); QoS Concept and Architecture (3GPP TS 23.107 version 3.5.0 Release 1999), ETSI TS 123 107 v3.5.0, http://webapp.etsi.org/pda/home.asp?wki_id=12899

shows a few types of QoS, streaming, conversational, etc
the problem is that I am unsure how this ends up in SIP?

PINT2.0 does give SDP extensions to what type of media stream is used and thus the QoS requirement linked to it but only for VOICE.

Will there be in SIP or SDP an indication if it has to be streaming or e.g conversational (which allows for less delay then streaming that can be buffered)?

I appreciate the help.

cheers

Arnoud van Wijk

This would only be needed in those cases where the UAC violates the
existing definition of call legs, which are presumably rare (overlap
dialing, possibly). All the other cases, such as call forwarding to C
and then INVITEs to C, are more corner cases that work oddly right now.

I think it would be worth considering if we can avoid the proliferation
of new identifiers and can spell out the cases where existing things
break.

This is a very good idea, IMHO. We have been struggling to find a
cleaner solution to some of the issues Jonathan mentions and additional
scenarios where it is difficult to preserve all elements of call-leg ID
as presently defined. In the long run, cleaning this up helps SIP
interoperability, so I think this is worth doing.  Is it too late to
include this in the bis draft?

Subject: [Sip] another modest proposal: change call-leg ID


Folks,

While we're on the subject of modest proposals, here is another that
I've
been toying with:

  Change the definition of call-leg ID. Instead of To, To-tag, From,
  From-tag, and Call-ID, its *only* the tags and the Call-ID. That is,
  the ID no longer contains the URLs.

There are quite a few benefits from this:

1. A calls B, and its forwarded to C. C accepts, and later re-INVITEs.
The
From field in this re-INVITE is NOT actually the identity of C, but
rather,
B. This screws up the idempotency of SIP INVITE. The From field has one
meaning in INVITE, and another in re-INVITE. This makes defining
policies
based on the From field more complex, since they no longer work properly
for
re-INVITE.=20

2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since the tags
and
call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive string
compares.
Much easier than URL comparison.=20

3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send each digit as
a
new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the request
URI.
By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that
within a single call leg. Much cleaner.

4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the
Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being replaced.
This
gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can
throw away the URLs. This shortens the header and makes matching of the
call-leg IDs easier.

5. It works with existing proxies.

THe main drawback, of course, is that this won't interoperate with
rfc2543
UAs. Thats fixable with Supported; the UAC indicates Supported:
new-call-leg-id in the INVITE if it understands this. In that case, any
responses or re-invites that change the URLs include a Require:
new-call-leg-id.=20

I fully admit that this may not be worth the pain. However, I'd welcome
comments from others on whether its useful to consider further.

-Jonathan R.

But this proposal only removes information from the call leg ID,
which can't help you with this policy problem. You certainly
won't define policies based on tags. I agree this is 
definitely a problem, but I don't think this is a solution.
There are also cases where you want to be able to identify a
session as being transferred -- having the original A/B parties
is a nice thing to have.

True. Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if the To:/From: were
immutable -- a modest proposal of my own :).

Does this mean a gateway will have to generate a new tag for
each endpoint it supports?

The replaces problem is simpler. You are talking about a pre-existing
call leg. This makes matching simpler and therefore the proposal of
using only the tags in this case is a reasonable one. The real
problem with using only tags is the *possibility* for clashes -- are
tags sufficiently unique? For Replaces:, I feel comfortable saying yes.
For the more general case, I'm not sure I do.

What about the overlapped dialing case?

Does this have any impacts on the ways in which UAs allocate
tags? (esp. across restarts?)

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;re-INVITE. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>But this proposal only removes information from the call leg ID,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>which can't help you with this policy problem. You certainly</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>won't define policies based on tags. I agree this is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>definitely a problem, but I don't think this is a solution.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>There are also cases where you want to be able to identify a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>session as being transferred -- having the original A/B parties</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>is a nice thing to have.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;the tags and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;string compares.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;Much easier than URL comparison.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>True. Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if the To:/From: were</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>immutable -- a modest proposal of my own :).</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;each digit as a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;request URI.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;within a single call leg. Much cleaner.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Does this mean a gateway will have to generate a new tag for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>each endpoint it supports? </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;replaced. This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;throw away the URLs. This shortens the header and makes matching of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;call-leg IDs easier.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The replaces problem is simpler. You are talking about a pre-existing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>call leg. This makes matching simpler and therefore the proposal of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>using only the tags in this case is a reasonable one. The real</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>problem with using only tags is the *possibility* for clashes -- are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>tags sufficiently unique? For Replaces:, I feel comfortable saying yes.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>For the more general case, I'm not sure I do.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;5. It works with existing proxies.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>What about the overlapped dialing case?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;THe main drawback, of course, is that this won't interoperate </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;with rfc2543</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;UAs. Thats fixable with Supported; the UAC indicates Supported:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;new-call-leg-id in the INVITE if it understands this. In that case, any</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;responses or re-invites that change the URLs include a Require:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;new-call-leg-id. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;I fully admit that this may not be worth the pain. However, I'd welcome</FONT>

It is very tempting to depreciate forking altogether, especially when
one considers just how many value-added capabilities will have to be
implemented with B2BUA capabilities (forking with automatic bridging,
for instance). Simplifying the protocol here might be a very good thing,
but only if we can address the loop detection issue.

My own feeling is that keeping forking as it exists today isn't going to
result in fewer B2BUA implementations because of the value-add
temptation. If we're going to have looping, why not come up with a
scheme that works equally well with forking proxies and forked bridging
B2BUAs and other flavors still to be created?

What is the minimum amount of information required for loop detection?
Could we accomplish this by using a unique endpoint identifier like a
MAC address (although a large scale or applications UA might need to
append a tag to separate unique sub-entities for which it terminates
calls)?=20

I believe there is a lot of value in providing for higher-level loop
detection regardless of our decision on forking. The real question is
whether standardized, higher-level loop detection is realistic or
feasible.

I think it would be far less complex, since it doesn't impact every
silly little detail of every single extension. By making it an
application
on top of the protocol, it becomes an issue for the application
designer.
By and large, such a designer will be able to make reasonable decisions,
like: "I have no idea what method XYZZY means, so forking it would
be absurd."

Currently, since it is part of the spec, forking proxies will say
"XYZZY is just a method. I'm method agnostic. I'll fork it!"

I'm 100% behind Dean's proposal, and would be interested to see
how, say, a hum vote on the topic would turn out. Can we have a
short rant on this topic in London followed by a poll for rough
consensus?

This draft describes how a MEGACO controlled RTP proxy can be used
to provide firewall traversal for media flows for SIP calls. The
MEGACO profile described in this draft can be used to support any
UDP flow.

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

The cost of B2BUA's is introducing a lot more
brittleness into the network. Sometimes this is
unavoidable, but when it isn't it shouldn't be
encouraged. The second line of defense here, IMO,
would be to just fail back to the UAC with lists
of candidates and let it sift through the
resulting graph.

<font size=3D3>Jonathan,<br>
<br>
If you really want to push the call state to the edge, then there should
be forking redirect servers, not proxies.&nbsp; If forking is needed, the
associated information should be sent back to the UAC and let it do the
forking of requests and handling responses.&nbsp; Some of the previous
discussion indicates ambiguity over whether the forking proxy is handling
the transaction responses or the UAC.&nbsp; Doesn't seem clean to
me.<br>
<br>
The reason for the forking is service related, not session setup related
and as such you open pandoras box to other service-related
&quot;cruft&quot; being introduced to the base protocol.&nbsp; It seems
that the main advance of SIP over legacy protocols was that adherence to
general purpose mechanisms that are not service specific.&nbsp; Where the
legacy systems made a distinction between basic call setup and
supplementary services, they did not keep the protocol elements
associated with each separate.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Now, it appears that SIP has addressed the basic session setup elements
and is facing the same issues of how to do more advance services as
before.&nbsp; Question is, do you start adding protocol elements that are
needed by only certain classes of services?&nbsp; After that, when do you
stop?&nbsp; Is there another way to handle service-specific data that is
peculiar to an application (e.g. supplementary service) but not general
to all sessions?<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; Well, I've made the less modest proposal before that forking could
be<br>
&gt; removed entirely from the specification. It seems to be an
unpopular<br>
&gt; suggestion in some quarters, but I like to bring it up before <br>
&gt; IETF meetings<br>
&gt; as a matter of tradition (and in hopes that someday certain <br>
&gt; critical parties<br>
&gt; will agree).<br>
<br>
Well, &quot;some quarters&quot; includes me, at least (maybe only me, but
I hope not<br>
:) ).<br>
<br>
The reason its in the spec is, as Henning has pointed out, to avoid
the<br>
propagation of call state into the network. SIP was designed, first
and<br>
foremost, as a rendezvous type of protocol that could find a user at
a<br>
multitude of locations, and connect the caller to the called party
across<br>
different devices. In its role as a user discovery and connection
protocol,<br>
supporting the ability to reach a user at several devices is a big<br>
reuqirement. Since we were also in the business of designing
Internet<br>
protocols, we wanted to push state to the edges, so that one could build
a<br>
system to do basic functions without all this cruft in the middle of
the<br>
network. Indeed, Jay has raised the flag on that in a separate note on
this<br>
thread. Removing forking from SIP means more of those B2BUAs. Lots more,
I<br>
think (in fact, pretty much all proxies will turn into B2BUAs as a
default<br>
mode). So, given its there already, I'd rather keep it, and instead, do
a<br>
far better job of explaining it in the spec. Its not really THAT hard,
its<br>
just that the spec is not exactly lucid on this, and many other,
topics.<br>
<br>
Now, back to the original question: to fork, or not-to-fork, non-INVITEs.
I<br>
agree with Christian, and I think there is consensus on this, that
forking<br>
of a non-INVITE only makes sense if (1) that request establishes no state
at<br>
the UASes, and the set of servers that are reached are homogeneous, so
that<br>
a response from any are equivalent, or (2) a 3-way handshake can be
created<br>
in some other way, specific to the method. Now, I think its fair to say
that<br>
the usefulness of a method that meets (1) is not too high, and worse,
we<br>
can't guarantee this property for all methods. So, indeed, the question
is<br>
whether we feel its useful to define, on a method by method basis
(or<br>
perhaps there is a general purpose solution lurking somehwhere?), a<br>
three-way handshake to deal with forked non-INVITE.<br>
<br>
But, if its something that has to be done on a method-by-method
basis,<br>
perhaps that belongs in the application space, using a B2BUA. Now,
maybe<br>
this is contradicting myself, since I just argued above that forking
of<br>
INVITE belongs in the protocol, and not in the application space.
But,<br>
forking of these non-INVITEs is presumably a much less common ocurrence,
so<br>
that putting it in the application space is not as much a burden.<br>
<br>
I'll be sure to put this topic on my running open-issues list for
London.<br>

Would your proposal in any way enable a rogue endpoint to alter or take
over a session by replicating a valid set of Call-ID and tags?=20

Subject: [Sip] another modest proposal: change call-leg ID


Folks,

While we're on the subject of modest proposals, here is another that
I've
been toying with:

  Change the definition of call-leg ID. Instead of To, To-tag, From,
  From-tag, and Call-ID, its *only* the tags and the Call-ID. That is,
  the ID no longer contains the URLs.

There are quite a few benefits from this:

1. A calls B, and its forwarded to C. C accepts, and later re-INVITEs.
The
From field in this re-INVITE is NOT actually the identity of C, but
rather,
B. This screws up the idempotency of SIP INVITE. The From field has one
meaning in INVITE, and another in re-INVITE. This makes defining
policies
based on the From field more complex, since they no longer work properly
for
re-INVITE.=20

2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since the tags
and
call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive string
compares.
Much easier than URL comparison.=20

3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send each digit as
a
new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the request
URI.
By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that
within a single call leg. Much cleaner.

4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the
Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being replaced.
This
gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can
throw away the URLs. This shortens the header and makes matching of the
call-leg IDs easier.

5. It works with existing proxies.

THe main drawback, of course, is that this won't interoperate with
rfc2543
UAs. Thats fixable with Supported; the UAC indicates Supported:
new-call-leg-id in the INVITE if it understands this. In that case, any
responses or re-invites that change the URLs include a Require:
new-call-leg-id.=20

I fully admit that this may not be worth the pain. However, I'd welcome
comments from others on whether its useful to consider further.

-Jonathan R.

Right. Note that Call-ID is already supposed to be globally unique, which
helps. Choosing unique tags across space and time would also generally be
useful for other purposes.

I think this is an excellent proposal. I support this.

While we are at it I would like to make another proposal, kind of related.
Currently call-ids unnecessarily contain the IP address of the client.
This gets into the way of hiding information in case of firewall
traversal. One easy way would be to md5 this or some function
that keeps the uniqueness of callid.

While I don't disagree with your time-and-place
kind of argument re PBX's, etc, there's a fairly
trivial scenario which doesn't involve the PSTN
that could lead to QoS fraud with untrustworthy
cooperating UA's. The DQoS/media authorization
draft talks about this ad-nauseum, but the basic
point is that if you don't have some sort of choke
on the media, then you're pretty wide open to
people sending a BYE to the signaling
intermediaries while happily honoring an
X-Not-Really end to end.

<font size=2>Folks,</font> <br><br>
<font size=2>While we're on the subject of modest proposals, here is another that I've</font> <br>
<font size=2>been toying with:</font> <br><br>
<font size=2>&nbsp; Change the definition of call-leg ID. Instead of To, To-tag, From,</font> <br>
<font size=2>&nbsp; From-tag, and Call-ID, its *only* the tags and the Call-ID. That is,</font> <br>
<font size=2>&nbsp; the ID no longer contains the URLs.</font> <br><br>
<font size=2>There are quite a few benefits from this:</font> <br><br>
<font size=2>1. A calls B, and its forwarded to C. C accepts, and later re-INVITEs. The</font> <br>
<font size=2>From field in this re-INVITE is NOT actually the identity of C, but rather,</font> <br>
<font size=2>B. This screws up the idempotency of SIP INVITE. The &gt;From field has one</font> <br>
<font size=2>meaning in INVITE, and another in re-INVITE. This makes defining policies</font> <br>
<font size=2>based on the From field more complex, since they no longer work properly for</font> <br>
<font size=2>re-INVITE. <br>
</font><br>
<font size=2>2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since the tags and</font> <br>
<font size=2>call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive string compares.</font> <br>
<font size=2>Much easier than URL comparison. <br>
</font><br>
<font size=2>3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send each digit as a</font> <br>
<font size=2>new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the request URI.</font> <br>
<font size=2>By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that</font> <br>
<font size=2>within a single call leg. Much cleaner.</font> <br><br>
<font size=2>4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the</font> <br>
<font size=2>Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being replaced. This</font> <br>
<font size=2>gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can</font> <br>

Sort of. Wireless-to-landline calls go through a GSM-to-G.711
transcoder; most wireless-to-wireless calls go GSM-to-G.711-to-GSM.
(Substitute various other heavily-compressed codecs for "GSM" to
make the above sentence apply all over the world).

Since the audio characteristics of most phones is so crappy, and
since an 8 kHz sampling rate is rather dismal, most people don't
even notice.

Three letters: AMR

3GPP is going for AMR as a default codec, with the implication that
G.711 *will* *not* be used.

Bakeoffs have shown that many firmware SIP implementations use
G.711 exclusively.

In the short term, transcoders will abound.

This is why (I feel) we need to come up with a good architecture
to support transcoding which doesn't require a B2BUA. No, I'm not
proposing a work item (we do protocols, not architectures); I'm
just thinking out loud.

Very thoughtful response, Michael.

I find it interesting that server companies aren't making much more 
extensive use of redirect.  It scales well, it keeps (potentially 
unnecessary) servers out of a long list of Route-Recorded waystations that 
delay message delivery.  Etc.

I suspect it is because of business issues, not technical issues.  If one 
is building a server, one needs insure that the server adds lots of value 
and stays "in the loop" sufficiently in order that that server pulls in 
enough revenue....

Especially if you don't make clients/UAs as well.  Which is why folks like 
Sylantro, Broadsoft, and others (whom I'm not letting see this by virtue of 
*not* copying the list) are basically *not* implementing even Proxies, but 
full, big-honkin B2BUAs as their core architecture (I think).

There is, in the product world, a deep temptation to be in the control loop 
wherever possible -- vs. wherever necessary....

Cheers

&gt; Well, I've made the less modest proposal before that forking could
be<br>
&gt; removed entirely from the specification. It seems to be an
unpopular<br>
&gt; suggestion in some quarters, but I like to bring it up before <br>
&gt; IETF meetings<br>
&gt; as a matter of tradition (and in hopes that someday certain <br>
&gt; critical parties<br>
&gt; will agree).<br><br>
Well, &quot;some quarters&quot; includes me, at least (maybe only me, but
I hope not<br>
:) ).<br><br>
The reason its in the spec is, as Henning has pointed out, to avoid
the<br>
propagation of call state into the network. SIP was designed, first
and<br>
foremost, as a rendezvous type of protocol that could find a user at
a<br>
multitude of locations, and connect the caller to the called party
across<br>
different devices. In its role as a user discovery and connection
protocol,<br>
supporting the ability to reach a user at several devices is a big<br>
reuqirement. Since we were also in the business of designing
Internet<br>
protocols, we wanted to push state to the edges, so that one could build
a<br>
system to do basic functions without all this cruft in the middle of
the<br>
network. Indeed, Jay has raised the flag on that in a separate note on
this<br>
thread. Removing forking from SIP means more of those B2BUAs. Lots more,
I<br>
think (in fact, pretty much all proxies will turn into B2BUAs as a
default<br>
mode). So, given its there already, I'd rather keep it, and instead, do
a<br>
far better job of explaining it in the spec. Its not really THAT hard,
its<br>
just that the spec is not exactly lucid on this, and many other,
topics.<br><br>
Now, back to the original question: to fork, or not-to-fork, non-INVITEs.
I<br>
agree with Christian, and I think there is consensus on this, that
forking<br>
of a non-INVITE only makes sense if (1) that request establishes no state
at<br>
the UASes, and the set of servers that are reached are homogeneous, so
that<br>
a response from any are equivalent, or (2) a 3-way handshake can be
created<br>
in some other way, specific to the method. Now, I think its fair to say
that<br>
the usefulness of a method that meets (1) is not too high, and worse,
we<br>
can't guarantee this property for all methods. So, indeed, the question
is<br>
whether we feel its useful to define, on a method by method basis
(or<br>
perhaps there is a general purpose solution lurking somehwhere?), a<br>
three-way handshake to deal with forked non-INVITE.<br><br>
But, if its something that has to be done on a method-by-method
basis,<br>
perhaps that belongs in the application space, using a B2BUA. Now,
maybe<br>
this is contradicting myself, since I just argued above that forking
of<br>
INVITE belongs in the protocol, and not in the application space.
But,<br>
forking of these non-INVITEs is presumably a much less common ocurrence,

My .02 on this is that we should aim, as much as possible
for DESTINATION TRANSCODING.  There are other names for this.

Basically, in means that the end device, whatever it may be
should, in as many cases as possible, accept whatever
may be thrown at it, and convert it ONCE to whatever it
needs to.  This allows, for example, a mobile-to-mobile
call to have zero to one transcode stages, and not require
<whatever>-711-<whatever>.

Of course you can never enforce this, and you have to
allow for transcoders in the middle, but it really 
makes the quality go down fast to have two transcoding
stages.  The thing to remember is that intermediate
steps often don't know what the REAL destination coder is,
they tend to only know the coder at the edge of their own
domain.

Shiv,

Please reread bis-03. UA's concerned about revealing their identity are not
required to include their address. 

bis-3 says abotu Call-ID:

---

callid = token [ "@" token ]
Call-ID = ( "Call-ID" j "i" ) ":" callid

The callid MUST be a globally unique identifier and MUST NOT be reused for
later calls. Use of crypto-graphically random identifiers [28] is
RECOMMENDED. Implementations MAY use the form "localid@host". Call-IDs are
case-sensitive and are simply compared byte-by-byte.

---

Robert.

I think people can always build rogue endpoints or proxies but as far as I
can see this proposal doesn't change the "security" situation. If the rogue
entity can change/replicate the tag value then it could just as easily
change/replicate the whole URL (and vice versa). Additionally if
authentication is employed then the tag is just as protected as the whole
URL (since it is a subset).
 
It does however raise the point that if a message is signed then an
intermediate proxy may not modify the rest of the URL (while maintaining the
same tag value) but I think this is a desirable rather than undesirable
property. [Just as a proxy may not currently change the display name on a
signed message even though this does not affect the call-leg id.]
 
Cheers,

Robert.

Subject: [Sip] another modest proposal: change call-leg ID 

Folks, 

While we're on the subject of modest proposals, here is another that I've 
been toying with: 

  Change the definition of call-leg ID. Instead of To, To-tag, From, 
  From-tag, and Call-ID, its *only* the tags and the Call-ID. That is, 
  the ID no longer contains the URLs. 

There are quite a few benefits from this: 

1. A calls B, and its forwarded to C. C accepts, and later re-INVITEs. The 
From field in this re-INVITE is NOT actually the identity of C, but rather, 
B. This screws up the idempotency of SIP INVITE. The >From field has one 
meaning in INVITE, and another in re-INVITE. This makes defining policies 
based on the From field more complex, since they no longer work properly for

re-INVITE. 

2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since the tags and 
call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive string compares. 
Much easier than URL comparison. 

3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send each digit as a 
new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the request URI. 
By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that 
within a single call leg. Much cleaner. 

4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the 
Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being replaced. This 
gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can 
throw away the URLs. This shortens the header and makes matching of the 
call-leg IDs easier. 

5. It works with existing proxies. 

THe main drawback, of course, is that this won't interoperate with rfc2543 
UAs. Thats fixable with Supported; the UAC indicates Supported: 
new-call-leg-id in the INVITE if it understands this. In that case, any 
responses or re-invites that change the URLs include a Require: 
new-call-leg-id. 

I fully admit that this may not be worth the pain. However, I'd welcome 
comments from others on whether its useful to consider further. 

-Jonathan R.

Yeah, yeah -- you never stir the pot just for the sake of it, Jay. :)

To address Andrew's question: it is completely unclear how this would
allow hijacking of a call any more than the previous schemes did.
If a system is set up in a way that is so brittle as to allow the
call to be taken over with just tags, that same system will have an
identical problem under the current scheme, in which it could be hijacked
using tags and URIs.

Or I could be missing something. Outline a hypothetical situation
in which a call could be hijacked under the scheme Jonathan
proposes, but in such a way that is not currently possible.

1. A calls B, and its forwarded to C. C accepts, and later re-INVITEs. The
From field in this re-INVITE is NOT actually the identity of C, but rather,
B. This screws up the idempotency of SIP INVITE. The >From field has one
meaning in INVITE, and another in re-INVITE. This makes defining policies
based on the From field more complex, since they no longer work properly for
re-INVITE.

2. call-leg ID lookups in gateways are much faster now, since the tags and
call-ids are just strings. Matching is now case-sensitive string compares.
Much easier than URL comparison.

3. Overlap dialing is easier. The reason we've had to send each digit as a
new call leg, is that we needed to change the To field and the request URI.
By definition, this meant a new call leg. Now, we can send all of that
within a single call leg. Much cleaner.

4. The Replaces draft benefits. We've already identified a need for the
Replaces header to identify the entire call leg thats being replaced. This
gets big when it carries two URLs, two tags, and a call-id. Now, we can
throw away the URLs. This shortens the header and makes matching of the
call-leg IDs easier.

5. It works with existing proxies.

THe main drawback, of course, is that this won't interoperate with rfc2543
UAs. Thats fixable with Supported; the UAC indicates Supported:
new-call-leg-id in the INVITE if it understands this. In that case, any
responses or re-invites that change the URLs include a Require:
new-call-leg-id.

I fully admit that this may not be worth the pain. However, I'd welcome
comments from others on whether its useful to consider further.

On IP, transcoding is best accomplished as you describe.

I think you missed my point, though: I was illustrating
the fact that an absurd amount of transcoding goes on currently,
and that it doesn't really hurt because phones sound crappy to
start with. People put up with transcoding, and cannot usually
tell the difference.

The single codec conversion of which you speak is what I'm referring
to when I say that we need a good, non-B2BUA solution for transcoding.

To summarize what I was trying to say: transcoders will be present.
They should not break the signaling. We need to make this happen.

Well, that email wasn't, in fact, actually intended to go to the list.  In 
fact, it was plain and simple bad form to *NOT* make my comments publicly 
in the first place, vs. making them instead in a private email.  For this I 
dutifully suck up to, and offer my apologies to our buddies at Broadsoft 
and Sylantro.

Despite this, I stand by my observations on the use of B2BUAs, redirect 
servers, etc. in my prior email.  I know that, as far as I am concerned, I 
don what little bit of Engineering Hat I have left to me when I contribute 
to this forum.  In that role, I use the list to speak my mind -- without 
particular regard to how it might sound to our partners.

I simply remind our partners to remember that I *do* wear a different hat 
-- a business / strategic relationship hat.  And in that role, I remain 
fully committed to cause Pingtel to work hard to grow this market with 
*all* SIP product vendors -- technical differences aside.

On a continuing basis, though, I trust that all of us -- myself included -- 
can feel free to make use of this kind of forum to have healthy 
disagreements about things *on the way to* working together.

Cheers

&gt; unnecessary) servers out of a long list of Route-Recorded
waystations<br>
&gt; that delay message delivery.&nbsp; Etc.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I suspect it is because of business issues, not technical
issues.&nbsp; If<br>
&gt; one is building a server, one needs insure that the server adds
lots<br>
&gt; of value and stays &quot;in the loop&quot; sufficiently in order
that that<br>
&gt; server pulls in enough revenue....<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Especially if you don't make clients/UAs as well.&nbsp; Which is why
folks<br>
&gt; like Sylantro, Broadsoft, and others (whom I'm not letting see this
by<br><br>
Actually, you did copy sip@ietf.org - unless this was meant as a
joke...<br><br>
<br>
&gt; virtue of *not* copying the list) are basically *not*
implementing<br>
&gt; even Proxies, but full, big-honkin B2BUAs as their core
architecture<br>
&gt; (I think).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There is, in the product world, a deep temptation to be in the
control<br>
&gt; loop wherever possible -- vs. wherever necessary....<br>

&gt; &gt; If you really want to push the call state to the edge, then
there<br>
&gt; &gt; should be forking redirect servers, not proxies.&nbsp; If
forking is<br>
&gt; &gt; needed, the associated information should be sent back to the
UAC<br>
&gt; &gt; and let it do the forking of requests and handling
responses.&nbsp; Some<br>
&gt; &gt; of the previous discussion indicates ambiguity over whether
the<br>
&gt; &gt; forking proxy is handling the transaction responses or the
UAC.<br>
&gt; &gt; Doesn't seem clean to me.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The reason for the forking is service related, not session
setup<br>
&gt; &gt; related and as such you open pandoras box to other
service-related<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;cruft&quot; being introduced to the base protocol.&nbsp;
It seems that the<br>
&gt; &gt; main advance of SIP over legacy protocols was that adherence
to<br>
&gt; &gt; general purpose mechanisms that are not service specific.&nbsp;
Where the<br>
&gt; &gt; legacy systems made a distinction between basic call setup
and<br>
&gt; &gt; supplementary services, they did not keep the protocol
elements<br>
&gt; &gt; associated with each separate.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Now, it appears that SIP has addressed the basic session
setup<br>
&gt; &gt; elements and is facing the same issues of how to do more
advance<br>
&gt; &gt; services as before.&nbsp; Question is, do you start adding
protocol<br>
&gt; &gt; elements that are needed by only certain classes of
services?&nbsp; After<br>
&gt; &gt; that, when do you stop?&nbsp; Is there another way to
handle<br>
&gt; &gt; service-specific data that is peculiar to an application
(e.g.<br>
&gt; &gt; supplementary service) but not general to all sessions?<br>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I've made the less modest proposal before that
forking<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; could be<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; removed entirely from the specification. It seems to
be an<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; unpopular<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; suggestion in some quarters, but I like to bring it up
before<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; IETF meetings<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as a matter of tradition (and in hopes that someday
certain<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; critical parties<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will agree).<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, &quot;some quarters&quot; includes me, at least
(maybe only me, but I<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hope not<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; :) ).<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The reason its in the spec is, as Henning has pointed out,
to<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; avoid the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; propagation of call state into the network. SIP was
designed,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; first and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; foremost, as a rendezvous type of protocol that could find
a user<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; at a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; multitude of locations, and connect the caller to the
called party<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; across<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; different devices. In its role as a user discovery and
connection<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; protocol,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; supporting the ability to reach a user at several devices
is a big<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; reuqirement. Since we were also in the business of
designing<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Internet<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; protocols, we wanted to push state to the edges, so that
one could<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; build a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; system to do basic functions without all this cruft in the
middle<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; network. Indeed, Jay has raised the flag on that in a
separate<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; note on this<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; thread. Removing forking from SIP means more of those
B2BUAs. Lots<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; more, I<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; think (in fact, pretty much all proxies will turn into
B2BUAs as a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; default<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; mode). So, given its there already, I'd rather keep it,
and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; instead, do a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; far better job of explaining it in the spec. Its not really
THAT<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hard, its<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; just that the spec is not exactly lucid on this, and many
other,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; topics.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, back to the original question: to fork, or
not-to-fork,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; non-INVITEs. I<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; agree with Christian, and I think there is consensus on
this, that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; forking<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of a non-INVITE only makes sense if (1) that request
establishes<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; no state at<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the UASes, and the set of servers that are reached=20
are<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; homogeneous, so that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a response from any are equivalent, or (2) a 3-way
handshake can<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; be created<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; in some other way, specific to the method. Now, I think its
fair<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to say that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the usefulness of a method that meets (1) is not too high,
and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; worse, we<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; can't guarantee this property for all methods. So, indeed,
the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; question is<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; whether we feel its useful to define, on a method by method
basis<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (or<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; perhaps there is a general purpose solution lurking
somehwhere?),<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; three-way handshake to deal with forked non-INVITE.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; But, if its something that has to be done on a
method-by-method<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; basis,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; perhaps that belongs in the application space, using a
B2BUA. Now,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; this is contradicting myself, since I just argued above
that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; forking of<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; INVITE belongs in the protocol, and not in the application
space.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; But,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; forking of these non-INVITEs is presumably a much less
common<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ocurrence, so<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that putting it in the application space is not as much a
burden.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll be sure to put this topic on my running open-issues
list for<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; London.<br>

Absolutely. Nothing changes as a result of this proposal.

Well, the proposal is not meant to support proxies modifying the To/From,
but rather, allow endpoints to change the To/From in the middle of the call.

Hi,

I have a stupid question that may not be directly related to this
thread....How is the b2bua talking to the transcoder or are they co-located
in the same device?  If not then is it doing this using SIP or MGCP?   If it
is the latter then is this architecture (sorry) just another softswitch
MGC-type of device controlling an MG or is there more?

No; the point is that when C sends a re-INVITE, it would place its own
address in the From field, rather than B's. This way, I could define a
policy like "reject requests with the domain foo.com", and this would work
sensibly for INVITEs and re-INVITEs alike, rather than it working for
re-INVITEs sometimes, depending on whether the call was forwarded.

The gateway would need to generate a new tag for each call leg it accepts.
The idea is that tags should be globally unique across space and time.

Well, part of the proposal as I mention above is that tags should be
globally unqiue across space and time. Its just helpful for identifiers to
have this property, since you don't need to worry about clashes or horrible
special-case problems related to that.

>

>What about the overlapped dialing case? 

Sure, nothing has changed. For overlap, the updated digits come in new
transactions within the same call leg, rather than new call legs. This
doesn't change the fact that they are new transactions.

Now, as a corollary, the transaction ID can be alternatively defined as the
to tag, from tag, call-id, cseq, top via (branch id alone is actually
sufficient if computed as unique as well). If the branch ID is always there,
and is computed as a hash of the r-uri by the proxy which inserts it, then
you don't need to include the r-uri in the transaction ID, since its
effectively there through the via branch ID. This means transaction IDs can
also be URI-less. Just a thought.


>Does this have any impacts on the ways in which UAs allocate 
>tags? (esp. across restarts?) 

Yes. In all cases, tags really need to be globally unique across space and
time. If you want to survive across restarts, you also need to select tags
from some set X, such that there exists some indicator function F, for
which:

F(x) = 1, for x ELEMENT of X
F(x) = 0, for x not-ELEMENT of X

In other words, you can tell from the tag that it was created by this
instance of the proxy. A simple solution is to append a globally unqiue ID
with an instance ID. That has both the uniqueness property, and also meets
the requirement above.

We discussed this issue at the last IETF, and I proposed that wording to
this effect be included in the spec. The consensus, as I recall, was not to
include it, but rather, leave this additional computational aspect to
whatever extension deals with restarts (a draft is pending on that; I've
finished the first cut and it will be done before Friday). However, I think
the baseline requirement for global uniqueness across space/time should be
in bis itself. Other properties can augment that.

You may also be interested to know that in TIA there was a feature called 
vocoder-bypass that essentially mapped the bits into only part of the 64k 
stream and left it in codec form when it was known that both sides used the 
same codec.  That was to avoid the small but additive degradation that 
occurred at every coding-decoding interface.

   Well, stop it :-)

   I sense that what you're hoping for is the moral equivalent
   of an RTP NAT and to that I say TANSTAAFL. There's a variety
   of ways that you could implement and/or control your transcoder
   box, but let's not allow delusion to creep in here that what
   is finally shaked and baked isn't, in fact, a form of an
   application layer gateway, lest the curse of Deering be upon
   you :-)

The Remote-Party-ID of the Privacy draft already 
provides this information if it is passed during 
re-INVITE transactions and reflects appropriate
changes when leaving trusted boundaries.

Allowing the To and From headers to be changed on 
a call-leg potentially could allow the Privacy 
draft to incorporate the rpi-token into the To 
and From without the need of the Remote-Party-ID 
header.  However I guess that proxies couldn't
change the certain headers if the message is
signed.

This is a good enough reason for me.

Sounds good.

This works when the change occurs in the re-invite 
and it contains Require and Proxy-Require.  It doesn't 
work if the change is in the INVITE response unless 
the UAC added Proxy-Require to the INVITE.

Okay, now you've provoked me. :)

The fact that you would assume that the *signalling* needs to go through
some special box to allow transcoding just highlights how entrenched the
mindset that I'm railing against has become. This is a fallacy that no
one seems to even question.

Allow me to clarify.

If we have network-provided transcoding, we'll need to send the RTP
through some transcoder box. There are two ways to achieve this.

The trivial solution is to send the signaling through some transcoder
control box; it acts as a B2BUA, in much the same way that a conference
bridge would. (This is extremely simple for terminals to do: if you send
me an INVITE for a codec I don't know, I send you a 305 response to tell
you to go to my transcoder -- or, if I get a 488 or 606, I send a new
invite through my transcoder).

Alternately, when a codec mismatch is detected, you can set up some
relationship whereby the terminal communicates with a transcoder using
an appropriate protocol (H.248 comes to mind) to pre-arrange the fact
that media coming in to the transcoder on a negotiated port will be
transcoded and sent to the terminal (and the same thing in the reverse
direction).

Both approaches work, and one of them will *need* to be deployed. 

The former has all the drawbacks of a B2BUA combined with the drawbacks of
needing a transcoder in the network; the latter merely has the drawbacks
of having a transcoder. Unfortunately, most people seem to be leaning
towards the first solution -- which is terrible, in my mind. Just because
we're having to use a transcoder should not mean that feature transparency
is destroyed. I'm trying to being attention to the fact that using a B2BUA
for this application is EVIL, and should be avoided when possible.

I agree that trying to put a "transparent" SIP proxy in the path to munge
the SDP is completely the wrong answer, and -- lest anyone be confused --
such a solution is absolutely nothing like what I was suggesting.

Just a small point, the tags are in headers which authentication leaves
unprotected, I submitted a draft yesterday attempting to fix this issue.

	Title		: SIP Authentication: SIP Digest Access Authentication
	Author(s)	: J. Undery
	Filename	: draft-undery-sip-digest-00.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 11-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol [2] currently uses the HTTP digest 
authentication algorithm [3] for simple authentication of SIP 
requests. This scheme does not allow for the inclusion of headers 
important to the integrity of a SIP request including To, From, 
Call-ID, CSeq, Contact and Expires headers. This document attempts 
to address this issue.

	Title		: SIP Cookies
	Author(s)	: D. Willis, B. Rosen
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-cookies-00.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 11-Jul-01
	
This document describes an extension to SIP (RFC 2543) to provide a 
mechanism for storing state and other information in SIP comparable 
to the HTTP state mechanisms defined in RFC 2109.  This extension 
includes a new SIP header ('Cookie:'), an option tag for feature 
negotiation ('cookie') and IANA registration considerations for 
registering the 'cookie' extension, semantics of the value of the 
Cookie: header, and behavioral rules for processing these headers by 
SIP nodes supporting the 'cookie' extension. This document also 
briefly discusses possible uses of cookies, and security 
considerations for their use.

   Ectually, I didn't make that assumption. In fact, "control"
   was meant to allude to what you describe below...

   It really depends, I suspect. The drawback of using MGC/MG
   like decompositions is that there is:

   a) a lot of code needed to drive the MG if you're the MGC
   b) a fundamental assumption of trust between the MGC and MC.
   c) (soft) real time requirements between MG and MGC

   For a simple handset, say, pretending to be a big old
   honkin' MGC is probably overkill, and may run afoul of
   the flash memory gods. The trust issue might be overcome
   by properly "virtualizing" the MG, but there's some question
   in my mind whether that could be done in practice. For (c),
   you'd *really* have to careful... if I were trying to control
   an MG over a krufty cellular link, say, it would be interesting
   times, as they say.

   I'm not dissing the idea, mind you. It's just that it's
   not with its own set of considerations.

	    Mike

   That's not what I'm assuming. I'm assuming that we're
   two bad guys colluding to get free enhanced quality of
   service from my service provider, or you-name-the-service
   which relies on accurately knowing the begin and end of
   calls (like, oh say, calling cards). Unless you have 
   some access to the media, we can always tell the
   service provider that the call is over and merrily
   take advantage of our fR33q0S.

Hi Jonathan,

Perhaps not but I think it could it be used for such a purpose with _huge_
advantage (especially in telephony applications) and yet without being too
open to wholesale abuse. It may also deprecate some of the reasons that
people are using B2BUA-like devices merely so that they can rewrite the
To/From fields (for subscriber identity hiding). [Where transport-layer
identity screening is not important, eg, on a multi-user server or gateway.]

For instance, in telephony applications where it is desired that the caller
can be determined from the From URL, the ingress & egress gateway be able to
map the From URL into a global number context (eg local source number
567-1111 must be mapped to +1-203-567-1111 at the ingress gateway and then
the egress gateway must map this back into the appropriate representation
for the egress domain). This means that there must be a lot of routing
knowledge embedded in each and every endpoint for the correct number format
of the caller at the egress. Heaven forbid when you have internal numbering
and DID lines, etc,etc in the picture. 

This is not a problem for the request-uri because it changes hop-by-hop. For
instance, are request-uri of tel:5672222 can be automatically changed to
tel:+12035672222 when a proxy routes it to an international domain. This is
has previously not been possible for a pure proxy because it changes the
call-leg id. Now with this proposal a proxy can also remap the To & From
numbers into an appropriate format as the leave a number domain. As with all
routing problems they are all a function of local policy. 

Example using a local extension-based dial plan

request-uri: tel:95672222
From: tel:1111

could be remapped to 

request-uri: sip:5672222@my_voip_provider.com
From: sip:1111@nuera.com

In this example the From tel:1111 has no significance outside of internal
number domain. Unless every phone is configured with logic to determine the
external globally reachable domain to insert - the From becomes useless.
What if there are multiple external domains involved? !!!This removes a huge
burden from the configuration of endpoints!!!

Now some might argue that this is the purpose of Remote-Party-Id. I still
believe it has its purpose - there may often be multiple representations of
the Remote-Party-Id. The way I see it is that the From URL provides the
preferred representation and something that still makes sense to a UA that
does not implement Remote-Party-Id extension. It will also be helpful in
actually providing a From URL that can be used to contact/callback the
caller (from the callee's domain).

I can only see this good for encouraging people to solving these real
requirements the right way.

My two cents.

Robert.

I like almost all of what you are saying, but one part is
a little confusing.

If I have a SIP end point, and it's not a PSTN gateway, but
a sipphone, and it doesn't have a codec for whatever is
coming at it, you don't want the sipphone to know about
transcoders and Megaco do you?  You want some intermediate
proxy server to recognize the problem and DTRT.

I really do buy into the central argument that just because
the media stream is going through an extra device DOESN'T
mean the signalling has to.

quite some time and have finally gotten around to
doing so. This is a first cut, and mainly intended
to try to capture as much of what I could remember
requirements and threats-wise (and I've probably
not remembered everything...), as well as taking
a stab at a generalized framework for producing
secured SIP headers using MIME attachments to
arbitrary points in the proxy routed path which
tries to be neutral to the various crypto-systems
folks might want to use in the future (radius, 
smime, kerberos...). Hopefully, this will
stimulate some discussion.

Until it shows up in the drafts repository, you
can fetch a version of it at:

Okay, now you've provoked me. :)

The fact that you would assume that the *signalling* needs to go through
some special box to allow transcoding just highlights how entrenched the
mindset that I'm railing against has become. This is a fallacy that no
one seems to even question.

Allow me to clarify.

If we have network-provided transcoding, we'll need to send the RTP
through some transcoder box. There are two ways to achieve this.

The trivial solution is to send the signaling through some transcoder
control box; it acts as a B2BUA, in much the same way that a conference
bridge would. (This is extremely simple for terminals to do: if you send
me an INVITE for a codec I don't know, I send you a 305 response to tell
you to go to my transcoder -- or, if I get a 488 or 606, I send a new
invite through my transcoder).

Alternately, when a codec mismatch is detected, you can set up some
relationship whereby the terminal communicates with a transcoder using
an appropriate protocol (H.248 comes to mind) to pre-arrange the fact
that media coming in to the transcoder on a negotiated port will be
transcoded and sent to the terminal (and the same thing in the reverse
direction).

Both approaches work, and one of them will *need* to be deployed.

The former has all the drawbacks of a B2BUA combined with the drawbacks
of
needing a transcoder in the network; the latter merely has the drawbacks
of having a transcoder. Unfortunately, most people seem to be leaning
towards the first solution -- which is terrible, in my mind. Just
because
we're having to use a transcoder should not mean that feature
transparency
is destroyed. I'm trying to being attention to the fact that using a
B2BUA
for this application is EVIL, and should be avoided when possible.

I agree that trying to put a "transparent" SIP proxy in the path to
munge
the SDP is completely the wrong answer, and -- lest anyone be
confused --
such a solution is absolutely nothing like what I was suggesting.

i am trying to use trial version of hearme softphone to register
with public proxy servers. i am failing, i think, because i am behind
nat. any sip ua (handset/softphone) available which can work
from behind nat?

thanks,
ravi.

It doesn't necessarily have to be Megaco. I just threw that
out as an example, since I think everyone here is familiar with
the basic operations it can perform.

I *do*, however, think that this is something that the endpoint
itself will initiate, for a variety of reasons:

- Without some really hokey provisioning going on, the node in the
  middle of the network won't know my terminal's capabilities; it
  cannot make the right decision.

- I (as an end-user) will possibly be charged for using these network
  transcoders. I can easily envision getting a call with my a special
  ring that means "this will be a slightly more expensive call
  since it will use a transcoder," and decide to reject or accept it
  based on that information combined with the identity of the calling
  party. I would like to be able to do this real-time by e.g. pressing
  "answer" or "reject" on my terminal, not based on some long-running
  policy provisioned into the handset and/or a server in the network.

- Anything in the middle of the network doing the "Right Thing" will
  be munging the SDP. This is a horrible hack: it breaks security
  models (my signed messages are suddenly tampered with!); it may
  necessarily remove attributes that my endpoint wanted to see; it
  will need upgrading when SDPng is deployed...

Given these arguments, all that is left is the question of *how*
the terminal brings the transcoder into the loop. On its face, it
needs to be able to say "take incoming media encoded by this codec
from this port, transcode it to a different codec, and send it to
a specific IP address at a particular port."

The list of protocols which are designed to say this sort of thing
is rather short. I'll leave it as an exercise for the readers of
this list to find any beyond those that have already been mentioned.

Possibly....... use an Options Method to query a (Proxy?) server for its (known
domain) capabilities for transcoding your example above: 

can you/anybody "take (this) incoming media encoded by this codec from this
port, transcode it to a (specific) different codec....." 

and have that asked Server return the address of a Server/transcoder/B2BUA
(pre-negotiated of not, but it should tell it so) that could perform that
function.... Perhaps that might mean the initial Server returns a 3XX redirect
to that specific 'other' Server. Perhaps even a second Options Method query is
then sent to this redirected (to) Server (from the first response) from the
originating UA in need....

Or come up with a well-known Multicast for transcoders asking for one that has
this capability and the asking UA sends a redirect to the originating UA with
the responding transcoders address and whatever other capabilities or
authentications are required for this multi-legged group of transactions just
to have a single(?) stream transcoded between two (or more) UA's.

just thinking quickly and without thinking it thoroughly (hence the lack of
clarity -- but you might understand the essence to make a comment)

Maybe I'm missing something, but I have the feeling that you are always putting together the session control and the bearer control , which is very likely the case of real user agents, that is end-users, but definitely not the case of servers in the
network, and a B2BUA is defined as appearing as a proxy (RFC2543).
The splitting of the session layer and the bearer layer is the current trend of Next Generation Networks in the Telecom world, including obviously the UMTS environment.

So, when I was talking about a B2BUA providing services (which is still appearing as a proxy) I was not talking about bearer manipulation, codec insertion, etc. Instead, I was talking about services provided on top of the session layer, as e.g. conference,
meet-me, follow-me services, etc.

Now, if the B2BUA concept includes also the bearer handling (which in my personal opinion is going against history), this should be clearly stated in 2543, and the corresponding definition should be improved.

UAs (and B2B UAs) make sense when the UA also needs to terminate media,
as for large-scale conference bridges and anonymizers. I don't think
anybody is arguing with that, although for conference bridges, one would
hope that they are transient phenomena. (Despite the bad press,
multicast is slowly emerging as an option again, at least in selected
environments, such as Internet2.)

I have no idea why you would need B2B UAs for roaming or what they have
to do with QoS (except that they generally are likely to make QoS
worse.)

An additional use of B2BUAs is for media translation, but this is really
only likely for multiparty calls, as quality is much better if you can
avoid transcoding. (I may be underestimating the effect of the screwy
licensing for G.72x and various other low-rate codecs here, which also
could lead to more transcoding than is technically called for.)

I would agree.

For the moment, if it's the case that you _know_ there's
a bug (e.g., it's not a case of "I think that the
Content-Length here is wrong because I think that
'\r' and '\n' are magic and don't exist within the
normal plane of octet existence"), then I would
post it to the SIP list; otherwise, it might be that
you're just not quite grokking fully, and SIP Implementors
is the more appropriate forum [it will always &;) be
picked up by those Pantheonic should the issue really
turn out to be a bug].

However, I think (read as: hope) I'm right in saying
that this is partially a short-term issue, since there
is going to be some sort of bug-reporting/tracking
system put in place for bis...certainly there's been
noise on the list.

HTH,


 - Jo.

I'm not sure that we currently mandate this (only the "second

not MUST).

Well, I know &:) of one implementation at least that does not

Nice.  Although if a proxy was to take this approach, is it
possible it will expose it to an exploit where it will see
signalling that it thinks is for one call, but is in actual
fact for a different call (because (perhaps evil) UAs
sniff Call-IDs)?  It might well be that such proxies are
way too brittle if this is the case, just wanted to float.

Cheers,

Uh.  I get the feeling that I'm going to look like a numpty
because of this, but won't this break older proxies that
attempt to be call-stateful by examining the whole From/To?

Not that I'm advocating this as an approach (although I'd
struggle to see a better way without the new Record-Route:
ing rules), you understand. &:)

Shame.  And I think this is the thing that bothers me most.
If there are going to be occasions where one will be unable
to change the From, then it hardly seems worth it.

Still, I guess it falls back to the (presumably unspoken)
knowledge that no Real Networks are going to have 2543
elements in them....

Eeek!  I think this might be A Bridge Too Far.  Okay,
I guess that proxies could unwind any From (/ To) changes
they made as responses swam back, but this is going to
break loop detection and request-merge detection and
I can imagine lots more with proxies that don't know these
new rules, if nothing else.  Just seems a little bit too
much of a leap to me.

I'm not sure that it is possible to entirely remove it.
Isn't SRV(or whatever)-based server selection a sort of
forking?  I realise it's not quite the same, but there
are certainly elements of commonality.

Which is probably better served by SRV though, right?

Indeed.

The best justification for forking of a non-INVITE that
I ever heard was for the old CANCEL + BYE to quickly
tear down a call.  However, a BYE is pretty unlikely to
work if CPL appeared somewhere in the equation, and
this is only an optimisation, so....

Well, I'm by no means an expert on sip-events, but
something very similar to what Adam proposed with his
SUBSCRIBE + immediate NOTIFYs seems an excellent starting
block.

Still, I'm not sure that this should be in baseline.
Since we suspect that it's far less often the case, it
would perhaps be more prudent to make this a draft a la
SUB/NOT that does delivers nothing in itself, but rather
provides a useful generic framework for other drafts.
(Is there chance that SUB/NOT would become dependent
in such an instance?  This might cause real pain time-
wise.)

I think I'm ambivalent.

Thanks for the response.

Yeah, I definitely think that regardless of whether my addition is deemed a
good idea or not we should consider JR's original suggestion independently. 

That was something I meant to add. The proxy would be required to remain
call stateful (ie, the proxy would have to record-route) and unwind any
changes it made to the To/From for this suggestion to be compatible with
older proxies. Perhaps this is too great a burden to accept? (A Bridge Too
Far). I still think it does have advantages though in my mind. People will
do this sort of thing anyway except they may probably just use a full blown
B2BUA instead - at least with this approach the two UA's can correlate the
call-id in their CDR's.

I've thought about the loop detection before I made the suggestion and I
can't see it breaks it. Older proxies won't detect the loop (because they
will see each instance as a separate call - which doesn't break anything)
but given that the loop must include a proxy that does support the looser
call-id definition (otherwise it wouldn't be loop) then the loop detection
will be made. Right?

Robert.

i am trying to use trial version of hearme softphone to register
with public proxy servers. i am failing, i think, because i am behind
nat. any sip ua (handset/softphone) available which can work
from behind nat?

thanks,
ravi.

Hi all,

I understand from the document 'draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.txt'
that subscriptions must be re-freshed in a similar manner to which
registrations are re-freshed.

My question is, can I set the expires header in SUBSCRIBE messages to a very
high time (e.g. days) whilst retaining the registration duration reasonably
low (e.g. hours) ?

In other words I may want the UA to re-register every hour but I don't want
it to have to re-subscribe too often...

The draft seems to not forbid such behaviour, but am I missing something
else?

Best Regards,

Duncan MILLS

Forgive my agreeing with you, but maybe you *are* missing something.

I'd be very interested in the scenarios under which you beleive
a B2BUA can provide any value add in the conference and meet-me
scenarios without any corresponding node in the media path.

I'm also very interested in knowing how acting as a B2BUA instead
of a proxy when providing a find-me/follow-me service helps in
any way. Given that using a B2BUA destroys feature transparency,
the unnecssary insertion in this case seems very short sighted.

The REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE are independent.
You can set the Expires: to different values
if you want with no ill consequences.

No, I don't think that call statefulness is required.
It just needs to unwind on a transaction basis.  (If
you're thinking that call statefulness could enable
it to "resume" the original From / To on a re-INVITE,
think what a downstream Record-Routed proxy would
see on a re-INVITE from the callee....)

Oh yeah, I can see advantages, but I feel it's a
little bit too brittle: playing with such fundamental
headers now.

True, true.  Didn't think it through enough.

I haven't heard further on this thread.  Do we have WG concensus the
transport parm should be allowed in RR?

Folks,

I've just submitted an I-D on early media. As we agreed upon previously, the
concept of early media would be done as an extension, where it could be
handled properly. The draft proposal fixes all of the known problems with
early media, I believe, and is also nicely backwards compatible with the
existing early media approaches. 

Until it appears in the archives, you can pick up a copy at:

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Folks,

I've submitted an I-D to the archives which discusses the problem of
"crash-and-restart" recovery in a SIP UA. It discusses broader, more
interesting applications of the recovery mechanism, and details the
requirements on how to do it effectively.

Until it appears in the archives, you can pick up a copy at:

Quick Question.

Why are "non-participatory" Redirect Servers required to
copy the Cookie header into responses?  Am I being really
dull here?

Thanks,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Simple way of Reliability of Provisional Responses in 
                          SIP
	Author(s)	: K. Kiss et al.
	Filename	: draft-kiss-sip-s100rel-00.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 13-Jul-01
	
This document specifies an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) providing reliable provisional response
messages. The extension can be seen as an alternative proposal 
of [6], where the method PRACK and the package 100rel are described.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kiss-sip-s100rel-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-kiss-sip-s100rel-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-kiss-sip-s100rel-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: The SIP Proxy-Supported header field

	Filename	: draft-hoeneisen-sip-proxy-supported-00.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 13-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particular
protocol extension has to be used to process the request. The User
Agent Server (UAS) declines the request if it does not support the
extension. Recently also means have been defined for the User Agent
Server (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the User
Agent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring 
proxy servers to understand certain features.

This document describes the interworking between SIP and H.323 
protocols. It defines the the logical entity known as the SIP-H.323 
Interworking Function (SIP-H.323 IWF) that will allow the interworking 
between the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and H.323  protocols. 
This includes the call sequence mapping, message parameter mapping, 
translation between H.245 and SDP, state machines, and handling of 
different call procedures.

Jonathan:

Quick question: in Section 4, when UA3 cannot reconstitute a call (after 
UA2, the original UA, has failed), why does UA1 send a BYE?  Does sending a 
BYE help at all?  If UA3 could not reconstitute the call, it will probably 
not be able to process the BYE as well.

Hi Jonathan,

First of all I have to say that I think it is good that we now have several contributors to this discussion about signaling compression, e.g. SIP compression. I have read your draft and have a number of comments but before I take them all I would like to ask you for some clarifications about how you mean this new "protocol shim" is introduced in reality. You say that it becomes a new alternate transport but it is not clear how this is indicated. Is your intention to create a new "UDP-compress" transport protocol (new protocol ID)? 

Cheers,
/L-E

My understanding was that UA3 would have received the INVITE, 
determined that it could not reconstitute the call (using the 
description in section 6) and then responded with a 481. Btw,
I liked the ideas for the 'To' tag enhancement algorithm. A
BYE is then 'required' to be sent from UA1 and UA3 should be 
capable of handling this, thus terminating the interaction 
between UA1 and UA3 in the 'standard' way.

I think by this Jonathan means to have a new transport parameter for SIP URLs and position the encoding/decoding just above the UDP "stack" code and below the SIP "stack" code. My major concern is the lack of a message acknowledgement mechanism, I know why this was done, however, in the pathelogical case in SIP where all the Request transmissions are lost, the decoder will never update it's codebook from then on adding to the overheads not helping.

James

Hi Jim:

I still don't think UA3 will honor the BYE if it send a 481.  As far as it
is concerned, it could not establish a (reconstituted) session, hence it
send the 481.  So why should it honor a BYE?  According to the spec, a
session (barring early media) is established by the UAS sending a 200 OK,
not a 481.

Regards,

Well, redirect is not as perfect as it may first sound. It has at least the
following two problems:

1. Increased call setup latency (the redirect response has to travel all the
way back to the client before it can be acted upon)

2. It's not always possible to have the call redirected. For example, in ACD
environment the only address available to the UAC should be
sip:customerservice@company.com; you would not want to give away individual
addresses of your customer reps by sending them back in a 3xx response.
Besides, those addresses may not even be reachable outside of company.com
network.

Thank you,
Igor Slepchin

Very thoughtful response, Michael.

I find it interesting that server companies aren't making much more
extensive use of redirect.  It scales well, it keeps (potentially
unnecessary) servers out of a long list of Route-Recorded waystations that
delay message delivery.  Etc.

I suspect it is because of business issues, not technical issues.  If one is
building a server, one needs insure that the server adds lots of value and
stays "in the loop" sufficiently in order that that server pulls in enough
revenue....

Especially if you don't make clients/UAs as well.  Which is why folks like
Sylantro, Broadsoft, and others (whom I'm not letting see this by virtue of
*not* copying the list) are basically *not* implementing even Proxies, but
full, big-honkin B2BUAs as their core architecture (I think).

There is, in the product world, a deep temptation to be in the control loop
wherever possible -- vs. wherever necessary....

Jonathan,

If you really want to push the call state to the edge, then there should be
forking redirect servers, not proxies.  If forking is needed, the associated
information should be sent back to the UAC and let it do the forking of
requests and handling responses.  Some of the previous discussion indicates
ambiguity over whether the forking proxy is handling the transaction
responses or the UAC.  Doesn't seem clean to me.

The reason for the forking is service related, not session setup related and
as such you open pandoras box to other service-related "cruft" being
introduced to the base protocol.  It seems that the main advance of SIP over
legacy protocols was that adherence to general purpose mechanisms that are
not service specific.  Where the legacy systems made a distinction between
basic call setup and supplementary services, they did not keep the protocol
elements associated with each separate.  

Now, it appears that SIP has addressed the basic session setup elements and
is facing the same issues of how to do more advance services as before.
Question is, do you start adding protocol elements that are needed by only
certain classes of services?  After that, when do you stop?  Is there
another way to handle service-specific data that is peculiar to an
application (e.g. supplementary service) but not general to all sessions?

Mike

Well, "some quarters" includes me, at least (maybe only me, but I hope not
:) ).

The reason its in the spec is, as Henning has pointed out, to avoid the
propagation of call state into the network. SIP was designed, first and
foremost, as a rendezvous type of protocol that could find a user at a
multitude of locations, and connect the caller to the called party across
different devices. In its role as a user discovery and connection protocol,
supporting the ability to reach a user at several devices is a big
reuqirement. Since we were also in the business of designing Internet
protocols, we wanted to push state to the edges, so that one could build a
system to do basic functions without all this cruft in the middle of the
network. Indeed, Jay has raised the flag on that in a separate note on this
thread. Removing forking from SIP means more of those B2BUAs. Lots more, I
think (in fact, pretty much all proxies will turn into B2BUAs as a default
mode). So, given its there already, I'd rather keep it, and instead, do a
far better job of explaining it in the spec. Its not really THAT hard, its
just that the spec is not exactly lucid on this, and many other, topics.

Now, back to the original question: to fork, or not-to-fork, non-INVITEs. I
agree with Christian, and I think there is consensus on this, that forking
of a non-INVITE only makes sense if (1) that request establishes no state at
the UASes, and the set of servers that are reached are homogeneous, so that
a response from any are equivalent, or (2) a 3-way handshake can be created
in some other way, specific to the method. Now, I think its fair to say that
the usefulness of a method that meets (1) is not too high, and worse, we
can't guarantee this property for all methods. So, indeed, the question is
whether we feel its useful to define, on a method by method basis (or
perhaps there is a general purpose solution lurking somehwhere?), a
three-way handshake to deal with forked non-INVITE.

But, if its something that has to be done on a method-by-method basis,
perhaps that belongs in the application space, using a B2BUA. Now, maybe
this is contradicting myself, since I just argued above that forking of
INVITE belongs in the protocol, and not in the application space. But,
forking of these non-INVITEs is presumably a much less common ocurrence, so
that putting it in the application space is not as much a burden.

I'll be sure to put this topic on my running open-issues list for London.

OK, I'll bite. How does this differ from the state
draft?  I've scanned it over and it looks to be
doing about the same thing. What am I missing?

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Early Media
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-early-media-00.txt
	Pages		: 23
	Date		: 17-Jul-01
	
Early Media is the ability of two SIP user agents to communicate
before a SIP call is actually established. Support for early media is
important largely for interoperability with the PSTN. Unfortunately,
many SIP devices are providing this capability today without a well-
documented, consistent, and complete solution. We define the problem
of early media, document and describe the difficulties with the
current approach used in SIP UAs, and present a more formal protocol
mechanism that resolves these difficulties

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-early-media-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-rosenberg-sip-early-media-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-early-media-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Call Control - Framework
	Author(s)	: B. Campbell
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-cc-framework-00.txt
	Pages		: 7
	Date		: 17-Jul-01
	
This document proposes that SIP call control features be added in a
modular fashion, using an open-ended framework of extensions instead
of a single extension.  This memo proposes a modular design
philosophy for call control extensions, and lists current
work-in-progress call control related drafts.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-cc-framework-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-cc-framework-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-cc-framework-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Compression of SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt
	Pages		: 12
	Date		: 17-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), along with many other IP
protocols used for multimedia communications, are UDP-based, textual
protocols engineered for bandwidth rich links. As a result, these
messages have not been optimized for message size. With the planned
usage of these protocols in wireless handsets as part of 2.5G and 3G
wireless, the large size of these messages is problematic, primarily
for latency reasons. As a result, we propose a protocol shim between
SIP (or any other UDP based protocol meeting our requirements) and
UDP in order to efficiently compress SIP messages. Preliminary
results have shown compression gains of up to 8:1.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

The first paragraph of 15.4 of draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03 is a big
improvement being more explicit about when subsequent requests can be
sent but there still seems one ambiguity.  Since BYE and CANCEL are
neither "regular transactions" or "INVITE transactions", they are not
covered by the paragraph.

But my greater concern is when UAS state is not in "Completed" state
(Figure 11) and yet INVITE transaction is over: can UAS send BYE.  That
is, UAS has returned 200 OK but not yet received ACK, called party hangs
up (or otherwise called UAS wishes to terminate): can it send BYE.  I
believe that it should NOT.  That it must wait for ACK and then send BYE
(or wait for 7- 200 OKs without receiving ACK), but I cannot see that
this is covered by the paragraph.  Is it covered somewhere else?

I've been waiting for someone to ask this question. I was planning on
writing an I-D on cookies myself until I studied the state draft and
decided that although the draft itself gives undue emphasis to proxies,
the state header still does what we want.=20

My hope is that we can decide on one and only one mechanism for passing
state cookies. If we can accomplish the same thing by a tweak to the
state draft, particularly with respect to examples, then let's ride that
horse. If there's a fatal flaw with the state header, then let's dump it
in favor of a cookie header. But I can't see a good reason to clutter
the standard with both.

OK, I'll bite. How does this differ from the state
draft?  I've scanned it over and it looks to be
doing about the same thing. What am I missing?

Terry,

Two weeks back similar discussion was continued in sip-implementors mailing
list and conclusion was that BYE can be sent by the Called party if it sends
seven 200 OKs and receives no ACK. Actually BYE makes sense if the call is
established. And in this scenario from the UAS perspective the call is
established.

But I don't see any explicit reference of this scenario in bis-03. Does
anybody see this in bis-03?

Regards,
mohib

Subject: [Sip] BIS-03 and UAS BYEs


The first paragraph of 15.4 of draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03 is a big
improvement being more explicit about when subsequent requests can be
sent but there still seems one ambiguity.  Since BYE and CANCEL are
neither "regular transactions" or "INVITE transactions", they are not
covered by the paragraph.

But my greater concern is when UAS state is not in "Completed" state
(Figure 11) and yet INVITE transaction is over: can UAS send BYE.  That
is, UAS has returned 200 OK but not yet received ACK, called party hangs
up (or otherwise called UAS wishes to terminate): can it send BYE.  I
believe that it should NOT.  That it must wait for ACK and then send BYE
(or wait for 7- 200 OKs without receiving ACK), but I cannot see that
this is covered by the paragraph.  Is it covered somewhere else?

Jonathan,

You state that one of the ways to achieve message size reduction is to
define a binary encoding, but that this introduces interoperability
problems.

How can a compression scheme based on dynamically constructed codebooks
be simpler? In my opinion this approach is more prone to interoperability
issues.
Codebooks can get out of sync. As codebooks are specific to a sender-
receiver pair, an entity communicating with multiple other entities, i.e.
a proxy talking to many UA's must manage multiple codebooks.

For trouble shooting one might want to monitor a network interface and
analyze SIP messages coming in. It's impossible to read a compressed
message.

Regards,
Michel

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: A SIP Interface to VoiceXML Dialog Servers
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-vxml-00.txt
	Pages		: 16
	Date		: 18-Jul-01
	
VoiceXML is an XML based scripting language for describing voice
dialogs. VoiceXML interpreters run within an interpreter context
that, among other tasks, provides a call control interface for
accessing the interpreter. It is very natural to provide a VoIP-based
interpreter context that uses SIP and RTP to communicate with the
outside world. In this document, we provide detailed specifications
for a SIP/RTP based interpreter context.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Reconsituting Call State in SIP User Agents
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-reconstitute-00.txt
	Pages		: 13
	Date		: 18-Jul-01
	
In a SIP network, call and session state resides in the user agents
at the edge of the network. These user agents can be elements such as
gateways, conferencing servers, and media servers whose availability
is important for service delivery. In order to achieve fault
tolerance for these user agents, this state must somehow be
replicated to backup servers. Traditionally, replication is done
through direct memory copies between a primary and its backup.
However, the soft-state nature of SIP re-INVITEs means that an
alternate mechanism for call state replication is possible. This
document proposes mechanisms for reconstituting call state in a UA
through triggered re-INVITEs from a peer.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Event Packages for Call Leg and Conference State
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-call-package-00.txt
	Pages		: 30
	Date		: 18-Jul-01
	
This document defines two new event packages for the SIP Events
architecture, along with two new data formats used in notifications
for those packages. The first is a call-leg package, and the second
is a conference package. The call-leg package allows users to
subscribe to another user, an receive notifications about the changes
in state of call legs that the user is involved in.

	Title		: Group Messaging in SIP
	Author(s)	: P. Koskelainen, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-koskelainen-sip-group-00.txt
	Pages		: 
	Date		: 18-Jul-01
	
This document introduces various problems and issues relating to 
the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for group 
messaging. Several potential extensions are analyzed and proposed.
Both one-shot group messaging (paging) and session based group 
messaging are covered in the document. Group chat between human 
beings is one application for group messaging, others exists also 
such as SIP group messaging between robots or game applets.

I must say that I am impressed by the high numbers of drafts Jonathan is churning out of his devious mind. :-)

hey Jonathan, do you get paid per published draft? :-)
Anyway, great job and this will help us at the London IETF.

Cheers

Cookies persist across redirection because the logical association of a
"call" (from a human rather than SIP point of view) persists across
redirection.

A participatory server understands the content of the cookie and may change
it. For example, if one were to implement a call history function (like
cc-redirect) using cookies, a redirect sever could either insert a new
history cookie or update the existing history cookie to explains that a
redirection has occurred, possibly with a reason why that redirection
occurred. Or it might be configured for maximum privacy, and therefore rip
out any cookies that might compromise privacy.

Non-participatory servers don't understand the content of a cookie,
therefore they do not know enough to make a decision on a cookie. They just
blindly propagate the cookies that are there. For example, let's say a call
is redirected twice -- once by a redirector that understands the history
cookie as described above, and once by a redirector that doesn't. The first
redirectory introduces a history cookie. We want that cookie to survive the
second redirection.

In a nutshell, this level of persistency is one thing that differentiates a
"cookie" from a "state header", others being a slightly more expressive
syntac and IANA maechanisms for definining "standard" cookies.

One might ask why a nonparticipatory  redirector returns cookies when UASes
are required to store cookies and resubmit them. It's because of a case that
I'm not sure is handled clearly in the current draft. How does a
participatory server indicate that a particular cookie should be deleted?
Remember that the  UAS doesn't know whether a particular server is
participatory or not on a given cookie. So one approach would be a for a UAS
to discard cookies for a particular call when those cookies aren't present
in a 302 response to that call. I'm not entirely happy with this approach,
and the floor is open for suggestions.

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

Or explicit acknowledgement, which can be either stand-lone or
piggybacked on the compressed message from the other direction.
This makes the compression layer independent of the upper layer
(e.g. SIP in this case). Of course, if there is some interface
between SIP and compression layer, we should not exclude the
use of such interface.

This problem can be alleviated by the static and user-specific 
dictionary or codebook (see 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liu-rohc-scribe-00.txt,
a newer version has been submitted to ROHC WG and should appear
soon). That also allows good compression efficiency for the
first few messages in a session.

Jonathan,

In the diagram of section 4.6, the WRITE HIGH REFERENCE token is shown as 
identical to the WRITE HIGH token. I assume this is a typo. What is the 
intended token for the WRITE HIGH REFERENCE case?

In the same diagram, is there a defined value for the three 'padding' bits 
that fill up the third octet?

In section 5 you describe your proposed new LZW variant. Your 'friendly 
test' shows very nice results, except for the initial message in the 
series, which has an (expected) larger compressed size than the 
uncompressed size. Have you considered jumpstarting the codebook with a set 
of default entries (e.g. INVITE, From:, To:, etc.)? Would you expect 
earlier convergence?

Jay,

Basically, Mahy's draft has a lot more complexity (and
power) than mine.  He wants full call-control by a 3rd
party, perhaps he has some sort of controller-service in
mind.  I want "click-to-dial" that is so simple, everybody
writing addressbook software will incorporate it into their
products.  

I also want to get a point-to-point signature scheme in
place.  Everybody does point-to-point to authentication, but
nobody that I know of is using the holy grail (pki).

The HMAC (point-to-point signature) stuff in my draft is
new, but the "click-to-dial" is implementation/informational
and does not require any protocol changes.  I have no
problem with PGP or SMIME for signing, I just haven't seen
it widely deployed.

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

I agree with your concern about the absense of message acknowledgement. I 
am pleased that you do understand why this is the case, as I don't :-). Is 
it the intention to save on coding complexity or do we want to save a few 
bits over the wire? In the latter case, I think the intent is good, but 
aren't the achieved savings quite modest? In the former case, I don't think 
there are any savings at all, possibly complexity is worsened depending on 
what mechanism is chosen for the encoder to track message reception.

The draft talks about the encoder that learns "in some way" that the 
message was received at the other end. Magic I can think of here would 
either look very much like an (implicit) acknowledgement mechanism, where 
the decoder and encoder on one side of the link communicate to confirm 
message reception. Alternatively, message confirmation might depend on 
direct signalling from the application layer to the compression layer. 
However, since the SIP layer is not aware of the encoder, I don't think 
that's a valid approach. I'd be interested to how this is perceived to work.

By the way, I am not so much concerned with the pathological case you've 
given above. If lower layers are dropping *all* requests, a non-updated 
codebook is probably not my main worry. But I'd agree that in the case of 
deteriorating network behavior, e.g. ramping up towards an overload 
situation, non-updated codebooks are going to worsen the problem.

Romeo

In my view, sending a BYE
right away without waiting for an ACK should be OK. 
The reason being that, if the user has hung up, why keep that UAS blocked
for 'x' amount of time while it could be initiating or terminating new
calls. (makes a lot of sense for Gateways which are acting as B2B UAs and
tying up precious RTP Codecs). The orphaned "ACK" which the UAS might
receive later
can be dropped as it does not belong to an active call and does not require
a response anyway.

Similarly, a UAC should be able to accept a BYE to tear down a session any
time after receiving  a 200 OK. It still sends an ACK (if it hasn't sent
already) though followed by a response for the BYE. 

I do not think PROXYs get affected by this.

thanks

Subject: [Sip] BIS-03 and UAS BYEs


The first paragraph of 15.4 of draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03 is a big
improvement being more explicit about when subsequent requests can be
sent but there still seems one ambiguity.  Since BYE and CANCEL are
neither "regular transactions" or "INVITE transactions", they are not
covered by the paragraph.

But my greater concern is when UAS state is not in "Completed" state
(Figure 11) and yet INVITE transaction is over: can UAS send BYE.  That
is, UAS has returned 200 OK but not yet received ACK, called party hangs
up (or otherwise called UAS wishes to terminate): can it send BYE.  I
believe that it should NOT.  That it must wait for ACK and then send BYE
(or wait for 7- 200 OKs without receiving ACK), but I cannot see that
this is covered by the paragraph.  Is it covered somewhere else?

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

Differences:

1) Much more like HTTP cookies, including most of the syntax. I believe an
HTTP cookie parser could accept the syntax described in the SIP cookie
draft. State headers are quite different.
2) More persistence of the cookie information -- for example, applied to new
calls resulting from redirect or transfer of old one.
3) No IPR restrictions, unlike State (see Ch. 9 of state draft).
4) Clear syntax to identify the source of the cookie.
5) No Supported-header specified. This may or may not be a bonus.
6) The Cookie is not correlated with to/from/callID tags in quite the same
way.
7) Obvious extensibility to define "standard" cookies.

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

Differences:

1) Much more like HTTP cookies, including most of the syntax. I believe an
HTTP cookie parser could accept the syntax described in the SIP cookie
draft. State headers are quite different.
2) More persistence of the cookie information -- for example, applied to new
calls resulting from redirect or transfer of old one.
3) No IPR restrictions, unlike State (see Ch. 9 of state draft).
4) Clear syntax to identify the source of the cookie.
5) No Supported-header specified. This may or may not be a bonus.
6) The Cookie is not correlated with to/from/callID tags in quite the same
way.
7) Obvious extensibility to define "standard" cookies.

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.


	Title		: The SIP Proxy-Supported header field
	Author(s)	: B. Hoeneisen et al.
	Filename	: draft-hoeneisen-sip-proxy-supported-00.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 13-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particular
protocol extension has to be used to process the request. The User
Agent Server (UAS) declines the request if it does not support the
extension. Recently also means have been defined for the User Agent
Server (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the User
Agent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring
proxy servers to understand certain features.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username

NOTE: 
The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Ok, I've had it with one little blurb in rfc2543bis03.

The line that gets quoted "a B2BUA appears as a proxy".

What's it really say?

from the draft:
Back-To-Back User Agent: Also known as a B2BUA, this is a logical entity
that receives an invitation,
and acts as a UAS to process it. In order to determine how the request
should be answered, it acts as
a UAC and initiates a call outwards. A B2BUA appears like a proxy, but
differs in that it maintains
complete call state and must remain in a call. Since it is nothing more than
a concatenation of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN A B2BUA IS A PROXY. IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE A PROXY ON A
NETWORK SCHEMATIC DRAWING. Calls come in. Calls go out. Looks kind of like a
proxy, but it is NOT a proxy and not constrained by the rules of  aproxy.

A B2BUA is application logic which associates one or more calls. Note that
"one or more" is not "exactly two" -- I actually heard someone say recently
that a B2BUA could only deal with two calls at a time, because there are
only two "B"s in the acronym. One must be careful when using acronyms these
days.

So, what does this application logic do? That's up to the application! See
the line in the def that says "Since it is nothing more than a concatenation
of other
logical functions, no explicit definitions are needed for its behavior." The
logical functions are not defined by the SIP speciication, no more than the
specification of every program one could write in C++ is defined in the C++
standard.  One could make a B2BUA that acts like a proxy. Bill Marshall has
argued that a proxy is just a special case of a the more general B2BUA. One
could also use a B2BUA as a firewall controller, a signaling anonymizer, or
many other things.

So why do we have proxies and not just use B2BUAs for everything? Becasuse
the limitations on B2BUA that make it a "proxy" are there for a reason --
they provide for network and feature transparency. In other words, proxies
provide a way to make it relatively easy to add functionality at the edge of
the network and have a reasonable expectation that the new functionality
will actually work. Any B2BUA that does not conform to the rules of proxy
behavior needs to do so very carefully, and is extremely likely to break
some sort of functionality that wasn't considered in the design of that
B2BUA. This is DANGEROUS, and non-proxy B2BUAs must be used VERY CAREFULLY,
with DISRETION, and only when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

Looks there have been a bunch of repeats here. I'm sorry. It looks like some
sort of odd problem between kevlar.softarmor.com and odin.ietf.org . . .
odin kept giving an error response and kevlar kept retrying. Hmm. Any
experts out there?

People,

I'd be interested to know if anybody had any experiences /
thoughts on this.

Currently, I interpret bis-03 as requiring Registrars
(and thus I guess Location Services that use the DB that
a Registrar mutates) to treat a public address of
    fred.bloggs@example.com
as different to
    fred.bloggs@example.com;transport=tcp

This doesn't seem entirely useful.

However, I could perhaps be more sympathetic if someone
wanted
    frances.bloggs@example.com;magic=x
to be different to
    frances.bloggs@example.com;magic=y
Although the fact that neither of these are technically
different to
    frances.bloggs@example.com
does seem to suggest that this is a bogus approach.
(Note: I am finding it difficult to come up with a
reasonable parameter name, which is why I chose "magic")

The classic, I think, is:
    0123456789@sip-gateway.example.com
being different to
    0123456789@sip-gateway.example.com;user=phone
.  I have to admit that I do (and I expect people to
start shouting at me here) find catering for such
terminal mobility slightly anachronstic, since surely
this is only solving a transitional concern?  Not to
mention the fact that have had experience of parties
expecting these two to be equivalent (i.e., REGISTER
as one, INVITE to the other).

So the crux is that should we only be considering
the user part and host part in these matters?  Personally,
I fluctuate on a day to day basis, so I'd be interested
if anybody could ease my nausea.

Thank you,


 - Jo.

Whoops, I should have said:
    fred.bloggs@example.com
as different to
    fred.bloggs@example.com:6000
as transport is not legal in the SIP URL of a To
header.

Yours slightly red-faced,

Hello all,

I had a question regarding the draft-dean-handoff-00.txt
The draft is due to expire this month. Last discussion I
could trace on the topic was in Feb ... the thread with
subject "draft-ietf-sip-handoff-00pre8.txt" :
http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2001q1/005711.html

Is there some work still continuing on this draft? Or has it
been abandoned in favour of the REFER approach to transfer?

If not, when can a new version of the draft be expected? The
approach does seem to be simpler in some respects, but are
there any downsides for which there's not much talk on this
draft at present? Pointers to relevant information would be
much appreciated! :)

Thanks in advance,
Siddharth.

The 3-way SCRIBE acknowledgement seems rather elaborate for 
what it needs to do. The ROGER draft section 5.6 shows that 
at least the third leg of the acknowledgement can be done
implicitly too.

My understanding of the SIP compression draft is that the
interface is left unspecified. However, defining an internal
mechanism to allow the application layer to keep track of the
messages sent at the compression layer seems more complex than
defining a simple acknowledgement scheme.

I agree a partially static/profile dependent dictionary would 
be expected to show better results for the initial messages in 
a series of messages. In the case of mid-session network 
deterioration, a dynamic mechanism would add some additional 
overhead trying to update the codebook, whereas a static 
mechanism obviously would not, but I don't think that this 
would push the overall scale to favour static dictionaries.

The version -00 SCRIBE draft does not show any examples or 
compression ratio assessments. Both the SIP compression draft 
and the ROGER draft have some very rough and hard to compare 
examples. Is there a draft that shows assessments of the
achievable compression results with SCRIBE? 

Romeo

I have asked Hans Hannu to make his benchmarks available to the WG -- or if
anybody else has some, having them available would help.

Hi,

We chose the "Successful Simple SIP to SIP" call flow from
Section 3.1.1 of <draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-05.txt> to
benchmark our own SIP compression scheme.

Initially the "dictionary" of previously received messages
is empty, but new messages can be compressed relative to all
previously received messages. This illustrates nicely how the
compression ratio goes up with a more comprehensive dictionary.

The results for our scheme are as follows:

Message Size	Compressed Size		Compression Ratio

	423			152				2.78
	189			6				31.50
	205			16				12.81
	420			28				15.00

If anyone has an alternative set of SIP messages, we could provide
compression ratios for these also.

I have asked Hans Hannu to make his benchmarks available to the WG -- or if
anybody else has some, having them available would help.

  This draft is not being continued.  It was basically decided at the

Hi,

Apologies to members of the SIP mailing list who haven't received
my previous emails on the subject. The scheme in question is
EPIC (Efficient Protocol-Independent Compression) which is a
programmable compression scheme with a very high level of efficiency.

There is also a "learning" version of EPIC that does not need to be
programmed - we used this to obtain the results for SIP compression.

The new EPIC draft is being published today - we will post a copy on
our website and provide the link shortly.

Regards,

Richard P

Hi Richard,

Thanks for this info, results look impressive. I am a bit confused
when you say "our own SIP compression scheme". So that's not SCRIBE
or ROGER, is it? Has that scheme been documented anywhere?

The 3-way acknowledgement is needed to handle message loss,
misordering, and concurrent updates initiated by both CD
entities (this is not an issue in "split mode", but an issue
in "shared mode"). SCRIBE-01 has some more detail on this.
(It was submitted on July 18, probably still in the queue.
I'll post it somewhere and let you know the URL.)

I haven't read the new ROGER draft. I'll check what you pointed
out.

I agree. As you can see, I favor an explicit independent acknowledgement
at compression layer. But to be fair, I can see that some application
may determine what message has been received by its peer (e.g. due to
request-response nature) and inform this to compression layer. However,
I think acknowledgement at compression layer is cleaner and better,
and should be the base of anything else.

That is still an open question to me. What I can say now is
that it depends (e.g. what protocol is compressed, compressor
and decompressor's capability, how complex we want to go).
Static/profile can be the basic mechanism, then dynamic 
update can further boost the compression performance. 
We should have a flexible framework to adapt the needs. More
details can be find in SCRIBE-01.

You will find performance data in SCRIBE-01.

Rohan, others,
  
   Greetings.

   I read your draft "A Call Control Model for SIP",  
   draft-mahy-sip-cc-models-00.txt with interest. It does
   a good job describing various call configurations.

   I think a definition of what you mean by "call control
   model" would help me follow along better. All call
   models I have come across so far include call states, 
   and transitions between states. The messages from the 
   supported signaling protocol provide the stimulus for
   these transitions. Is there such a state model for SIP
   that includes all the SIP primitives defined thus far? 
   If so, is there a draft that covers this?

   I understand from the "SIP Call Control - Framework"
   draft that the intent is to support a modular call
   control model for SIP. Does this mean there will be
   a modular state machine (if and when a state machine
   is defined)?

   Yes, I did also read the draft "SIP Extensions for 
   supporting Distributed Call State", and while there is
   talk of state distribution among network nodes using
   the SIP STATE header there (and this is illustrated
   with some nice examples), there is again no mention
   of a "standard" set of states. Presumably, if a 
   different proxy from the one that stored state on the
   server was given this state information at a later time
   in order to help process the same call (since the intent
   is to keep proxies effectively stateless), the second 
   proxy should be able to interpret what the stored state 
   really represents in the call context. I guess what I'm
   requesting is an explanation of how this works. 

   There seems to be an implicit expectation in the state
   draft that the same proxy will receive all subsequent 
   messages with call state information. Is the above
   scenario with two proxies supportable? (I realize some
   crypto details may have to change for this to happen).
   Thank you.

respectfully,
Kumar.

Richard,

I think your draft is already in the IETF repository. I've glanced
over it just now, so maybe I missed some of the fine print, but
here's one comment.

The compression results of your protocol seem impresssive. However,
an immediate drawback of using a 'programmed' protocol like this,
is that this is a rather inflexible approach. E.g. compression
of new extensions popping up will not be supported until new
versions of the en/decoders have been distributed to all involved
nodes (network and endpoints). I think that is a practical problem
in many scenarios.

Hi,

A nice property of "learning" EPIC is that we can always compress
any message, but the compression ratio is proportional to how much
we know about the message structure. If we know nothing at all about
the message structure then the scheme behaves in an identical manner
to conventional Lempel-Ziv (LZ-78).

This means that we can program the scheme for SIP compression and
obtain a very high compression ratio (double Lempel-Ziv) but we can
still compress all future extensions. The compression ratio will
gradually degrade until the programming is completely out-of-date,
in which case we are back to Lempel-Ziv.

Processing and memory requirements behave in the same manner: if EPIC
has complete knowledge of SIP then the working memory requirements are
extremely low (sub 100 bytes) since it discards all previously received
data except useful strings such as URLs. Memory requirements increase as
the knowledge of SIP degrades, since EPIC must store more in the dictionary
to ensure a good compression ratio.

I hope this alleviates your concern!

Best regards,

Richard P

Hello,

Before SCRIBE-01 shows up in the IETF repository, you can
pick it up at
http://people.nokia.net/~patil/draft-liu-rohc-scribe-01.txt.

Some preliminary performance results can be found in Appendix A.
Only static/profile dictionary was used (no dynamic dictionary
update). 

Note that the draft focuses on a framework with necessary mechanisms 
to synchronize data used by compression/decompression (CD data). The 
framework is flexible to cover different synchronization scenarios 
with different complexity (and compression efficiency). Different 
compression algorithms can run on top of the synchronization 
chassis.

Your comments are welcome.

Br,
Zhigang

The main difference is, that with the Proxy-Supported mechanism
the intermediate _proxy_servers_ are queried for support of certain
features, whereas the draft-ietf-sip-serverfeatures-04
(Supported header field) describes a mechanism, where the
_User_Agent_ informs about features itself supports.

This proposal (Proxy-Supported) somehow complements the Proxy-Require
mechanism. With Proxy-Supported a request goes through even if one
(or more) of the intermediate proxy servers doesn't support an
indicated extension, whereas Proxy-Require results in an error
response in the proxy server.

Hope this answers your question.

 Bernie

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particular
protocol extension has to be used to process the request. The User
Agent Server (UAS) declines the request if it does not support the
extension. Recently also means have been defined for the User Agent
Server (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the User
Agent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring
proxy servers to understand certain features.

  Hi all,

  I submitted an updated version of the Replaces draft.  It's available
here until its announced:

  http://www.billybiggs.com/sip/draft-biggs-sip-replaces-01.txt

  The remaining open issue is the call-leg identifier we should use.
The consensus seems to be that Replaces should uniquely identify a call,
regardless of how much information that requires.

  I'm personally a huge supporter of Jonathan's proposal to simplify
call-leg identification down to callid + tags.  Depending on how things
look after this IETF, Replaces will either stay as it is or include the
full to and from verbatim.

  The changes to the draft were making tags mandatory, clarifications to
behavior (for example for unconnected calls), and some editorial
cleanups.  The next revision of this draft will appear as a SIP WG
draft.

With Proxy-Require, it is clear what is intended:
you require every proxy on the path to support/use
a given extension. With Proxy-Supported, this is
more difficult. You are querying for the (optional)
support of a feature. What does it mean for 3 out
of 4 proxies to support a given feature? 

The biggest problem I see with this approach is
that it doesn't work for the initial request (e.g
INVITE). Most features that come to mind need to
be invoked on the initial request and possibly
subsequent requests for a call. 

regards,
sean olson

Hi,

New versions of the EPIC drafts have now been submitted to the
Internet Drafts editor. In the meantime, the drafts are available
from the following URLS:

http://www.epic.roke.co.uk/epic/draft-ietf-rohc-tcp-epic-01.txt

This draft describes the basic EPIC programmable compression scheme
and uses it to generate a ROHC profile for TCP/IP compression.

http://www.epic.roke.co.uk/epic/draft-price-rohc-signaling-epic-00.txt

This draft describes a "learning" version of EPIC that does not
require programming, and uses it to generate a ROHC profile for
SIP compression.

http://www.epic.roke.co.uk/epic/draft-price-rohc-epic-02.txt

This draft describes an optional enhancement to EPIC which boosts the
compression efficiency.

We hope you have as much fun reading these drafts as we had writing them(!)

Best regards,

Richard Price

Hi,

Apologies to members of the SIP mailing list who haven't received
my previous emails on the subject. The scheme in question is
EPIC (Efficient Protocol-Independent Compression) which is a
programmable compression scheme with a very high level of efficiency.

There is also a "learning" version of EPIC that does not need to be
programmed - we used this to obtain the results for SIP compression.

The new EPIC draft is being published today - we will post a copy on
our website and provide the link shortly.

Regards,

Richard P

Hi Richard,

Thanks for this info, results look impressive. I am a bit confused
when you say "our own SIP compression scheme". So that's not SCRIBE
or ROGER, is it? Has that scheme been documented anywhere?

Just a reminder about how the Area Directors feel we should be using our
precious face-to-face meeting time.

Since I can't say it any better than Scott, I've just borrowed his words . .

You might take a look at my security draft which
tries to make sense of all of this. I don't think
SIP has any way of returning an error right now, nor
any way for a UAC to indicate to the UAS that it's
response was garbled.  This may be worth exploring
more. One of the counterpoints to feeding errors
back is that you might be giving an attacker
information that it shouldn't be getting (ie,
silently discarding bogons is better). A
counter-counterpoint is that Kerberos, say,
relies on certain errors to be processed, namely
clock skew errors, so maybe it's a requirement in
some situations, and optional in others.

As far as negotiation goes, there's nothing in
there now that I know of, but the security draft
attempts to do that.

Jonathan,

To follow up on my passing comments, it should be
noted that IPsec already has compression
transforms which work in combination with
encryption/message integrity. I'm not sure if TLS
has this capability, but I wouldn't be surprised
(nor do I think it would be hard to add if
not). Thus, there's at least some amount of wheel
reinvention going on here.

That said, it may be interesting to consider
taking the same tack as IPsec compression for SIP
security which has the same problem as all
encryption/compression schemes which is that you
must compress before encrypting to do anything
useful. Thus, it would be natural for secure SIP
headers and bodies (attachments, as I propose) to
allow compression transforms as well.

The synergy between our two drafts, I think, may
lie in something that I've been toying with: the
ability to have a complete SIP application layer
security scheme which not only deals with the
problem which is clearly in the SIP domain (crypto
for parts of the SIP payload), but could also be
used to provide hop-by-hop
encryption/authentication as well negating the
need to require a base level secure transport
mechanism (eg, IPsec, TLS).  I think this is
possible by extending my current proposal to
insert a shim layer much like you propose in this
draft here. I haven't included this in the current
draft (mostly because it's not a baked idea), but
it would make sense to my mind that if we allow
compression, we ought to fold it into the security
framework mainly because of the compress-then-encrypt
problem.

Billy,

The examples in section 5 and 6 use a REFER/100-Trying/200-OK message flow
instead of the REFER/202-Accepted & NOTIFY/200-OK required by
draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-04.txt. Is there a reason for this?

Also, since the call leg being replaced is the one between the Transferor
and the Target, shouldn't call-id 2 be passed in the Replaces header in the
REFER and the INVITE?

I also like the proposal to simplify call leg identification.

This is question for the WG chairs, but since this extension is referred to
by draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-05.txt, shouldn't it be a WG Item?

  No reason, just my poor editing skills.  I'll fix it now, and update
it in the next version.

  Yeah, that's also broken.  Many apologies.

  It is, I belive, I just wanted to get it announced before IETF.

There is a requirement to perform compression in 3GPP (and presumably in
3GPP2) between the  UAS and the first proxy (UE to P-CSCF in 3GPP). TS
24.228 shows the current flows for this (version 1.1.0 is at
ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/Specs/Latest_drafts/ ). Unfortunately this document only
partially populates the example fields, and relies on a shorthand notation
in order to identify the contents of remaining fields from the previous
tables - we are looking for someone to write a macro that will do this
population automatically before final publication).

We have yet to choose the compression scheme, and obviously would prefer
something that is IETF defined. Expect that some discussion on this should
take place in the SIPPING WG 2nd session in London.

One thing that should be born in mind is that there is also a requirement
for encryption on the above radio interface. The encryption mechanism to be
used is still under discussion. I assume that depending on whether the
encryption is performed before the compression or after will have a drastic
effect on the compression.

Hi,

I'm the first to admit (I've mentioned it before) that the PRACK
mechanism is very "heavy", and what you propose has been discussed
before (I think I was even one of those who proposed it back then...),
but the argument against it was that it is against the SIP semantics,
since ACK is the ONLY method which is sent without a response - and I
think that makes very much sense.

So, while we can (and we SHALL) come up with new cool features for SIP,
we should avoid touching the protocol core. In this case we would have
to change the semantics of a SIP transaction, since the bis specifies
how INVITEs are handled, how ACKs are handled, and how ALL OTHER methods
(standard- or extension methods) should be handled - ie we would have to
change the bis too. Do we want to do that?

Also, lately we've also seen that PRACK probably will be used for more
than just acking a provisional response. The COMET draft shows one
example, and Jonathan also gave a very interesting proposal to solve the
early media issue using PRACK.

These were only my personal opinions, though...

I also have a few questions on the text in the draft.

6.2. UAS Behavior

The third chapter says:

"If the request did not include a Proxy-Supported header indicating this
feature is understood by every record-route proxy, but it included a
Supported or a Require header indicating this feature, the UAS either
SHOULD send the provisional response using the reliability mechanism
defiend in [6] or it SHOULD send the provisional response unreliably."

Q1: You have a "SHOULD-OR-SHOULD" statement here. I think that SHOULD as
such confuses people enough, but now I'm really lost... :)

Q2: You write that if SPRACK can't be used, the UAS SHOULD send the
provisional response using the mechanism defined in [6] (the PRACK
method). To me this indicates that the UAS also SHOULD support the
mechanism defined in [6]...

Could you please outline a bit further, what is

Sorry, but I don't understand this question.
Could you please describe the issue a bit further.

First of all: "Proxy-Supported" is _not_ intended to
be a general replacement for "Proxy-Require".
(I wasn't sure, whether this has been misunderstood.)

With "Proxy-Supported" a proxy server knows latest
about the feature support in all proxies (which
remain in the signalling path for subsequent
requests), when the first (non-100Trying) response
to the INVITE is arriving at the proxy server.
For certain features this is early enough.

But the more important cases are, where certain
features are used only in subsequent requests.
One example is described in
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kiss-sip-s100rel-00.txt,
which proposes a light way of the provisional
response acknowledgement. 

The main goal of the "Proxy-Supported" proposal is,
that in those cases, where certain features are used
only in subsequent requests, an INVITE goes through
to the UAS even if one (or more) proxy servers do not
support one (or more) listed feature.

Furthermore it addresses only those proxy servers,
which remain in the signalling path for subsequent
requests.

Hope things got more clear now...

br,
 Bernie

Hi,

My comments...

In general, I think it is a good idea if proxies somehow can indicate
features that they support. For example, in the discussion about to be
able to CANCEL a specific call-leg I mentined that the UAC could use
that information to decide if to keep or cancel a call-leg etc etc. In
the forward direction it can also be used by proxies to decided where/if
to fork a request (yes, this IS related to the caller preferences
draft).

My opinion about your proposal (I DID understand the draft - I hope :),
though, is that I think you try to make things too complicated.

First, why do we need a new header (Proxy-Supported) for this? Why can't
the Supported header be used, and the proxies can then check the option
tags and add Record-Route parameter(s) if needed.

Second (and this is what I think makes it complicated) is the proposal
that the proxies shall remove option tags from the header, and remove
the whole header if there are no more option tags innit... I don't think
this is necessary. The UAS, and the UAC, simply have to check the
Record-Route headers to check if all proxies support a specific feature.
Yes, it takes a little more time, but it is more simple.

Hi,

I had a quick look at the draft, and here are some comments. Most of
them cosmetic, but still...

First, I agree that Solution 1 seems to be the way to go. It doesn't
require much extensions (new methods etc), it is (in theory, at
least...) backward compatible.

...and it gives us a reason to spend bandwith and CPU power on PRACK
transactions :)

The questions:


Chapter 4.1 UAC Behaviour

Q1. The text says: "If the UAS wishes to refuse the early media stream,
it SHOULD set the port number for each media stream in the answer to
zero"

- I guess it shall be "If the UAC wishes...."? A spelling error, I
assume.

- Why is it "SHOULD set the port..."? Doesn't it have to be MUST to make
it work?

- I read about setting port numbers set to zero... Does this work with
ATM too?


Q2. Later, the text says: "If the UAS wishes to accept the early media
stream, it generates..."

Again, I guess it shall be "If the UAC wishes to accept..."?


Q3. Later, the text says: "In that case, it MUST continue to be prepared
to receive media according to the information in the SDP in the original
INVITE"

The reason for this is, of course, that a UAS may not send 1xx. Instead
it sends 200, and media to the address/port given in the INVITE.
However, I think it should be written that IF a UAS sends 1xx, AND the
UAC sends a NEW address/port in the PRACK, that that specific UAS MUST
send the early media to the address/port given in the PRACK, and nowhere
else. That may sound obvious, but I think it should be there for
clarification...

Here we still do have a small problem, though. If multiple UAS nodes
send 200, they may also start sending media at the same time. This means
that the UAC may receive, even if for a short while (until the unwanted
legs have been ACK/BYEed), a mix of media streams on the same
port/address. I guess this is something we have to live with, though...


Q4. Later, the text says that, if multiple legs are established, the UAC
can choose to reject early media from one or more of them. I know it
doesn't belong to this discussion, but this brings my thoughts back to
the discussion we had some weeks ago about being able to CANCEL a
specific call-leg. For example, if the UAC knows it will not accept a
specific call-leg, should it refuse the early media, wait for the 200,
and then ACK/BYE the call - instead of CANCEL it right away?


Q5. If a UAC refuses to accept early media from a UAS, the UAS may
choose to not accept the call setup. Should we specify (or at least
recommend) which response code to use in this case?


Q6. This is related to the re-INVITEs.

Assume that UAC sends an INVITE, and then receives 1xx (including
Contact).

Now, the UAC may (for any reason) want to change the media parameters
for that specific leg, so it sends a re-INVITE with the new parameters,
to the address received in the Contact. Nothing strange here.

However, the UAC may (for any reason) want to change the media
parameters for ALL possible receivers, even if it has received 1xx from
one or more servers. In this case it would send a re-INVITE, WITHOUT
using any Contact, or any tag (since we want the re-INVITE to be
handled/forked in the same way as the original INVITE). I guess this
would not cause any major problems either, but do you think it should be
mentioned in the draft?

A more complicated case is when the UAC receives 1xx from a UAS. It may
provide new media parameters in the PRACK, BUT again it may also want to
(for any reason) send a re-INVITE to all possible receivers (ie by not
using Contact and tags) - EXCEPT to the UAS it has sent the PRACK to.
Again, I guess this is only one of thousands of different scenarios that
we can come up with, and we can't describe them all. However, this
specific case could be solved using the don't-fork-to feature
(Reject-Contact header) in the caller preferences, so maybe it would be
cool to include...


Chapter 4.2 UAS Behaviour

Q7. The text says: "The provisional response MUST contain a Require
header with the "em" and "100rel".

This is just a detail, but do we MUST put "em" in Require? Can't
Supported be used instead?


That's all for this time...

This I-D does _not_ intend to change the core specs; meaning, that it is an
extension mechanism, which can be used only if all intermediate proxy
servers (and the UAs) do understand the feature. If this is the case, they
shall treat SPRACK similar than ACK.

Or do you mean, that the RFC2543bis specs strictly forbids such kind of
extensions, although it is technically feasible and backwards compatible?
What is the opinion of the authors of RFC2543bis concerning this?

Does the 200 OK of PRACK carry some relevant information in these cases?
If yes, the PRACK might be more appropriate for these cases.

It seems, that the relationship between s100rel and 100rel needs some more
general explanations and the referred section some refinement. Thanks for
your feedback.

I try to explain here what is meant:

- The s100rel package contains somehow the capabilities of the 100rel
package. Whenever a response is to be sent reliably and s100rel can be used,
then use s100rel (SPRACK); otherwise use 100rel (PRACK)

- If _no_ Proxy-Supported (s100rel), but a Require (s100rel) are present ,
then use always 100rel (i.e. response contains "Require: 100rel" and is
acknowledged by PRACK)

- If _no_ Proxy-Supported (s100rel), but a Supported (s100rel) and _no_
Require (s100rel) are present, then either use 100rel or send it unreliable
(as appropriate; decision by the UAS).

Hope this makes things clear...:)

Hi,

draft-sip-refer-00 contains the following example for Refer-To:

Refer-To: sip:bob@biloxi.com?Accept-Contact=sip:bobsdesk.
                   biloxi.com&Call-ID=55432@alicepc.atlanta.com

but this is not a legal SIP URL according to bis-03 - an hvalue (part of
header) can't have a '@' in it.

Well, I guess it's a question of definitions here.

The core spec does define a SIP transaction, also for extension methods.
One could argue that an extension is allowed to change that, since it
doesn't matter as long as every node understand the extension. BUT -
then we may end up in a situation when people start changing other
things in the core too. At the end we may even end up having completely
different protocols (well, I know it sounds a little dramatic, but you
get the point, right? :)

One of the nice (maybe the nicest) feature of SIP is that it allows us
to define extensions, without changing the core, and if a node doesn't
understand the extension it simply ignores it. Ie, I can define how many
new methods I want, how many new headers I want, and how many new option
tags I want, without touching the core - as long as I define them
according to what the core says. Of course some extensions require
support from the other nodes, but again, that is not a problem as long
as I use the mechanisms defined in the core.

The problem here is that first came SIP, then came the need for being
able to acknowledge provisional responses... :) So, I think that many
people agree (at least I do :) that PRACK is not the nicest, best and
far from the most efficient way to do it, but unfortunately it's the
only way SIP allows us to do it.

I would say that in most cases, especially when it's used only to
acknowledge a 1xx response, it does carry any relevant information. 

I don't think the question is about if SPRACK could be used instead of
PRACK. In many cases I think it could, and what you propose has been
discussed before. The issue is the core protocol.

That is how I understood it too, but it was the relationship that
confused me a little. IF we are going to use SPRACK, I think the whole
mechanism about reliability of provisional responses has to be
re-designed, because like was said earlier: in many cases there is no
idea to even implement PRACK if SPRACK is used.
 
Another question about the draft: What if we use a default outbound
server, which does NOT record-route? How do we know if it supports
SPRACK? I don't think one can always "assume" it does.

Folks,

I have submitted an updated version of the bis specification,
draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04. This should appear in the archives later this
week. In the meantime, you can pick up a copy from:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.txt
http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.ps
http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.pdf

Some people complained about difficulties downloading the PDF version from
the site, so I have also left a copy at:

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jdrosen/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.pdf
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jdrosen/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.ps
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jdrosen/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04.txt

The changes between bis-03 and bis-04 are a collection of mostly minor
stuff, detailed in Appendix J.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Folks,

I've submitted an update to draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw, which discusses
traversal of SIP through enterprise and residential nats. There are a LOT of
differences between this version (-02) and the previous. Specifically:

1. SIP "via port" parameter defined to allow SIP-UDP traversal
2. Translate header replaces Contact cookie
3. NAT detection and allocation protocol is defined, and used between the UA
and some elements deployed in the SIP provider network. This is effectively
midcom without midcom compliant nats. It vastly simplifies things and also
solves the case where both sides are behind a symmetric nat.
4. lots more

Until the draft appears in the archives, you can pick up a copy at:

Folks,

I've submitted an update to draft-ietf-sip-session-timer. This version is
substantially different from the previous. As discussed on the list, I've
added the Minimum-Timer header (called Min-SE), and also took Brett's
suggestion to define a refresher parameter to session expires, in order to
avoid overloading Require/Supported to figure out who is refreshing the
session. This made things a whole lot simpler, I think.

Until the draft appears in the archives, you can pick up a copy at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt

There are still some open issues. The main one is whether or not we want to
remove the usage of absolute times in Session-Expires, since they always
need to be converted to delta-times anyway. Comments on that?

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Hi Jonathan,

Very interesting draft. 

I have a couple of comments. It seems that in section 4.2 Contact
Translation (and maybe I am being thick...) that the proxy Y is not required
to Record-Route the call:

   "In order for this connection to be used for re-INVITEs or BYEs, the
   proxy needs to record route."

Thus when Joe calls Bob and Proxy Y does not Record-Route then the Joe would
send the ACK directly to the Translated Contact in the 200 OK from Bob.
However this is not going to work for a symmetric NAT. Shouldn't there be
some sort of requirement that Proxy Y must Record-Route unless Bob's NAT is
known to be a cone NAT (eg indicated in Translate header)? Am I completely
missing something here?

Also for the symmetric RTP section: I think would be much more interoperable
if we define symmetric RTP as being indicated when transport profile RTP/AVP
is used _AND_ the a=direction parameter is present (rather than a new
transport profile "RTP/UDP"). In this manner a UA supporting symmetric RTP
and a plain vanilla UA can still communicate when NAT is not involved.
Obviously it is much cleaner that a separate transport profile is used but I
believe it will hamper the deployment of your suggestion. 

In the above suggestion, a UA not understanding symmetric RTP (ie, not
understanding the direction attribute) will setup a call as normal.
Additionally, the UA supporting symmetric RTP can detect that the peer does
not support the extension by the lack of the a=direction attribute in the
SDP answer. Simple!

Regards,

Robert.

Perhaps I am misinterpreting the quoted statement (in original email),
Jonathan? I think perhaps you might be saying that the proxy Y must always
record-route - regardless of whether the proxy wants to be on the call path
for re-INVITE's and BYE's. However, there doesn't seem to be any requirement
for this when the NAT is known to be of the cone type.

SIP is not intended to transport large amounts of information.
That plus the ratio of bandwidth used by signalling vs.
the bandwidth used by the media, means that signalling compression
for SIP is not in general a problem. It only really becomes a
problem on low bandwidth, high latency *links* such as a cellular
link where sometimes every byte counts.

In short, I believe signalling compression is a hop-by-hop
problem and not an end-to-end one. A hop-by-hop solution seems
appropriate in this case. 

It should also be noted that you can always apply gzip compression
to the MIME body of a SIP message to achieve some end-to-end
compression. IMHO, this is not needed.

I believe the compression techniques that have been
described so far (ROGER, SCRIBE, EPIC, etc.) are
fairly generic and would work well on a variety of
link types. Some have been tailored with cellular
in mind. 

Hopefully this addresses your concerns,

RoHC works hop-to-hop, not end-to-end when there are multiple hops between two ends. 
Does SIP Compression mechanisms also have this constraint? If yes, why? 
Are those designed to work only on cellular link between mobile terminal and 
fixed end of cellular link (hop-to-hop) ? Why those mechanisms are not designed
 for end-to-end compression? 
(reduce large payloads ,whatever be the link characteristics...)

The idea is a fall-back behavior: In the cases SPRACK is not possible, PRACK
can be used; thus the s100rel package contains somehow the 100rel package.

This case should have been discussed in the I-D. It somehow got forgotten...
Thanks for the reminder.
The principle idea for this case is, that whoever uses an outbound proxy
MUST know about its support of the s100rel. Otherwise s100rel MUST NOT be
used.

I don't see the reasons for such constraint. In fact, if 
encryption is applied end-to-end, per-hop compression is 
not feasible. See 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-le-sigcompr-requirements-00.tx
t
and http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liu-rohc-scribe-01.txt.

No. SCRIBE and some of other schemes do not assume hop-to-hop.
They can tolerate packet loss, misordering and large round
trip time.

I don't know which mechanisms you're referring to. At
least SCRIBE can work as end-to-end compression. However,
the open issue is whether it is needed in fixed-line 
network considering the benefit/cost ratio. It is 
clearly needed over cellular links.

Jonathan,

 Section 16.3 includes the following updated language in the second
paragraph (thanks):

The URL SHOULD NOT contain the
transport parameter, but can in private networks where it is known
that elements on both sides of the proxy support the specific
transport.   

 However, the following language in paragraph 4 also needs to be modified so
there is no conflict:

The proxy MAY modify the Record-Route
value matching the one it inserted into the request. Like the URL in
the request, it MUST be a SIP URL and MUST NOT contain a transport
parameter. 


 I'd also like to note that since the Record-Route may be modified, it is
possible the transport could be modified, thus elements on both sides of the
proxy may not need to support the specific transport as the first modified
language indicates.  For example, leave off the transport on the
Record-Route of an Invite going into the private network so UDP defaults on
the inside, and include transport=tls in the 200 OK's Record-Route when
interfacing with another element over an unsecure network.  This allows
subsequent requests to run over the same secure connection an initial
transaction ran over, without requiring the same transport on the other side
of the proxy.

John

Folks,

I have submitted an updated version of the bis specification,
draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04. This should appear in the archives later this

Some people complained about difficulties downloading the PDF version from
the site, so I have also left a copy at:

The changes between bis-03 and bis-04 are a collection of mostly minor
stuff, detailed in Appendix J.

No, we don't.

I think this approach is a bad idea. It has been discussed and discarded at
least twice so far on the lists. Maybe third time is the charm.

WHy is it really bad? Well, draft-ietf-sip-guidelines clearly describes why.
THe extension mandates Proxy-Require *and* Require. According to the
guidelines draft:

The Proxy-Require header SHOULD be avoided at all costs. The
          failure likelihood in an individual proxy stays constant, but
          the path failure grows exponentially with the number of hops.

This means that you are going to have an exponentially increasing
probability of needing to fallback to the normal PRACK behavior, and the
resulting cost is that these cell phones, whom you are trying to serve, now
need to implement two already-complex specifications. 

Now, if I ignore the fact that this extension is effectively not backwards
compatible with SIP, there is another problem, which is that it really
doesn't achieve any useful results.

The supposed goal, as outlined in the introduction, is:

  The motivation for defining an alternative approach to [6] is that
   certain networks, e.g. cellular networks, have limited bandwidth
   for signalling purposes. Thus every extra message in the session 
   initiation increases the duration of the session setup, which might 
   cause that the session setup delay crosses the acceptable limit.

This makes no sense to me. I'm assuming that the reliable provisional
responses are being used to acknowledge the 1xx used for manyfolks. Once the
provisional response is received, resource resveration can happen in
PARALLEL with the transmission of PRACK/200, and the final response to the
INVITE can also happen in parallel to that. So, call setup time is not
affected.

Perhaps you are concerned about overhead on the wireless link. In terms of
byte savings, using something like the ROGER protocol or my UDP compression
proposal,
http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt, you
get far, far, far better compression gains than the improvements afforded
from eliminating this message.

So, the SPRACK proposal:

1. necessitates Proxy-Require, which is an effective break in compatibility
with the SIP protocol,
2. doesn't really help call setup times for the manyfolks flows
3. provides tiny compression compared with other alternatives.

So, I do not understand why this is a good path to follow.

I believe that the IPSec compression mechanisms apply to each packet
independently. That is, there is no carryover of compression context from
one IP packet to the next. The problem is that a single SIP message only
compresses a little (maybe 2:1), but when you take advantage of previous
messages to build a compression context, it can be much, much bigger. Thats
the idea behind my draft, and also the others in the ROHC group - ROGER,
SCRIBE. So, I don't see them as solving the same problem.

Simpler, perhaps not (although if you're using PER or BER, its not clear to
me that this is simpler, codewise). But, it totally breaks compatibility
with the existing protocol. By pushing this into a transport problem, it is
isolated to the two entities that need to worry about it.

Thats not clear at all. Either way, we would require new code in
implementations. For a new binary coding, we would be back to square 1, so
that everyone would have to work out the kinks in their encoder/decoders for
every element in the syntax. However, with a shim, we leverage existing,
mature parsers and generators. We add a layer that is not specific to SIP,
so it has no syntax or anything else to get wrong. Its defined by a fairly
simple set of state machines, which should not be that hard to get correct.
I would argue its easier to get that right than it is to get a totally new
encoding of SIP right.

Yes, and that does need to be handled in the protocol.

Well, the problem at hand is really a wireless phone talking to its local
outbound proxy. THus, the phone has only one relationship, and the proxy has
one with each phone it communicates with. This pushes the burden of
compression to the elements that benefit the most from it. From this point
onwards, normal SIP would be used, and so its compatible with existing
proxies and UAs.

The output of the decompressor would need to be monitored.

Hmm. I guess I have to wonder whether the marginal
difference is actually worth much over the base
Huffman encoding and whatever you manage to eek
out with the dictionary across packets. It does
come at the expense of quite a bit of extra shared
state. If you're sold on that, maybe it would be
best of all to just standardize a SIP specific
dictionary :-)

Not that this actually has much to do with
original point...

I don't think it's a good approach to assume that, and the only time one
really could assume that is when the user has control of the outbound
proxy. Also, what stops the user from using SPRACK anyway, even if he
would know the outbound proxy does NOT support it?

The protocol defines ways to find out about the capabilities of nodes,
and I think that those methods should be used.

Hi,

reading bis-03 16.4.1 raises some questions:

"16.4.1 Local outbound proxies
Special considerations exist for local outbound proxies.
A UA which uses a local outbound proxy will send all requests without Route
headers to that proxy. Typically, this includes initial INVITE requests for
a call."

Q: All requests? Doesn't that break record-routing and contradict the rest
of this paragraph? What am I missing?

"If a local outbound proxy wishes to remain on the SIP messaging path for a
call leg, it MUST record-route using the procedures above.
A UA which uses a local outbound proxy, and attempts to send a subsequent
request in a call leg with a route set, SHOULD use the procedures in Section
16.4."

Q: does that mean circumventing the outbound proxy? It does judging from the
next sentence.  Using local outbound is the topic of this paragraph so I
guess this sentence is redundant.

"However, in some instances, a UA may not be capable of DNS, and therefore
may not be able to follow those procedures. In this case, the UA MAY send
the request to its local outbound proxy."
In this case, it MUST NOT remove the top Route header. It sets the
Request-URI to the same value it used for the initial request, and sends it
to its local outbound proxy."

Q: how is a UA (especially one lacking DNS capabilities) supposed to know
that its outbound proxy is record-routing?  The proxy may use in the
Record-Route header a different address than the one the UA knows it by.  

Thanks,
 
Itamar Gilad

Interesting. Any idea what kind of compression ratio we need to aim for, so
that we know how complicated we need to make the solution?

Hmm. I guess I have to wonder whether the marginal
difference is actually worth much over the base
Huffman encoding and whatever you manage to eek
out with the dictionary across packets. It does
come at the expense of quite a bit of extra shared
state. If you're sold on that, maybe it would be
best of all to just standardize a SIP specific
dictionary :-)

Not that this actually has much to do with
original point...

Hi Itamar,

A comment, and related question, to your first question:

>reading bis-03 16.4.1 raises some questions:
> 
>"16.4.1 Local outbound proxies
>Special considerations exist for local outbound proxies.
>A UA which uses a local outbound proxy will send all requests without Route
>headers to that proxy. Typically, this includes initial INVITE requests for
>a call."
> 
>Q: All requests? Doesn't that break record-routing and contradict the rest
>of this paragraph? What am I missing?

Like you wrote, the text says "all requests WITHOUT Route", ie no proxy
has inserted Record-Route.
 
I do have a question related to this, though:

Assume that a remote party sends an INVITE to my client. There are no
proxies in the path, so there will be no Record-Route. There is, of
course, the mandatory Contact header. Then my client answers, and
receives ACK. Nothing strange so far.

Later, my client wants to release the call, so it sends a BYE. My client
is configured to use an outbound proxy, so:

Q: Since there is no Route, shall it send the BYE to the outbound proxy,
or directly to the remote client (defined in the Contact my client
received in the INVITE)?

Q: My understanding of the text is that the BYE should send it to the
outbound proxy. Could someone confirm that? 

Q: Also, could this cause some problem if the outbound proxy is
stateful, since it will receive a BYE it never received an INVITE for?

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can support multi-party
conferencing in many different ways. In this draft, we define the
various multi-party conferencing models, and for each, discuss how
they are used and then analyze their relative benefits and drawbacks.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Session Timer
	Author(s)	: S. Donovan, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt
	Pages		: 28
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). This extension allows for a periodic refresh of SIP
sessions through a re-INVITE. The refresh allows both user agents and
proxies to determine if the SIP session is still active. The
extension defines a new general header, Session-Expires, which

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

	Title		: NAT Friendly SIP

	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-02.txt
	Pages		: 32
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
In this draft, we discuss how SIP can traverse enterprise and
residential firewalls and NATs. This environment is challenging
because we assume here that the end user has little or no control
over the firewall or NAT, and that the firewall or NAT is completely
ignorant of SIP

	Title		: The SIP Supported Header
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne

	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a client to request that a particular protocol extension be
used to process the request. The server declines the request if it
does not support the extension. However, there is currently no way
for a server to determine which extensions are supported by the
client. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the server
to tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define
a way for a client to query a server about the extensions it
supports. This document defines a SIP extension that allows clients
to indicate, in a request, the set of extensions supported. We also
define a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request,
to determine the extensions supported by a server.

If one has high latency link then nothing can be done about it. Compression
is not a solution for that.
If one has low bandwidth link and large data to send then Compression can be
the solution.
SIP messages take up only small portion of the available bandwidth (even on
Cellular links..). Then why use compression for SIP messages? Well..
cellular links have high BER, in this situation it is advisable to have
smaller packets to reduce error probability.. that is why use compression.
.. correct?

Still large number of connections to internet are over telephone modem links
with low bandwidth, comparable with latest cellular links. Isn't it useful
to have end-to-end SIP message compression in that situation?

How much the SIP compression schemes are dependant on RoHC? Could they have
in-built mechanism for configuration negotiation? Should they demand this
facility from lower layers? It seems to me that these schemes work more at
application level and should have configuration negotiation at that level
only. That way they could be easily extened for use on end-to-end rather
than limiting them to hop-to-hop (by depending on RoHC).

I have nagging issue with SIP compression -- compressing and decompressing on 
each proxy server is going to slow down call processing on large networks. 
IMO, it (compression) is not scalable.

Even end-to-end can be a problem if either (or both) UAS and UAC service a 
number of attached SIP-unaware systems. For instance a SIP-PSTN gateway.

Well, obviously you would only compress/decompress where it makes sense.
This would usually be between UA in a cellular host and its outbound proxy.
There you may only have a few kilobits of capacity available (and during the
actual voice call even less), so it is feasible to trade between
transmission delay and processing complexity. So it is a classical
optimization problem with two constraints. Between proxies, where you
(should) have enoungh capacity, compression will probably just slow down
things.

Again, using compression between gateways/controllers probably does not make
sense as the capacity limitations shouldn't be a problem.

We can derive targets from an understanding of the constraints.

Assume a 9.6kbps single-channel GPRS link.

Assume that approximately 5kbps of that is used by a half-rate AMR
(Alternative Minimum Rate) codec. That gives us roughly 4.6kbps available
for processing signaling, such as a re-INVITE, BYE, or new INVITE arriving.

If we have a 1000-byte (8000 bit) messgae over that link, it takes just
under TWO SECONDS (8000/4600) to serialize. That's clearly too long, given
that there might be three messages (or more, with "manyfolks" QoS)  involved
in a call setup.

I haven't seen  a hard design goal for wireless, but I'd guess that a
transaction time of less than 1.5s would be a minimal goal. That means we
need to serialize in less than 500ms. This sets a target compressed message
size of (X/4600)=0.5, or 2300 bits, call it 250 bytes.

In wireline environments, I've seen goals as low as 100ms for three-message
setup. To reach that over GPRS in the above scenario, we'd need to shrink
average message size to  (X/4600)=0.035,  or about 20 bytes. Oddly enough,
this would be roughly equivalent to current GSM signaling.

SIP INVITES  in the Call Flows draft run from 300 to 600 bytes. I doubt
they're representative of real uses, especially with all the additional
stuff people want to put into signaling (cookies, state, cell-IDs,
auth-tokens, blah blah blah).

The three syntactic dictionary transforms (ROGER, SCRIBE, and Rosenburg)
we've seen published are getting on the order of 6 or 8 to 1 compressions,
so they're producing INVITES in the 50 byte range, probably approaching 100
bytes with "real world" messages. This might be good enough for general use.

The best work I've seen so far with LZ-based algorithms  provides roughly
3-1 compression, which might possibly be good enough if one is very terse
with one's messages.

Hi,

A few comments from me.

First, my personal opinion about the binary talk: let's skip the binary
talk. If we start talking about it, we will argue about it for at least
6 months (I think the people who have been involved in the MEGACO work
know what I'm talking about...) Then, IF we would decide to also go
binary, experience (read: MEGACO) has shown that it's not that easy to
define text- and binary rules that "match" 100%. Ok, SIP would probably
be a little easier than Megaco, since we don't have wildcard values etc,
but still. Then we would also have the encoding negotiation problem, and
the issue about which nodes MUST/SHALL/SHOULD support what... And, which
has been mentioned also by others, that we really don't transport that
much information in SIP, so would the gain (not very much, I'd say) be
worth the pain (very much, I'd say)?

Compression is more "flexible". For most networks/architectures I don't
think it will provide very much, but if peope want to use it they are
free to do so - but it would not affect the core protocol.

Then, if we assume that we need compression, we have the other
questions, which I think are more important to discuss:

1. Hop-to-hop vs end-to-end

2. Do we compress the whole message, or only parts of it (the message
body, for example)

3. Compression negotiation

   a) Do we use an external negotiation mechanism, and negotiate before
we start the SIP session. Since the             proxies in many cases
also must be involved in this negotiation we would probably need some
kind of 
      "centralized" function for this.

   b) Do we send the initial INVITE uncompressed (or partly compressed)
with a Supported/Require/Proxy-Require   
      header listing the supported compression algorithms. And again, if
the proxies must support the             compression, there must be a
way for them to indicate it (can be done for example either by
using             Proxy-Require, or some Record-Route parameter)

   c) Do we use "manual" configuration, either by hand or by using some
of the SIP extensions that have been       defined for remote
configuration.


My thoughts...

Actually, it's the serialization latency that seems to cause problems. How
long does it a take a 1KB packet to get through a 4.6kbps link? What are the
impacts of this to a user who's trying to set up a four-way bridge call?

end-to-end compression seems more efficient as it doesn't depend on link
characterictics of link between each hop. A payload compression scheme
should be designed considering worst link characteristics that a packet may
encounter in it's path.. cellular link is a good example for this between
two hops. The gain obtained on those poor links can be carried over to
better links without any loss.
end-to-end scheme becomes more attractive when two disjoint hop-to-hop links
are of poor characteristics.
The processing time on hops could be a issue in hop-to-hop schemes. An
intermediate hop serving multiple connections, if under load, could affect
all connected entities.e.g. a base station serving multiple phones.
(Particularly in payload compression schemes an intermediate hop need not
decompress at all..)
In end-to-end scheme, there is no such problem, resulting in a better
overall performance.


Definitely, this is not applicable in header compression schemes but for
completely different reason, header required for routing. There hop-to-hop
is the best scheme regardless of processing time issue on base station or
any other benefits of end-to-end compression.

Security experts,

my understanding of draft SIP udpcomp is, that the compression occurs on lower protocol layers (as indicated in chapter 2). However, I do not see how this would make sense when assuming that the SIP message to be compressed has been integrity protected and/or possibly encrypted on a SIP application protocol layer above the compression scheme. It is well known that once a message has been encrypted there is no way for compression afterwards; thus, compression must come before encryption. My recommendation is, that the SIP compression scheme be applied before any SIP message security processing takes place.

Ignoring encryption for the moment, how would the UDPcompression scheme perform, when SIP messages were cryptographically integrity protected with a message-dependant hash-code? I could easily imagine, that the piece of hash-code couldn't be compressed significantly. 
If the hash-code negatively impacts the compression performance, then it might at least be wise to skip and not compress the hash-codes. 

There is also question how the compression-protocol with transmission of the context and tokens relates to security? I would rather assume, that at least the WRITE entries deserve the same protection as the SIP message does.

To conclude, I really doubt the statement in section 7, that the compression protocol would not introduce any additional security considerations but see much reasons to further investigate the mentioned issues.

Kind Regards,

Martin Euchner.

Jonathan,

To follow up on my passing comments, it should be
noted that IPsec already has compression
transforms which work in combination with
encryption/message integrity. I'm not sure if TLS
has this capability, but I wouldn't be surprised
(nor do I think it would be hard to add if
not). Thus, there's at least some amount of wheel
reinvention going on here.

That said, it may be interesting to consider
taking the same tack as IPsec compression for SIP
security which has the same problem as all
encryption/compression schemes which is that you
must compress before encrypting to do anything
useful. Thus, it would be natural for secure SIP
headers and bodies (attachments, as I propose) to
allow compression transforms as well.

The synergy between our two drafts, I think, may
lie in something that I've been toying with: the
ability to have a complete SIP application layer
security scheme which not only deals with the
problem which is clearly in the SIP domain (crypto
for parts of the SIP payload), but could also be
used to provide hop-by-hop
encryption/authentication as well negating the
need to require a base level secure transport
mechanism (eg, IPsec, TLS).  I think this is
possible by extending my current proposal to
insert a shim layer much like you propose in this
draft here. I haven't included this in the current
draft (mostly because it's not a baked idea), but
it would make sense to my mind that if we allow
compression, we ought to fold it into the security
framework mainly because of the compress-then-encrypt
problem.

Hi,

Is compression so different from binary encoding?

Our own EPIC scheme uses the BNF description of a protocol to "learn" a
set of binary encodings for the protocol. The compressor then replaces
each text string with its equivalent binary encoding.

It is feasible to write a SIP implementation that uses these binary
encodings directly, missing out the text-based version of the message
altogether. This is not a change to the core protocol, but rather a
combined SIP stack/SIP compressor.

Normally this would be a big amount of effort for very little gain.
However it certainly solves the concerns about processing requirements
(as it doesn't have any!)

Regards,

Richard P

Hi,

A few comments from me.

First, my personal opinion about the binary talk: let's skip the binary
talk. If we start talking about it, we will argue about it for at least
6 months (I think the people who have been involved in the MEGACO work
know what I'm talking about...) Then, IF we would decide to also go
binary, experience (read: MEGACO) has shown that it's not that easy to
define text- and binary rules that "match" 100%. Ok, SIP would probably
be a little easier than Megaco, since we don't have wildcard values etc,
but still. Then we would also have the encoding negotiation problem, and
the issue about which nodes MUST/SHALL/SHOULD support what... And, which
has been mentioned also by others, that we really don't transport that
much information in SIP, so would the gain (not very much, I'd say) be
worth the pain (very much, I'd say)?

Compression is more "flexible". For most networks/architectures I don't
think it will provide very much, but if peope want to use it they are
free to do so - but it would not affect the core protocol.

Then, if we assume that we need compression, we have the other
questions, which I think are more important to discuss:

1. Hop-to-hop vs end-to-end

2. Do we compress the whole message, or only parts of it (the message
body, for example)

3. Compression negotiation

   a) Do we use an external negotiation mechanism, and negotiate before
we start the SIP session. Since the             proxies in many cases
also must be involved in this negotiation we would probably need some
kind of 
      "centralized" function for this.

   b) Do we send the initial INVITE uncompressed (or partly compressed)
with a Supported/Require/Proxy-Require   
      header listing the supported compression algorithms. And again, if
the proxies must support the             compression, there must be a
way for them to indicate it (can be done for example either by
using             Proxy-Require, or some Record-Route parameter)

   c) Do we use "manual" configuration, either by hand or by using some
of the SIP extensions that have been       defined for remote
configuration.


My thoughts...

Hello colleagues,

We submitted a contribution to 3GPP TSG GERAN WG1 and SA WG2 about one year
ago discussing this subject. I attach it as a reference (GP-000508). This
contribution was one of the reasons that some sort of SIP compression was
deemed necessary for UMTS (both GERAN and UTRAN). A snapshot of the results
presented in this contribution can also be found in
"draft-hannu-rohc-signaling-cellular-01.txt", I believe.

For those who do not have time to wade through the details of the
contribution, I summarize some key points below:

(1) Typical post-dial delay (on average) for a GSM circuit-switched call
setup is around 3.5 to 4 seconds. This has proven to be acceptable to a
customer. Anything "consistently" beyond that number becomes
questionable/unacceptable in terms of quality of service.

(2) The analysis in contribution GP-000508 shows that (with an average
compression of 25% to 35% for individual SIP request methods and response
codes accompanied by TCP/IP or UDP/IP header compression), this post-dial
delay number of 3.5 to 4 seconds can only be achieved/approached with the
least robust channel coding schemes (i.e., the least amount of coding ...
including up to no coding at all). This analysis was done for GERAN
(GPRS/EGPRS connected to the UMTS Core Network). Similar results can be
shown for UTRAN (i.e., W-CDMA). Also, even if the customer is willing to
accept longer post-dial delays, we submitted an additional contribution to
3GPP illustrating that the as the duration of calls becomes shorter on
average, the number of calls that can be supported per busy hour in a cell
decreases rapidly vs. GSM circuit-switched as the post-dial delay increases.
Therefore, a greater SIP compression ratio is required (via some form of
delta-compression as discussed, for example, in ROGER (see
draft-hannu-rohc-roger-01.txt).

(3) The open issue is where to place the compressor/decompressor pair and
how to negotiate the SIP compression/decompression scheme. The
compressor/decompressor scheme can be place either in (1) the mobile
station/client and the SIP proxy server; or (2) the mobile station/client
and the radio network controller. NOTE: The terms mobile station and radio
network controller can be exchanged with link layer compression or
node-to-node compression for those who do not like the idea of a "cellular
specific" argument.

In the case of (2), encryption (among other things) becomes an issue.
Therefore, if possible, solution (1) would be preferred. If solution (1) is
agreed upon, then perhaps a new layer between SIP and TCP and/or UDP is a
viable approach to designing the negotiation mechanism (e.g., something
similar to what was done for https via SSL/TLS). The Internet draft
"draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt" is a start in this direction (to
some degree) but it lacks the signaling necessary for context update,
context feedback, and context repair at this point in time.

If one has high latency link then nothing can be done about it. Compression
is not a solution for that.
If one has low bandwidth link and large data to send then Compression can be
the solution.
SIP messages take up only small portion of the available bandwidth (even on
Cellular links..). Then why use compression for SIP messages? Well..
cellular links have high BER, in this situation it is advisable to have
smaller packets to reduce error probability.. that is why use compression.
.. correct?

Still large number of connections to internet are over telephone modem links
with low bandwidth, comparable with latest cellular links. Isn't it useful
to have end-to-end SIP message compression in that situation?

How much the SIP compression schemes are dependant on RoHC? Could they have
in-built mechanism for configuration negotiation? Should they demand this
facility from lower layers? It seems to me that these schemes work more at
application level and should have configuration negotiation at that level
only. That way they could be easily extened for use on end-to-end rather
than limiting them to hop-to-hop (by depending on RoHC).

<TITLE>RE: [rohc] Re: [Sip] SIP Compression</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello colleagues,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>We submitted a contribution to 3GPP TSG GERAN WG1 and =
SA WG2 about one year ago discussing this subject. I attach it as a =
reference (GP-000508). This contribution was one of the reasons that =
some sort of SIP compression was deemed necessary for UMTS (both GERAN =
and UTRAN). A snapshot of the results presented in this contribution =
can also be found in =
&quot;draft-hannu-rohc-signaling-cellular-01.txt&quot;, I =
believe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>For those who do not have time to wade through the =
details of the contribution, I summarize some key points below:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>(1) Typical post-dial delay (on average) for a GSM =
circuit-switched call setup is around 3.5 to 4 seconds. This has proven =
to be acceptable to a customer. Anything &quot;consistently&quot; =
beyond that number becomes questionable/unacceptable in terms of =
quality of service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>(2) The analysis in contribution GP-000508 shows that =
(with an average compression of 25% to 35% for individual SIP request =
methods and response codes accompanied by TCP/IP or UDP/IP header =
compression), this post-dial delay number of 3.5 to 4 seconds can only =
be achieved/approached with the least robust channel coding schemes =
(i.e., the least amount of coding ... including up to no coding at =
all). This analysis was done for GERAN (GPRS/EGPRS connected to the =
UMTS Core Network). Similar results can be shown for UTRAN (i.e., =
W-CDMA). Also, even if the customer is willing to accept longer =
post-dial delays, we submitted an additional contribution to 3GPP =
illustrating that the as the duration of calls becomes shorter on =
average, the number of calls that can be supported per busy hour in a =
cell decreases rapidly vs. GSM circuit-switched as the post-dial delay =
increases. Therefore, a greater SIP compression ratio is required (via =
some form of delta-compression as discussed, for example, in ROGER (see =
draft-hannu-rohc-roger-01.txt).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>(3) The open issue is where to place the =
compressor/decompressor pair and how to negotiate the SIP =
compression/decompression scheme. The compressor/decompressor scheme =
can be place either in (1) the mobile station/client and the SIP proxy =
server; or (2) the mobile station/client and the radio network =
controller. NOTE: The terms mobile station and radio network controller =
can be exchanged with link layer compression or node-to-node =
compression for those who do not like the idea of a &quot;cellular =
specific&quot; argument.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In the case of (2), encryption (among other things) =
becomes an issue. Therefore, if possible, solution (1) would be =
preferred. If solution (1) is agreed upon, then perhaps a new layer =
between SIP and TCP and/or UDP is a viable approach to designing the =
negotiation mechanism (e.g., something similar to what was done for =
https via SSL/TLS). The Internet draft =
&quot;draft-rosenberg-rohc-sip-udpcomp-00.txt&quot; is a start in this =
direction (to some degree) but it lacks the signaling necessary for =
context update, context feedback, and context repair at this point in =
time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Still large number of connections to internet are =

</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>How much the SIP compression schemes are dependant on =

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIP is not intended to transport large amounts =
of information.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; That plus the ratio of bandwidth used by =
signalling vs.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the bandwidth used by the media, means that =
signalling compression</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; for SIP is not in general a problem. It only =
really becomes a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; problem on low bandwidth, high latency *links* =
such as a cellular</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; link where sometimes every byte counts.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; In short, I believe signalling compression is a =
hop-by-hop</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; problem and not an end-to-end one. A hop-by-hop =
solution seems</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; appropriate in this case.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; It should also be noted that you can always =
apply gzip compression</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to the MIME body of a SIP message to achieve =
some end-to-end</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; compression. IMHO, this is not needed.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I believe the compression techniques that have =
been</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; described so far (ROGER, SCRIBE, EPIC, etc.) =
are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; fairly generic and would work well on a variety =
of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; link types. Some have been tailored with =
cellular</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; in mind.</FONT>

That is definitely one thing we need to investigate.
To summarize, we have three kinds of data that can
be used for compression:

1) static and protocol specific
2) user specific
3) dynamic

I'm not sure the difference between using 1) only
and using all of them is marginal. At least the 
user specific part can boost compression efficiency
significantly. 

Below are some results copied from Appendix A of SCRIBE-01. 

Scenario A: each message is compressed individually
Scenario B: 2) is used
Scenario C: 1) and 2) are used

Thanks for your feedback.

Yes, we were thinking about Supported header as well.

However, we found some reasons against _redefining_ the Supported header
field:

- In a standard we'd need a clear separation of _User_Agent_supported_ and
_proxy_supported_ features. This to keep the protocol flexible and logical.

- Some features would only need support in the UA, whereas some would
require also support by proxies. There would need to be a way to distinguish
between the two as is the case with the separation of Require and
Proxy-Require. For example 100rel would only be a Supported tag, while
s100rel (as we proposed), would be a Proxy-Supported one.

In principle, this would be one way to go.
But we were thinking about implementations, which either encrypt or remove
the Record-Route header field(s) from the Request and store them locally, as
e.g. 3GPP wireless networks do. (This is not nice, but the chances are we
have to live with it.) If this is the case, a proxy server would have to
evaluate all the rr-entries (including its own) and put the result into its
own rr-entry. Such an entry would not look anymore logical, as it is a
mixture of "its own" entry and the entries it encrypts or removes.
Furthermore, in case, there are many features listed in Proxy-Supported and
many proxy servers, the message length increases quite much.

Using the approach described in the I-D, after one proxy server removes an
entry from Proxy-Supported (or the whole field), the UAS and the following
proxy servers do not have to care anymore about the whole issue. This can
save some time, if there are many proxy servers in a signalling path.

Megaco is a protocol with binary and text encodings.
The binary is BER encoded, and there are exactly equivalent
ASN.1 and ABNF descriptions of the encodings to match the
protocol text.  The results we have so far suggest that message
length of binary encoding is larger than the text encoding
for the same message.  This isn't speculation, it's what we
measure when you take an implementation that has both encodings
and look at the message lengths.

If you simply use binary encodings for the basic syntactic
constructs, you will get negative compression.  The compression
available comes from dealing with the contents of the
values, not the basic method/header constructs.

Hello,

I just found out that the new version of SCRIBE I-D has been 
put into the IETF repository, though no announcement appeared on
the mailing list.

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liu-rohc-scribe-01.txt

Please take a look and it may help the current discussion on this
issue.

Br,
Zhigang

No, you are correct. The bit about record-routing is unchanged from the -01
version, where this was needed. Now, if the proxy is contacting a user
behind a full-cone nat, it isn't needed.

Oops! My bad. I meant to say RTP/AVP, not RTP/UDP. My apologies. It is
supposed to be interoperable in this way as you have described. The UAC
sends an INVITE, and lists RTP/AVP with the port and IP address it wishes to
receive on. If its supporting symmetric RTP, it includes a direction. Lets
say it wishes to be active. So, it includes:

a=direction:active

And it is still prepared to receive media on the IP/port it listed. Lets say
this hits a UAS which doesn't support symmetric RTP. In this case, the SDP
in the response doesn't include a direction attribute, and if there is no
nat, the UAC gets media on the IP and port it placed into the INVITE. Now,
if the UAS does support symmetric RTP, it returns in the response the IP and
port, with RTP/AVP as the transport, and then indicates a direction of
passive. When the UAC sees this, it begins sending RTP to the IP/port in the
200 OK, and then prepares to receive media on the socket it sent RTP from.

Right! And that was the whole idea, but I fouled it up by putting UDP
instead of AVP into the example SDP. Thanks for pointing it out, Robert.

It seems like failure of this approach is assured if a new token (one not in
the BNF) is encountered. SIP has lots of those. In the "compression"
systems, the new token is still transported correctly, but may not be
optimally compressed.

The problem is that hop-by-hop and end-to-end mean different things to
different people.

There are SIP hops and IP hops.

IP hops are between IP devices (hosts and routers) , and a stop at an
application node like a SIP proxy represents the start of an entirely
seperate IP route.

SIP hops are between SIP nodes like UAs and proxies.

So for example:

UA->rtr->rtr->rtr->proxy

is 4 IP hops and one SIP hop.

There's no reason for the routers to compress/decompress SIP information.
They do need to decompress IP headers to do IP routing, but they don't look
at the SIP stuff at all.

UA->rtr->proxy->rtr->ua is two SIP hops, each with two IP hops. Here, the
proxy in the middle needs to decompress the SIP in order to make a SIP-level
routing decision..

When an IP person says end-to-end, they mean the source UA compresses, the
proxy decompresses and recompresses, and the destination UA decompresses.

A SIP person says end-to-end, they mean the source UA compresses and the
destination UA decompresses. That only works if there is no proxy in the
middle.

So, the SIP-specific compression protocols under discussion (like
Rosenburg's) tend to be hop-by-hop at a SIP level, and end-to-end at an IP
level.

Hi,

Just a small detail/cosmetic/clarification question:

The 505 SIP Version not supported, which belongs to the Server Error
category, response code is used when a request with a non-supported SIP
version (other than SIP/2.0, that is) is received.

The ABNF grammar (bis-04, page 27), however, allows ONLY "SIP/2.0". If
something else is received, isn't it then, from a grammar point of view,
a Syntax Error (ie a 4xx response code should be used)?

So, if we want to use 505, shouldn't the grammar look something like:

SIP-Version = "SIP/2.0" | other-version
other-version = "SIP/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

...or something similar.

Hi,

The compression ratio depends on how the binary encodings are
obtained. BER is not designed for efficiency and will most
likely produce binary encodings that are even longer than their
text equivalents.

In contrast, schemes like EPIC and Lempel-Ziv are designed
specifically to convert text strings into shorter binary
equivalents. Both schemes use Huffman compression for this task,
which on its own would get a compression ratio of about 1.2:1.
Compression is further improved by introducing a new binary
encoding that means "text is same as a previous text string".

It's debatable whether this should be called "binary encoding" or
not. However I stick by my original point (that you can implement
a combined SIP stack/SIP compressor to lower the overall processing
requirements).

Out of curiosity, what was the motivation for doing MEGACO
as both text and binary?

Regards,

Richard P

Megaco is a protocol with binary and text encodings.
The binary is BER encoded, and there are exactly equivalent
ASN.1 and ABNF descriptions of the encodings to match the
protocol text.  The results we have so far suggest that message
length of binary encoding is larger than the text encoding
for the same message.  This isn't speculation, it's what we
measure when you take an implementation that has both encodings
and look at the message lengths.

If you simply use binary encodings for the basic syntactic
constructs, you will get negative compression.  The compression
available comes from dealing with the contents of the
values, not the basic method/header constructs.

Hi,

We solved the "new token" problem by having a binary version of every ASCII
character. If there is a binary version of the whole token then we send that,
otherwise we send the binary versions of each individual character.

It seems like failure of this approach is assured if a new token (one not in
the BNF) is encountered. SIP has lots of those. In the "compression"
systems, the new token is still transported correctly, but may not be
optimally compressed.

Hi,

Somehow, I feel we're drifting away from the real issue.
First of all, the need of SIP compression arises only 
because a SIP user is connected to the rest of world via 
a bandwidth limited link (e.g. cellular). Otherwise, we 
won't make all the mess to compress SIP, which negates
all the reasons why SIP is text based in the first place.

Therefore, I think a compression between the SIP user and
a SIP proxy on the other side of the low-bandwidth link
is a reasonable approach. Note that this is neither hop-by-hop,
nor end-to-end (I assume by e2e you mean the two end SIP 
users, not including the proxies).

This solves the problem where it arises, with no effect to
the rest of networks. Specifically, a "normal" SIP user with
fast connection does not need to have the compression function,
nor does it have to determine if the peer SIP user is a mobile
or not. 

As to the extra load on SIP proxy performing the compression, I 
don't think it is a problem as Markus indicated. Furthermore, the 
function needs to be there anyway since the proxy needs uncompressed
(at least part of) SIP messages.

Br,
Zhigang

Hi

Well I for one am glad the Authentication-Info is now mentioned in the spec,
that makes my digest draft actually potentially useful!! It would be nice
however to have the header mentioned in section 10, even if it's just a short
entry like Authorization.

Thanks for the numbers. What needs to be taken
into account also is the recidivism rate. Sharing
state with a first hop proxy is quite likely to
get good compression, while direct communication
with another UA is more likely to degrade into the
individually compressed case since there won't be
that much signaling, typically. Also: there's an
interesting question of dictionary/window
sizes. Gzip, as I recall, uses a 32k window to do
its magic, which is a pretty hefty amount of
memory. I'd be worried about both the UA if it
needed quite a few of these, as well as large
proxies which need to subtend 10-100's of
thousands of UA's. You could, I suppose, set the
window size down, but I'm sure the ratios are
non-linear.  Guestimating with the two points on
the graph given your numbers (always a dangerous
thing to do :-), the sweet spot is still likely to
be in the 8k range, or so which is still a fair
amount of state to be dragging around.

And as always, introduction of state always
reduces your flexibility since there's a higher
energy barrier to surmount when moving. This, of
course, runs afoul of load balancing schemes
which like statelessness generally. Given security
state considerations, they may already be on the
losing end, but it's worth noting the cost.

Hi,

Just a small detail/cosmetic/clarification question:

The 505 SIP Version not supported, which belongs to the Server Error
category, response code is used when a request with a non-supported SIP
version (other than SIP/2.0, that is) is received.

The ABNF grammar (bis-04, page 27), however, allows ONLY "SIP/2.0". If
something else is received, isn't it then, from a grammar point of view,
a Syntax Error (ie a 4xx response code should be used)?

So, if we want to use 505, shouldn't the grammar look something like:

SIP-Version = "SIP/2.0" | other-version
other-version = "SIP/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

...or something similar.

Hi,

A small idea...

We now have a number of SIP extensions, defined in separate drafts, and
things like compression and security will also be outside the core bis
document. This way is very good and flexible, and the bis doesn't have
to be changed every time there is a change elsewhere.

I have been thinking of this before, and it came back now when the early
media draft was released: why not make the whole SIP media handling as a
separate draft? Some advantages I see:

1. Today we have SDP, tomorrow maybe SDPng, so we still would have to
write a separate document for that, or update the RFC2543 again.

2. Annex B is IP specific, even IPv4 specific, so we still will have to
write separate documents how SIP uses SDP for IPv6 bearers/ATM
bearers/whatever-future bearers (I KNOW there allready are separate
documents some of these).

3. It would be possible to go into the handling of EACH media- and
bearer type much more in detail.

4. All media handling, including services like call hold, media
modification and early media, would be in the same document.

I know that doing this is not very high on the priority list, but I also
don't think that it would take very much time (to start with, we only
have to cut-paste Annex B...:).

Just an idea. Comments?

Ps. I think that doing this would also make things more clear for those
who still think that SIP is a protocol used to transport media :)

Dean, let's do a reality check. We are constantly receiving requests to
tweak our TCP stack in order to match the long delays of GPRS channels
-- more than 600 ms is not uncommon. These delays seem to be intrinsic
to the technology, probably due to a mix of contention on access and low
level retransmission. Do you really believe that you are going to
conduct a meaningful VoIP conversation over this kind of channel?

By "direct communication with another UA", do you
mean the compression is not done at the first hop
proxy, or some SIP messages may not go through
the proxy? We have been assuming that the first hop
proxy of a mobile UA (yes, I take cellular as an example) 
is on the path of all SIP messages sent by and to
the mobile UA. This is not true in general, but I
think it can be configured that way for the purpose
of compression.

Also, those numbers were measured without the use of
dynamic dictionary. Only static and user specific 
data are used. The former doesn't need any signaling. 
The latter only needs to be populated once (to wherever
the other compression point is).

That's our concerns too and that's why we also
used the very simple lzss.c for comparison. Just 
to highlight some quick facts (they can be found
in Appendix A in SCRIBE-01):

- Static dictionary: 243 bytes
- user specific dictionary: 640 bytes
- lzss.c: ring buffer = 2 KBytes, 
          pointer = (11-bit position, 5-bit length)

For such a humble configuration, a compression ratio
about 5:1 (compared to gzip 6.xx:1) is pretty good.

What we see is different capabilities of UAs (e.g.
a cell phone vs.. a laptop) as well as the proxy. 
SCRIBE tries to address the issue by a framework
that is scalable and flexible. It allows different 
compression algorithms and different compression
data synchronization mechanisms. I believe the static
and user-specific data, coupled with a simple compression
algorithm, is a good starting point. From there,
we can add dynamic and more powerful compression
algorithm if we can afford the complexity.

Yes, that's why we propose the SIP proxy as the
other compression point. The mobile UA won't change
its proxy often. Even if the state transfer is needed, 
the extra vost is not that high considering all the 
state queries/transfers already needed in current 
cellular networks. (And you're right, as a law
of physics, you need more energy to be moble. :-))

Hi,

A small idea...

We now have a number of SIP extensions, defined in separate drafts, and
things like compression and security will also be outside the core bis
document. This way is very good and flexible, and the bis doesn't have
to be changed every time there is a change elsewhere.

I have been thinking of this before, and it came back now when the early
media draft was released: why not make the whole SIP media handling as a
separate draft? Some advantages I see:

1. Today we have SDP, tomorrow maybe SDPng, so we still would have to
write a separate document for that, or update the RFC2543 again.

2. Annex B is IP specific, even IPv4 specific, so we still will have to
write separate documents how SIP uses SDP for IPv6 bearers/ATM
bearers/whatever-future bearers (I KNOW there allready are separate
documents some of these).

3. It would be possible to go into the handling of EACH media- and
bearer type much more in detail.

4. All media handling, including services like call hold, media
modification and early media, would be in the same document.

I know that doing this is not very high on the priority list, but I also
don't think that it would take very much time (to start with, we only
have to cut-paste Annex B...:).

Just an idea. Comments?

Ps. I think that doing this would also make things more clear for those
who still think that SIP is a protocol used to transport media :)

The concept sounds great, but this could be quite an operation and the
timing might be an issue right now. And while allowing for SDPng is
good, we also run the risk of ending up at a point where we might allow
for all kinds of SDP replacement candidates which could create more
interoperability islands over time.=20

If we take this approach, let's make sure we're convinced the reward
outweighs the risks. If so, I'm all for it.

Store and forward speech messaging delivered on a one-to-many basis, aka
"group voice chat" is a potential application over high-latency networks
like GPRS/GERAN. Real-time two-way may be problematic for the first
generation of systems, but GPRS/UTRAN should be much better. Maybe the real
wireless wonks (I'm not one!) can shed some light . . .

And I think the latency problem is derived from the way that TDM applies,
wherein the mobile waits for a request slot, requests a slot to talk in,
waits for a response telling it which slot to use, and then waits for the
slot to occur. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody comes up with an
isochronous model akin to the DOCSYS "unsolicited grant" that will work
nicely for VoIP.

Jonathan,

I may have missed something, but I feel that there may be limitations to
the proposed scheme. I am unable to see how 2 SIP devices behind the
same NAT device are going to communicate with each other.

A secondary issue is that you would be exposing private IP addresses
on the outside.

In the port sharing (on the AVT mailing list) case, with a VPN like
tunnel, local calling (2 sip devices behind the same NAT) may require
sending all packets across the WAN link and back.

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your comments! A small clarification, though.

I did not mean that we have to include SDPng from the beginning - I
think it's enough to start with SDP. SDPng, and whatever other SDP
"replacements" that may come up in future, can be added later, or
written in separate drafts. The point is that it wouldn't affect the
core SIP specification (ie RFC2543).

Regards,

Hi

When can the UAS and the UAC send the info request. Can the UAS send it before
sending a 200 ok or can the UAC send it before sending an ACK or before
getting a final respomse.

Is the following scenarios valid

A -------------> B
    invite

A <--------------B
       180

A <------------- B
       info

A--------------->B
      info

A  <--------------B
         200 ok

A-------------->B
  ACK

Hi,

In the bis draft A regular transaction is defined as a transaction other than
that of an ACK, INVITE, CANCEL. So I infer that an INFO is a regular
transaction.

Now. if a regular transaction is in progress, ie if a UAC has initiated an INFO
request then if the response to the INFO request has not yer arrived can the
UAC issue a BYE request. if yes what happens to the INFO request.

Also if an UAC has sent an INFO request(1) can it also send another INFO
request (2) before getting the repsonse for the first INFO request(1).

if this allowed then what should be the behaviour of the UAS if the second
request arrives before the first one,as the CSEQ of the second INFO will e
higher than the first one, which means the ordering of the CSEQ is affected.

I am sorry if such issues have already been disucussed before, even pointers to
those discussion will be helpful

Thanks and Regards
Hrishikesh Saria

Hi,

There are three wireless network scenarios I know of where SIP is intended
to be used and where compression is either helpful or even critical.

1) GPRS as discussed below, which already exists to some extent and will
probably start properly within the next 6 months, as handsets should be
available in volume.

As Christian says VoIP is probably out of question for GPRS, as GPRS causes
delay in addition to the theoretical bit transmission time, and the
realistic capacities will initially be around 10-20 kbps. However, things
like SIP-based presence and messaging should be completely doable for GPRS,
and any reduction of transmission time would be nice. And perhaps people
start to use some form of semi-real-time stuff as well, who knows.

=> So, this is mainly an optimization.

2) WCDMA (UMTS, 3GPP) and CDMA2000 (3GPP2) which will be available within
the next couple of years to some extent.

Here VoIP will be possible, what comes to available radio capacity and
latency, as long as IP QoS (DiffServ) can be mapped to the actual radio
bearers. As WCDMA is quite flexible the required amount of capacity can be
applied e.g. for SIP based on traditional IP traffic classification.
However, in my understanding it is not very nice to keep capacity allocated,
even though you are not using it (as would be with SIP, which is very bursty
in nature). Also call setup with PRACK and COMET (and Privacy-headers etc.)
is quite heavy and requires several round trips. Thus, it is desirable to
have as small messages as possible.

=> It seems that compression would be a big optimization!

3) GERAN/GSM with header stripping

This means that it looks like VoIP (the core network is normal IP), but
actually the voice frames/packets are carried over the air as
circuit-switched, using the channel coding for the voice codec. SIP is
carried using the signalling channels originally provisioned for GSM
signaling, so they are quite narrow. Especially during the speech call
itself, part of the signalling capacity is obtained by stealing bits from
the speech channels.

These kind of hybrid systems are really complex, but they are also very
efficient, and a lot of legacy stuff in the radio can be utilized. 

=> It seems that in these kind of environments compression will be really
critical to get the call setup times tolerable.

This is true if you assume that the support for a feature is a random
variable. However, it could also be possible to deploy a new feature in
proxies by implementing it in islands of proxies such as ones serving
wireless hosts.

This is a valid point unless the wireless-serving proxies would in most
cases support SPRACK. However, what I have heard, SIP implementation in
phone is not as big issue as delays are.

Yes, call setup delays and wireless link overhead would be the main
motivation for trying to reduce the number of messages/bytes needed. It's
true that QoS setup & radio bearer establishment can start right at the same
time as PRACK is being sent and 200 OK for it is being waited for.

However, especially if compression is not used, we have calculated that
PRACK-200 RTT takes actually longer than QoS setup in some of the wireless
systems (read GERAN) that we are dealing with. So, that is the constraint. I
agree it may not be a big difference, and if compression is being
standardized, as I really hope, your argumentation is correct.

There is still another issue. What if 200 OK for PRACK or any other SIP
message is lost? That causes a retransmission, and the call setup delay
becomes larger. Following the reasoning you had above about the proxies, the
likelihood of loss grows exponentially with the number of messages. 

> So, the SPRACK proposal:

The extension COULD be used with Proxy-Require,
however in the I-D we propose the usage of _Proxy-Supported_,
(as described in draft-hoeneisen-sip-proxy-supported-00.txt)
which means, that the call can be set-up with the first
INIVITE and depending, whether all record routing proxy
servers support the s100rel, either the s100rel or the
100rel mechanisms are applied, i.e. no 420 Bad Extension
for s100rel is sent by any proxy server.
There will be no path failures with this proposal.

> 2. doesn't really help call setup times for the manyfolks flows

In some cases it does, as explained above. I agree that compression is more
important, though.

OK.

> So, I do not understand why this is a good path to follow.

IF it was possible to redo SIP, would Provisional Responses/PRACK be done
differently? I guess so. Our proposal is one way, and it provides backwards
compatibility with a fallback system. I don't know if there ever will be
SIPv3...

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Session Timer
	Author(s)	: S. Donovan, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-05.txt
	Pages		: 28
	Date		: 24-Jul-01
	
This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). This extension allows for a periodic refresh of SIP
sessions through a re-INVITE. The refresh allows both user agents and
proxies to determine if the SIP session is still active. The
extension defines a new general header, Session-Expires, which
conveys the lifetime of the session.

ther first paragraph of chapter 16 of bis-03 says:

Record routing is the process whereby a proxy server can request to
receive all messages between two UAs for a particular call leg. The
proxy accomplishes this by inserting a header, called Record-Route into
the initial request that begins the call leg. The user agents use these
headers to construct a set of Route headers, that gets inserted into
subsequent requests in the call leg. The Route headers contain a set of
proxies that the request must visit on its way from one UA to
another. Proxies use these to forward the requests, much like strict IP
source routing.

the above is not true, since if an invite arrives at the uas with only
one proxy listed in the record-route, according to 16.2 the route-set
contains

uri-from-the-record-route
uri-from-the-contact

when the uas then sends a bye, according to 16.4 the request-uri will
contain the uri of the proxy that inserted the record-route and the
route header will contain the uri of the contact:

The request is constructed as specified in Section 15.4. The UA then
takes the list of URI in the route set. The top URI is inserted into the
request URI of the request, including all parameters. Any URI parameters
not allowed in the request URI MUST then be stripped. Each of the
remaining URIs (if any) from the route set, including all URI
parameters, are placed into a Route header into the request, in order.

as the result, the route header of the bye will not contain uri of the
the record-routing proxy as the first paragraph claims.

one could say that the first paragraph just gives an overall idea of
what happens and is not intended as an accurate description.  the
problem, however, seems to be more than editorial, since if the uas is
using another proxy to route its requests, this other proxy will route
the bye according to 16.5 as follows:

When a proxy receives a request, it MUST check for the existence of a
Route header. If one exists, it MUST pop that Route header, and place it
(including all URI parameters) into the Request-URI.

in this case the request-uri contains the uri of the proxy, but since
there is also a route header containing the contact uri, this other
proxy will forget the request-uri and route the bye directly to the uac
that originally sent the invite.  as the result, the very idea of the
record-routing proxy wanting to be on the path of subsequent requests
gets lost.

section 16.4.1 talks about UAs and outbound proxies, but i don't see
that the text would change what i described above, since the main rule
still is:

A UA which uses a local outbound proxy, and attempts to send a subequent
request in a call leg with a route set, SHOULD use the procedures in
Section 16.4.

the rest of the section seems to apply only to dns uncapable UAs.

what is the point that i'm missing here?

Some comments as requested:
- The title of the draft in the page headers appears mangled to me. 
It also doesn't match the published name 
(draft-campbell-sip-e164-00.txt).

- Section 'User Agent Client' says "A UAC that is configured to 
use a local outbound proxy SHOULD not use enum." This could use 
a SHOULD NOT.

- On the editors note about including text re: interpreting the 
NAPTR RRs. I can't see what needs to be added beyond RFC 2916.

- Application Examples: E.164 as a Universal Identifier. The editor 
identifies this as a somewhat ill advised thing to do so other 
examples would be preferable. Would an example of how a 1800 
number could be mapped on to an IP endpoint in a SIP network 
be a better example?

- Reference [1] has moved on from an ID to RFC 2916.

- On a personal level I was left wondering what this draft 
really says beyond that SIP entities can try to use DNS to 
resolve E.164 numbers. The how this works is dealt with by 
RFC 2916 and I am not sure what really can be said about the 
why and when this is done. Not that the draft doesn't offer 
sensible advice but the decision ultimately seems to be a 
local policy decision. 

One thing that could have added interest would have been some 
info on how TRIP may relate to routing to E.164 numbers on SIP 
networks. If there is more than one path open for making the 
routing decision precedence may need specifying. There is a 
draft on ENUM, SIP URIs, TRIP, and Gateways: 
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ymbk-enum-trip-00.txt
A reference or even some closer co-operation between the 
authors may be of interest.

Cheers,
Neil.

I agree that any text (or BER) protocol is compressible using
techniques that recognize repetition of sequences.  SIP is especially
sensitive to anything that detects repeated domain names.

Megaco has both text and binary because there were two camps
who could not agree.  The binary camp was convinced that 
their encoding would be significantly smaller and faster.
In order to avoid a split, and thus two close, but not identical
protocols, we compromised.  I actually proposed, and at one
point had agreement on a coin toss!  The coin was tossed,
and it came out text.  The binary folks succeeded in overturning
the agreement on the coin toss.  Thus we have both. Around 95%
of implementations so far are text only.

The problem that leaps out at me here is that a Redirect Server
that knows nothing of this extension will not return the cookie,
which would be interpreted as a deletion with this logic.  This
doesn't seem desirable.  Also, the draft seems to indicate that
this behaviour be extended to classes other than 3xx.  The
moment we break out of 3xx, it seems to me that deciding whether
a SIP Server is a Redirect Server or not becomes a little
less clear.

How about looking at the response to see if it has a Cookie
header in?  If it doesn't, then the Redirect Server either
doesn't understand the extension or doesn't care.  If it does
have a header, then this could be taken as the updated list
of Cookies to use.  This would require a slight change to the
grammar to allow no Cookies (so that all could be deleted),
but that doesn't seem too offensive.

Cheers,


 - Jo.

SIP does not assume a closed universe. I would like for those wireless
handsets to be able to call wireline SIP phones supported by existing SIP
proxies. Your proposal will require all record-routing proxies to support
this extension, including ones outside of the "wireless islands".

There are something like 4 drafts on the subject of sip compression within
the rohc group. I plan on attending the meeting to argue that this work be
taken up as a standards track item somewhere, probably rohc. Without that,
there will be a MILLION proposals for a vagary of "improvements to sip for
wireless performance", which will all ultimately kill sip interoperability
and get performance improvements only by by slowly and painfully hacking up
the protocol in ways much like you propose. A middle-layer compression gives
tremendous benefits in terms of compression and wireless performance without
killing the protocol. The cost is a moderate increase in complexity, and I
feel that is well justified.

This is no different in what you are proposing. You still need
retransmissions for reliability. In your case, what if the 1xx is lost? Or
the PRACK is lost? Same difference.

Well, you are adding even more complexity and mess with this
Proxy-Supported, just to support this one thing which buys you something
like 5% improvement in bandwidth usage and questionable improvements in
latency. This is what I mean about lots of hacks to the protocol, cutting it
to pieces until it dies....

If I could do SIP over from scratch, I would change many, many things, not
the least of which was reliability of provisional responses. But, we have no
such luxury.

Hi,

Thanks for the comments.  You are right, I have incremented both the version
and the session fields in the SDP - I should keep the session field the same.

Thanks,
Alan Johnston

No, they're not the same. The WRITE HIGH REFERECE appears on the top of page
9. So, WRITE REFERENCE is:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |1|   index     |1|1|0|   TC    | tokens..
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

and WRITE HIGH REFERENCE is:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |1|   index     |0|1|1| index   |x|x|x|   TC    |  tokens
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Yes, I had thought about usage of static codebooks, which is used in one of
the other proposals. I think its probably a good idea. 

The draft I wrote up is not really meant to be a complete solution, and I
expect the final compression work will be a synthesis of many of the fine
ideas in SCRIBE, ROGER, EPIC, and this proposal. My main goals with this
were to emphasize some key points:

1. this is the BEST way to solve the problem for wireless usage of SIP
2. the protocol is best viewed as a mechanism for maintenance and management
of codebooks, and that allowing different compression algorithms within that
framework is a good thing
3. There are reasonable ways to handle compression of out of order messages
that must be taken into account.
4. The mechanism, from a SIP perspective, is best done at the "transport
layer", in the sense that its something for which SRV record-entries are
defined, and a SIP transport param is defined, so that the existing
transport negotiation mechanisms in SIP can be applied. 

Looking forward to discussing it all in London....

As Dean has indicated, its the latency that becomes an issue. The amount of
time it takes to send a large message can impact post dial delay and other
related metrics.

I think there is some confusion over e2e vs. hBh. The proposed compression
scheme is, based on the SIP meaning, hop by hop, because its between a SIP
client and its proxy. In the IP stack, this is end to end, since it occurs
between application entities that send messages directly to each other over
an IP network. The SIP compression proposal is NOT a link-layer compression
mechanism, as ROHC itself is.

The proposed compression scheme does not depend on ROHC, nor does it depend
on lower layers (IP or below) in any way. Negotiation of usage of the scheme
is done at the SIP layer.

The idea with the proposal (and, BTW, SIP Compression is a misnomer since
the mechanism, like everyone elses, is not application specific. I called
the draft Compression of SIP to draw the SIP community's attention to this
kind of approach as the preferred solution) is that the application layer
protocol already has its own reliability and handshake messages. So, there
would be some kind of API interface between the sip layer and the transport,
which the sip layer would use to inform the transport when a message has
been acknowledged.

The benefit is message overhead reduction and simplicity, at the cost of
requiring a small amount of support from the application (sip) to support
the transport. Is it worth it? Maybe, maybe not. I am not particularly
religious on this, and my goal was to just keep it simple.

Yes, exactly. I am not proposing a new tranport protocol that needs to be
signaled within IP (peer to UDP, TCP), but rather something that SIP
considers a transport protocol. This means that we can have SRV records of
the form:

_sip._cudp.foo.com

which would identify servers for foo.com providing SIP over this transport
(Compressed UDP, or whatever we call it). We can also have a SIP URL
transport param:

sip:jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com;transport=cudp

which can be used in record-routing, for example.

The following is a very good way to proceed. I share the same
view as yours (need to do some homework on point 4 to understand
the details). It is also important that we can proceed fast to meet
3GPP schedule. Otherwise, we will all spend 20 or more seconds 
listening to the ring each time we make a SIP call.

It seems like what you are really talking about is a static dictionary based
on a study of the BNF of the protocol. I suspect that you could probably
hand tune a static dictionary to be even better based on knowledge of what
actually comes in a SIP message in real scenarios. I still think a dynamic
dictionary ontop of a static one like you propose is even better, any my
initial tests gave me 8:1 compression, far better than anything reported
with pure static (and I will note that this was with an LZW variant; if you
pay the compute overhead of LZSS it will really rock, but I have not done
explicit tests.)

Is the improved efficiency of dynamic codebooks worth the cost of state
management that comes with dynamic codebooks? Indeed thats a good question,
and one which depends entirely on your view of whats important in the
system. It is not a cut-and-dry comparison.

Sure, that is obviously what you want. Unfortunately, doing SIP-layer
compression first, followed by SIP-layer encryption, breaks the nice, clean
transport-layer model in the draft I have proposed. Fixing that depends on
how the SIP layer encryption is done.

Mike Thomas has proposed a framework for such a thing in:
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomas-sip-sec-framework-00.txt

His approach uses multiparts to convey compressed entities. An interesting
idea is to treat each multiparty as a "transport stream" in its own right. A
multipart is associated with a compression context. You compress it within
that context, and the resulting thing is then encrypted and placed into the
message. Whats interesting is that the compression context would then exist
between the sender of the message and the recipient of the specific
multipart (Mike has used a new To-field construct, X-SIP-SECURE-TO to
designate this). That means that support for compression would need to
extend to proxies beyond the outbound proxy for the mobile.

Now, all of this is an issue if you think that sip layer encryption is a
common thing. I suspect most of the times, transport layer encryption is
more common (IPSec or TLS). THose would happen after the compression has
been applied, so there is no problem.

Ok, it's been brought to my attention that since the draft agenda was
proposed:

1) The heated debate on provisional reliable responses has been effectively
concluded.
2)  We've allocated more time than is needed to the proxy-supported
discussion.
3)  The new session-timer draft may need some discussion
4) I failed to allocate time for 2543bis

If there are no strenuous objections, I would suggest changing the agenda
to:

Well, it will work fine, but the media may be routed to the enterprise nat
and back in, when it doesn't really have to be. There are ways to fix that
problem if either the UA or proxy know set of users behind the nat. So, lets
say A calls B through proxy P. A and B are in some enterprise that has a
nat. A allocates an address using the mechanisms specified. The call is
routed out of the enterprise to proxy P. P determines the called party B,
and knows (presumably through configuration) that A and B are behind the
same NAT. If it can recognize the address in the SDP as a public binding, it
can reject the request and inform the caller to retry without the binding. A
similar thing can be done if the UAS recognizes the scenario rather than the
proxy. Lots of assumptions here about detection this case.

I'll note that the problem isn't really specific to this solution. The same
problem would arise if a traditional SIP ALG were embedded in the nat. It
would also arise if a midcom nat were used, and the client or proxy
allocated bindings. It would also arise (and, in fact, be far worse) if VPN
were being used, as the media would not just go to the enterprise nat and
back, but all the way to the vpn server and back. 

An interesting solution might be for the caller (and callee) to always offer
two alternate media streams (using the FID draft), one of which is with its
public address, and another with the private address. If media starts
arriving on the private address, it re-invites to disable the stream on the
public one. Actually, that is probably the most robust and simplest
solution. Not sure FID gives you all the semantics you need for this,
though...

How is that? The whole idea is that a public address is used in the SDP.

Yes, as I comment above, it is worse for the VPN case.

Hi,

I agree, it is important that we can proceed fast, and also that the final
compression work will probably be a synthesis of the ideas in the current
contributions.
I also share the idea with Jonathan, to separate message compression into
two problems; a Protocol and the actual compression Algorithm, see 1) and 2)
below.

1) The Scheme/Protocol
- Message handling. E.g. verification of correct decompression, usage of
previous messages in the compression process, context handling
(dictionary/codebook handling)
2) The actual compression algorithm
- What to save in the dictionaries/codebooks etc..
- Compressed message representation. E.g. different Lempel-Ziw based
representations.

In our contribution, ROGER
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hannu-rohc-roger-01.txt
we are following this grouping. E.g. the actual compression algorithm can be
substituted and ROGER's focus has been more set on number 1 above.
I believe that the other contributions more or less have this separation.

Hi,

EPIC is not just a static dictionary for a Lempel-Ziv compressor: rather
it is a new compression algorithm proposed as an alternative to Lempel-Ziv.
The key difference between the algorithms is that all Lempel-Ziv variants
store the dictionary as a single text string, whereas EPIC stores the dictionary
as a set of named "fields" as defined by the BNF of the protocol.

EPIC includes the concept of a dynamic dictionary, since one of the binary
characters we can send means "field is same as previous instance of field". This
is optional though, depending on whether the bigger compression ratio is worth
the extra hassle of maintaining robustness.

We tested EPIC against several variants of Lempel-Ziv and found the compression
ratio to be around twice that even of LZSS. This seems to be independent of whether
we use a dynamic dictionary or not: without one we get a compression ratio of
2.8 vs 1.4 for LZSS, and with dynamic dictionaries we get 22.2 vs 10.6 for LZSS.

Perhaps more importantly, the memory requirements of EPIC are much lower than
Lempel-Ziv because it only keeps the fields which will reappear in the message flow
with high probability. The dynamic dictionary requirements of our implementation
are sub 100 bytes for the SIP flow tested above. Processing requirements are
lower too, just because there is less dictionary to search.

Questions and comments gratefully appreciated.

It seems like what you are really talking about is a static dictionary based
on a study of the BNF of the protocol. I suspect that you could probably
hand tune a static dictionary to be even better based on knowledge of what
actually comes in a SIP message in real scenarios. I still think a dynamic
dictionary ontop of a static one like you propose is even better, any my
initial tests gave me 8:1 compression, far better than anything reported
with pure static (and I will note that this was with an LZW variant; if you
pay the compute overhead of LZSS it will really rock, but I have not done
explicit tests.)

Is the improved efficiency of dynamic codebooks worth the cost of state
management that comes with dynamic codebooks? Indeed thats a good question,
and one which depends entirely on your view of whats important in the
system. It is not a cut-and-dry comparison.

Hi Billy

In section 2.2 of draft-biggs-sip-replaces-01, you specify that "A unique
call-id may be given to the replacement call.".  This seems unnecessarily
weak and could lead to interoperability problems where an application
assumes the re-use of the Call-ID.

If a unique Call-ID is required, as specified in RFC 2543, then why give the
end-point the option to re-use the existing Call-ID?

I suggest that "A unique call-id MUST be given to the replacement call".

Regards

Jonathan

  When we were first discussing methods of performing attended call
transfer, there was alot of discussion about using the Call-ID to
perform the replaces operation, that is, the replacement call (or
joining call) would be identified by having the same Call-ID as an
existing call.

  So, the text should really read "in our replaces model, a unique
call-id may be given to the replacement call, instead of previous models
which overloaded the meaning of the call-id".  I wasn't trying to
dictate behavior either way.

> I suggest that "A unique call-id MUST be given to the replacement
> call".

  Since this seems to be the modern consensus on the issue, I will
clarify this in the draft.

Yes, the online gaming world uses this technique and it seems to work  
well, so there's some successful history with the general idea of 
"send to both the public and private address and see what comes back
in the return packets on the same UDP port." Also, if the source 
address on the return packet is neither the public or private address
that a third party has handed you, its an indication that the sender
is behind a NAT that is not a Full Cone NAT, I think (not totally sure).

Hello,

An example of transcoder invokation using 3pcc can be found at:
http://www.hut.fi/~gonzalo/papers/draft-camarillo-3pcc-qos-00.txt

Note that this is an already expired draft though.

I fully agree with Adam that we do not have to design architectures that
send signalling thru a transcoder. Using 3pcc or H.248 (as it was also
suggested) allows to implement media-related services such as adding
music or manipulating video images in a much nicer way.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello,

A minor comment about 489 status code: In Adam's event draft it means
"Bad Event", and in Jonathan's early media draft it means "Request
Updated". Since both are just I-Ds this is not really an issue right
now, but when they advance to RFCs we will have to resolve this
conflict.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello,

I am sending this mail to SIP and MMUSIC because both groups are
interested in this issue. Sorry if somebody receives it twice.

We have already agreed that the SDP 0.0.0.0 mechanism for putting the
other party on hold does not work because it does not provide an address
for RTCP. Therefore, we need a new mechanism for putting on hold.

It seems that the best proposal is to use the direction tag (sendonly,
sendrecv, recvonly) to do this. It has been proposed to define a new
direction tag value that would mean that the media stream will not carry
media (neither-send-nor-receive). This could be encoded as a=nomedia,
for instance.

The first question is, do we all agree that this is the mechanism that
should be used? If so, is it appropriate to add this new tag value to
SDPnew (Colin?) ?


We also have to think about the current SDP 0.0.0.0 mechanism. While it
does not work for putting UAs in hold, it is useful in 3pcc scenarios,
where the controller does not have an IP address to provide to the
callee. Do we want to still use SDP 0.0.0.0 in this scenario?

Regards,

Gonzalo

The following paragraph from rfc2806 indicates 
to me that a "+", "=" and ";" would require 
escaping when used within a telephone-url.  
Am I understanding this correctly?  The SIP-URL 
allows "&", "=", "+", "$", ",", ";", "?", "/" 
for a telephone-subscriber.  Should any of these 
also be allowed unescaped in the telephone-url?


rfc2806: section 1.2 paragraph 2

Note on non-unreserved characters [RFC2396] 
in URLs: the ABNF in this document specifies 
strings of raw, unescaped characters. If 
those characters are present in a URL, and 
are not unreserved [RFC2396], they MUST be 
escaped as explained in [RFC2396] prior to 
using the URL.  In addition, when parsing a 
URL, it must be noted that some characters 
may have been escaped.

rfc2396: section 2.3

unreserved  = alphanum | mark
mark = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" 
       | "'" | "(" | ")"


If this isn't the appropriate working group
list, please let me know where I should post 
the question.

Depends on how they are used.  These characters are defined as part of the 
syntax.  When used as such, they don't need to be escaped.
Section 2.6 of RFC2806 gives several examples.

I know I will remember eventually, but can you remind me of such a
scenario? I think I recall some cases where you invite on hold, and then
reinvite. But when would this be used rather than inviting without SDP?
Where this isn't sufficient, it might be better to simply invite without
any media sessions at all, just to establish a signalling relationship.
(But I don't believe that is technically legal at the moment.)

One thing to keep in mind is that these should be mechanisms that work
with transports other than RTP and UDP. The connection oriented
transports introduce new problems. The c=0.0.0.0 for hold is one of the
things that don't work there either. The direction tag is much better.

Hello,

Actually you INVITE without SDP and get an SDP in the 200 OK. Now you
MUST send an SDP in the ACK.

You MAY try to send an INVITE with the SDP just obtained to the other
party and expect the 200 OK to arrive quickly enough. That is, before
the fist party gets tired of retransmitting the 200 OK without getting
an ACK.

Luckily you have another option. When you receive the 200 OK from your
first INVITE without SDP, you send an ACK with SDP 0.0.0.0 (hold). Then
you INVITE the other party and get his SDP. Now you can re-INVITE the
first party.

You INVITE without any media description. The thing is that since you
will get media description in the 200 OK, you MUST send an SDP in your
ACK.

Yes, the direction tag is the way to go (as I proposed in my previous
mail). I was just saying that the direction tag resolves 95% of the
scenarios, but not all of them.

Thanks for the response.

I agree in the concept of your answer.  
However rfc2806 does not specifically unreserved 
any characters for the syntax.  And it does not
mention them in section 1.2 paragraph 2 which
explicitly mentions to escape all that is
non-unreserved from rfc2396 even if unescaped
in ABNF.

Which characters have been reserved for the 
syntax or future-syntax?

Which characters within private-prefix, 
token-char, and quoted-string need to be 
escaped?

OK, that makes some sense. But it is problematic unless it can be
depended upon to work all the time, with any type of media. (The 3pcc
may not understand the media being used by the endpoints.) I am not sure
this is the case.

Also, isn't there a potential problem with this technique? 
After you re-INVITE the first party with the SDP from the other party,
the SDP you get back may not be the same as it was in the first invite.
If not, then you have to reinvite the other party again. This process
may never terminate. 

Seems like it would be better to count on turning around the invite to
the other party before the first party times out. It takes a long time
to timeout, so this shouldn't usually be a problem.

What I meant was that you might invite with the intent of establishing a
call that has no media sessions. It isn't straightforward to do, since
if you offer SDP that contains no m= lines it is like offering no SDP.
You can probably do it by offering an SDP with "m=xxx 0 ...", but
probably most UAs would reject this as useless. And in any case it
wouldn't serve your purpose.

Ok, it's been brought to my attention that since the draft agenda was
proposed:

1) The heated debate on provisional reliable responses has been
effectively
concluded.
2)  We've allocated more time than is needed to the proxy-supported
discussion.
3)  The new session-timer draft may need some discussion
4) I failed to allocate time for 2543bis

If there are no strenuous objections, I would suggest changing the
