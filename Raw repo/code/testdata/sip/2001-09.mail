You can regard the BGCF as doing much the same job as I-CSCFs do between
S-CSCFs, but between an S-CSCF and an MGCF. Whatever arguments therefore
apply to the protocol selection for I-CSCF interfaces thus also apply to the
BGCF.

The main function of these entities is to act as a router (at the SIP level)
to another SIP entity, and people keep telling me that is what SIP proxies
are good at.

I would love to get the specification tidied up in this respect.

If we take Jonathans proposal, at the moment we seem to be concentrating to
much on only allowing it on INVITE. It appears to me that we should be
working in terms of those methods that are allowed to send provisional
responses.

Perhaps we could identify the following bits that should be specified

-	all methods (in the document where they are specified) should
specify whether provisional responses are allowed for that method or not. In
the bis draft they should only be allowed for INVITE.

-	we should make the text in 11.1 of the bis draft subject to this. It
seems to be general to all methods at the moment.

-	CANCEL should only be allowed on methods where provisional responses
are allowed.

-	All methods where provisional responses are not allowed should
respond "immediately" with a final response. This should probably be added
to 11.1 where the 200 ms timer is specified.

For the bis draft, this makes it the same as Jonathans proposal, but leaves
later method designers the ability to allow it or not, based on whether they
allow provisional responses or not, and keeps the bis draft as generic as
possible.

No doubt I have missed some important issues on this, but the important
thing to me is to keep as much of this as possible as generic to all
methods, including those that may be defined in the future. I want to avoid
defining exceptions to the bis draft for every method to be defined in the
future, which was the state we were in with the current text on CANCEL. 

Note that, if we have to use the SHOULD NOT for sending that Jonathan seems
to be proposing to allow compatibility with existing implementations, then
it should be allowed only for those methods that are currently at RFC
status. I would prefer to have it specified as MUST NOT.

In the wireline world, we call that a "Softswitch" --  it does SIP on one
side, some kind of signaling out the other (like SS7) and some sort of media
gateway control protocol to establish media paths supporting the
RTP-to-whatever bearer channel.

Such a device might learn about addressing on the SIP network via TRIP, or
might use entirely different routing table management methods, but it's
certainly going to need SIP for the actual session signaling.

(Due to travel, I probably missed some of the discussion, so excuse me
for re-raising old issues.)

A few notes:

- I think the complexity of CANCEL for non-INVITE on the server side is
essentially zero. If you don't implement it, you can either return 481
(i.e., the request has already been completed) or 405 (but see below).

- If we don't allow CANCEL for non-INVITE, we have to extend the
definition of 405 (or define a new status code), since the method *is*
supported for an INVITE for the same URL. To wit, the current text says:

"The method specified in the \header{Request-Line} is not allowed for
the
address identified by the \header{Request-URI}.  The response {\MUST}
include an \header{Allow} header field containing a list of valid
methods for the indicated address."

Note that this defines the granularity of requests at the URI level, not
at the method level.

- Does anything else get simpler if we disallow CANCEL for non-INVITE?

- Under the current model, non-INVITE transactions can have non-zero
duration, if you return a 1xx response. Thus, it is at least conceivable
that there are methods where the CANCEL could actually accomplish
something.

We call it a Softswitch in the wireless world as well since Softswitches 
are media independent. But your description is accurate. I might also add 
that SIP isn't just for session signalling, but it also may be used by the 
Softswitch to talk to the application layer. The ISC (www.softswitch.org) 
has a nice Application Framework document that describes this.

Hi,

First, one could argue that this is pretty much a network architecture
question. The outbound proxy in the network is there for a reason, and
if the functionality it provides requires it to record-route it shall do
so, or the network simply won't work.

The problem with 1) could be that it if the outbound proxy is stateful,
and it may receive a BYE for a call that doesn't exist (the INVITE was
sent in the other direction, using another route). In the firewall
example that would probably not be the case, because the requests in
both directions most probably go through that same proxy. But, if the
outbound proxy is only used as a "phone book" (the UAC doesn't do DNS,
for example) incoming requests do not need to go via that same proxy.

If 2) is used, I am not sure we need to write so much about the outbound
proxy as a separate node in the first place. The request routing chapter
may simply say that the user may configure a proxy (call it outbound
proxy if you want...) which is used as the "last resort" to send
requests there.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

From the discussions so far, I believe that the following changes
could usefully be made to the current UDPComp draft:

Dictionary structure:

Should be able to handle a wide range of compression algorithms
(in particular SIP-aware algorithms like EPIC, TCCB and
template-based compression, as the current overhead for these
schemes is large). The protocol overhead should be minimal, as
should the complexity of the dictionary structure.

My current favourite is the digraph dictionary, which is simpler
than a tree structure and more general to boot. I could provide
some text on this if it is needed.

Context management:

Currently the context is identified by IP address and port, and is
initialised empty. However this does not at present allow us to use
the following:

  -  User-specific dictionary
  -  Cross session dictionary
  -  Shared dictionary

Perhaps we could make the context selection a local implementation
decision at the compressor (as per RFC 3095)? This would generalise
what we can keep in the dictionary across sessions without needing
additional standardisation.

Any volunteers to have a closer look at context management?

Robustness:

We need to check that any new mechanism is robust against
misordering and dropped packets.

If possible, it would be nice to release a working group draft for
signalling compression over the next few weeks. Do we need the
updated charter in order to do this?

I have included some comments and a few additional points inline.

Having a user-specific dictionary gives a big boost to the
compression ratio (80% better for EPIC, 40% better for
TCCB etc.), so we should clearly think about how to capture
this performance benefit. How does it square with the
UDPComp idea of making the compression algorithm a local
implementation decision? How would we go about standardising
a user-specific dictionary within this framework?

This is another clear win in terms of performance, especially
if we aren't using preconfigured static dictionaries. I
believe that the "context" is currently defined by a pair of
IP addresses and ports. Instead, perhaps we could just make
context selection a local implementation decision at the
compressor?

The main difficulty here is ensuring that the dictionary
can continue to be used while entries are in the process of
being added or modified. Any dictionary structure we use
must be able to handle this.

Template encoding is a compression algorithm, so the dictionary
structure should be chosen such that template-based encoding is
supported.

We might need to introduce pre-downloaded static dictionaries (very
useful for reducing the working memory requirements, as well as
for unidirectional links where it is more difficult to dynamically
modify the dictionary).

RE: [Sipping] SIP Negotiate
I agree that there is a need for this kind of functionality. However,
when you say in the beginning "Examples of parameters that
... include ... message integrity mechanisms, encryption
algorithms, etc.", I'd like to note that this what we need in
terms of security parameters is a _secure_ negotiation of them.
As you say yourself in section 10.1 of
http://www.obsidian97.com/draft-spbs-sip-negotiate-00.txt :

> One of the intended uses for the negotiation mechanism is to set
> up authentication and message integrity algorithms. Thus the 
> NEGOTIATE method itself is not subject to these protections - this
> makes the recipient vulnerable to the Man-in-the-middle attacks. 
> Views are solicited to mitigate this security consideration.

This is a crucial point to handle correctly. Otherwise the peers
may be fooled onto using insecure algorithms or perhaps even
no algorithms at all. It is also interesting to note that the answer
can't really be "integrity protect the NEGOTIATE" because
that would mean an integrity protection algorithm would have
to be applied before one is selected!

We've done some work on this issue earlier in the context of
SIP usage in 3G networks, and came up with some requirements.
These included the following:

* MUST be able to choose different integrity algorithms,
  MAY be able to choose other security parameters,
  encryption algorithms, and security protocols.
* It MUST be possible to protect the parameter negotiation
  against attackers who do not have the secret authentication
  keys (and can't forge hashes in real-time).
* MUST not add new roundtrips (i.e. done in parallel with
  other setup such as registration or authentication). In particular,
  it would not be nice if we had separate negotiation phases for security,
  compression, sip itself, and only then we'd be able to do
  something.

Traditionally, security protocols have solved secure negotiation
of parameters by hashing/signing the offers with authentication
keys or keys derived from authentication. For instance, IKE
negotiates parameters in cleartext but in a later phase a keyed
hash is taken from the original parameter offers and responses,
and sent to the other side as a proof that nothing was changed in
the packet's path.

Something similar needs to happen here as well. We've had
the idea that once integrity protection can be turned on, you'll
repeat the offers under it, and only after this you can start to
trust and use what was negotiated. (Integrity protection can be
turned on basically after something has given you keys
and you have agreed on the selected algorithm.)

Hi All,

I have a query regarding "qop" and "cnonce" fields in Digest =
Authentication procedure. Looks like some gap in the specs. Please =
provide your input.

The problem is that if qop parameter does not arrive in the Challenge
(401/407) and the algo for the session is "MD5-sess" then Hash Key A1 is =
built with "cnonce-value" at the client, but "cnonce-value" is not sent =
to the Server in the subsquent Requests.

Then How will the Server decode the response without the "cnonce-value"?

Does it mean that if Algo is "MD5-Sess", then qop parameter MUST be =
supplied to the client in the Challenge?

Quoted from RFC 2617, Sec 3.2.2:

"If qop (Quality of Protection) is not sent to the Client then cnonce
value and nonce-count value MUST NOT  be specified in the subsquents
requests."

AND (construction of the Hash Key A1)

If Algo is "MD5-sess" then A1 is calculated as
A1 =3DH(unq(username-value) ":" unq(realm-value) ":" passwd ":"
unq(nonce-value) ":"   unq(cnonce-value)

where A1 is the Session Key for authentication of subsquent requests and
responses.

A1 is used to calculate the response-digest along with the second hash
Key A2.

Hi,

Comments inline.

>
> Any volunteers to have a closer look at context management?

I'll take a look at this. I believe that there are text in both ROGER and
SCRIBE that can be reused for this.

By the way, as context management has a little bit to do with
acknowledgement of messages. Do you believe that we need an explicit
acknowledgement scheme as describe in ROGER and SCRIBE? - I do so, in order
to maintain generality of the scheme.

> Robustness:
>
> We need to check that any new mechanism is robust against
> misordering and dropped packets.

Yes. Also if the scheme encounters a hop in the sequence numbers, it should
not stop updating the "dynamic dictionary" in order to use more information
in the compression/decompression process.

If both compressor and decompressor have this kind of information, I do not
see a problem with this, but maybe I'm missing something.

>How would we go about standardising
> a user-specific dictionary within this framework?

As long as we use the corresponding context at the decompressor. Do you see
another way on how to identify the context?

Yes, this is something I believe we should have.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Extensions for supporting Distributed Call State
	Author(s)	: W. Marshall et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-state-02.txt
	Pages		: 12
	Date		: 31-Aug-01
	
This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) that enables proxies to distribute call state to user
agents. The state information can be returned to the proxy when the
user agent requests a change in the characteristics of the active
call. By providing the ability to distribute state to the user
agents where it can be securely stored, proxy servers can remain
stateless for the duration of the call. This mechanism allows a
proxy server to provide services that depend on call state, while
still being stateless.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Integration of Resource Management and SIP
	Author(s)	: W. Marshall et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks-resource-02.txt
	Pages		: 28
	Date		: 31-Aug-01
	
This document discusses how network QoS and security establishment
can be made a precondition to sessions initiated by the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP), and described by SDP. These preconditions
require that the participant reserve network resources (or establish
a secure media channel) before continuing with the session. We do
not define new QoS reservation or security mechanisms; these pre-
conditions simply require a participant to use existing resource
reservation and security mechanisms before beginning the session.
This results in a multi-phase call-setup mechanism, with the
resource management protocol interleaved between two phases of call
signaling. The objective of such a mechanism is to enable deployment
of robust IP Telephony services, by ensuring that resources are made
available before the phone rings and the participants of the call
are 'invited' to participate.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: The SIP Negotiate Method
	Author(s)	: S. Parameswar, B. Stucker
	Filename	: draft-spbs-sip-negotiate-00.txt
	Pages		: 
	Date		: 31-Aug-01
	
There is a need to negotiate a multitude of parameters, settings, 
and algorithms when setting up sessions using Session Initiated 
Protocol (SIP). While SIP itself provides mechanisms for 
negotiation of these parameters on a per-session basis through the
use of the INVITE method, it does not provide a ready mechanism
for meta-session negotiation. The closest mechanism provided is 
the REGISTER method, however, this method is directed towards the 
registrar alone, and cannot be used to conduct negotiation of 
parameters between any two arbitrary SIP nodes.

Hello.

In Section 5, is it very useful (helpful, even) to allow
Caller Prefs in a CANCEL request?  Seems it would only be
relevant in a case where a server saw a CANCEL and couldn't
match it to any existing Transaction, and that's about as
unlikely as an extremely unlikely thing in Unlikelyland.

In Section 5.5, under "queue-feature", I am not sure that
the text should say that "A pending call be terminated by
a SIP CANCEL or BYE request"; surely it should just be a
CANCEL?

Uber-Nit: Section 6.1: "They SHOULD reflect actual
characteristics of the URLs being registered."
                       ^^^^
should read "URIs"?

In Section 6.3, it doesn't seem too helpful to even give
the posibility of using Proxy-Require?  As is noted, it
is likely to cause the request to fail, and even if the
request doesn't fail, these are only preferences....

Nit: Section 6.4.2: In the paragraph beginning "If the
server proxies", I think it would be slightly clearer if
the text read "If the server elects to do a parallel
proxy", rather than "If the server elects to do a forking
proxy".

Finally, Section 9, I would have thought it would be
better to lean toward the positive case with the "too
many rules"; i.e., make the reject a MAY.  But maybe I'm
just too trusting/naiieve. &:)

In the wireline world, we call that a "Softswitch" --  it does SIP on one
side, some kind of signaling out the other (like SS7) and some sort of media
gateway control protocol to establish media paths supporting the
RTP-to-whatever bearer channel.

Such a device might learn about addressing on the SIP network via TRIP, or
might use entirely different routing table management methods, but it's
certainly going to need SIP for the actual session signaling.

	There is an error in section 12.1 in the latest session timer draft
- draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-06.txt.

	In the 'Basic session timer' example, the description says that a
session timer is of two minutes. However the value in the Session-Expires in
the ACK is 3600 (== 60 minutes). Also the refresh is sent after 60 seconds
but the timeout is detected after 3550 seconds.

Regards,

Chinmay

I don't believe the following paragraph in the ACK method description
(Section 5.1.1) is correct:

   A proxy server receiving an ACK request after having sent a 3xx, 4xx,
   5xx, or 6xx response must make a determination about whether the ACK
   is for it, or for some user agent or proxy server further downstream.
   This determination is made by examining the tag in the To field. If
   the tag in the ACK To header field matches the tag in the To header
   field of the response, and the From, CSeq and Call-ID header fields
   in the response match those in the ACK, the ACK is meant for the
   proxy server. Otherwise, the ACK SHOULD be proxied downstream as any
   other request. However, an ACK not destined for the proxy SHOULD NOT
   be retransmitted.

ACK's for non-2xx responses are hop-by-hop and the UAC does not copy the
tags from the non-2xx response into the ACK message, as described in Section
15.4:

   A UAC copies the tag from the final response into the ACK, but
   it MUST NOT copy the tag into any subsequent requests unless the
   response was a 200-class response to an INVITE request.

Robert.

You are misreading the paragraph.

The tag is copied into the ACK for 2xx, 
3xx, 4xx, 5xx, and 6xx responses.  It 
isn't copied into subsequent requests 
unless the response was a 200-class 
response to an INVITE request.

Consider this scenario:

Say A, and B are in an audio call. If A wants to invite C into their
session and establish a conference call, A could use REFER to set up the
call, correct? If C can establish whatever session with A and B, C could
possibly choose to establish an IM session with the other two parties. 

Also consider this:

Say A and B are in an audio call. A is a sip phone that is incapable of
doing IM. Say B wants to transfer the call to C, C may establish an IM
session with A (which may fail). A and C would not be able to have a
meaningful session. 

For both cases, it is perfectly legitimate to for C to try to establish
an IM session. However, it is clearly not very meaningful or useful.

If A has the option to specify the type of session it wants C to
establish with the refer-to party, C could establish a meaningful
session. If C does not want to set up a session of the specified type,
it could still decline the REFER. 

An option to specify the media type in refer seems very attractive.

The REFER doesn't indicate it.  B decides 
what sort of session it wishes to establish 
with C.  

A similar decision is made for 
INVITE without SDP situations.

Hi,

Based on the response routing procedures specified in Section 10.46.5, page
60 of bis-04, the UAS should use the "maddr" value, if present in Via
header, to send a SIP response over UDP. If the "maddr" is not present, the
UAS should then use the source IP address.

The draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt doesn't mention the "maddr" address. If the
client inserts a "rport" parameter in Via header as well as a "maddr"
parameter, should the server ignore the maddr parameter and always send the
response to the source IP address and port?

Thanks,
YoungSun

Yeah, I agree here. This seems like a proxy. Its similar to the SIP/TRIP
model, where a proxy fronts a farm of gateways. TRIP is used to push
resource availability information to the proxy, so that when a SIP call
arrives, it can make an intelligent routing decision based on the tables
that TRIP has populated. Here, its a media server and not a gateway. The
types of information propagated will therefore be different. But,
architecturally, it seems similar.

Right. maddr in the via is for multicast.

Good question. Assuming multicast actually works through nat (highly
unlikely), you would want the response to be sent via multicast, and
therefore it should use the maddr address and the port in sent-by. The
source port is not what you want at all for multicast.

I'll add wording to describe that.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: ISUP to SIP Mapping
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Roach, J. Peterson, L. Ong
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-isup-03.txt
	Pages		: 55
	Date		: 04-Sep-01
	
This document describes a way to perform the mapping between two
signaling protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
ISDN User Part (ISUP) of SS7. This mechanism might be implemented
when using SIP in an environment where part of the call involves
interworking with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-03.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-isup-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I think this is valid.  (Well, I think it might technically
only be unique within the sent-by space, but that's a small
issue.)   There might be a slight issue with 2543 proxies,
but I'm thinking that they would fail to notice the merge
anyway...?

Uh.  I don't think it should apply the same response to all.
What is the motivation for this?  I think this would mean
that we would get the horrible forked route problem.  I would
suggest that the UA has the oppurtunity to prefer one request
over all the others (in the case of a 200) (this decision
may be arbitrarily complex), and 482 the rest.

> Comments? My leaning is probably 3 since I think its the easiest.

Agreed.  I would see 2 as very hard in general.

Looks fine to me.  The "MUST NOT" applies to re-INVITEs,
etc. (which don't exist unless there was a 2xx).

I believe you're right -- I think I was thinking of the MGCF.

But it still uses SIP, not TRIP, for dealing with an individual session.

Correct.

C should pass an INVITE with SDP describing 
all media connections it is willing to 
participate.  If C is only willing to 
participate in an IM, it only passes the
IM media description in the SDP.

It would fail if C only wishes to allow an IM 
session and A is only capable of performing 
a voice session.  The protocol allows the 
failure to be detected.  The call between A 
and B can remain.

Alternatively C can send OPTIONS to
determine what type of sessions A can support 
prior to sending the first INVITE to deal with 
"I prefer IM, but I'll do voice if required"
functionality.

This option isn't needed unless the REFERer 
isn't willing to allow the REFERed and 
Refer-to parties negotiate the type of 
session.

This option would be nice from a 
billing perspective if the transferring 
party is going to be billed for the call 
between transferee and transfer-to.  
However this is a separate issue.

From a 3PCC perspective, I'd love to have 
this sort of control/communication.  
However I think that there were some people 
opposed to passing SDP/headers/parameters
within the REFER to communicate this sort 
of thing.

I've noted some inconsistencies in the treatment of the User-Agent and
Server headers.  

First off, User-Agent is shown as a general header in Tables 5 and 6 of
2543bis but should, according to its description, appear only in requests.  

Secondly, there is a security warning regarding the Server header in RFC
2616.  In SIP this warning would be equally applicable to the User-Agent
header.  We may find it necessary to reproduce that warning in 2543bis.

Finally, given that the User-Agent header is present in Table 6, it seems
odd that the Server header is not there too.

Subject: [Sip] Questions about the SIP Replaces Header draft.
Sender: sip-admin@ietf.org
Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org
X-Mailman-Version: 1.0
Precedence: bulk
List-Id: Session Initiation Protocol <sip.ietf.org>
X-BeenThere: sip@ietf.org

Hello,

	I have a few questions and comments regarding the SIP Replaces
Header draft -
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-biggs-sip-replaces-01.txt.

1)	In section 3 the draft states -
	"The to-tag and from-tag parameters MUST be included in the Replaces
header, as they are required for unique call-leg matching."

	In section 4 the draft states -
	"If the Replaces header matches more than one call-leg, the user
agent MAY use the Referred-By header if present to attempt to match the call
with an appropriate call-leg, but should otherwise ignore the header."

	The REFER draft says that the Referred-By header is mandatory
(section 3.2 of REFER 01 draft). Hence the words "if present" in the above
statement must be removed. 

	I also have a question regarding this -
	
	a)	When will a Replaces header match more than one call-leg.
The statements in the section 3 and 4 seem to contradict each other.

2)	In section 4 of the draft it says - 
	
	"If the Replaces header matches an unestablished call leg, that it,
the INVITE request for the call has not received or been sent a final
response, the Replaces header MUST be ignored."

	The "it" is a typo and should be "is".

	My question is - 
	How will a Replaces header match an unestablished call leg when a
response has not been received for an INVITE?

3)	I think the figures shown with the examples do not conform to the
latest REFER draft. None of the figures show NOTIFY being used. 

4)	The reference to the cc draft - reference [4], is to the old draft.

Regards,

Chinmay

Folks,

Here is another open issue I would like quick resolution on.

I am proposing to remove Appendix A completely from bis. The reason is that
the required/optional capabilities of the protocol are already specified
throughout the document through the usage of MUST/MAY/SHOULD and so on.
Having additional requirements here will only repeat what is already above,
possibly just summarizing it. This introduces the possibility of
inconsistent strengths, which is a problem right now. So, to make things
consistent and avoid confusion, we should ditch it.

Anyone object?

-Jonathan R.

Hi Folks,

Traditionally proxies that implement pre-call features (e.g. some type of 
complex forking logic) assume that they do not have to Record-Route.
Under the early-media draft, putting early media on hold using the reINVITE 
mechanism proposed can interfere with pre-call features on proxies that 
don't record route.

Below is a call flow where this problem occurs:

UA1	Proxy	UA2

INVITE ->		# original INVITE
	INVITE ->	#   first branch of this INVITE
	<- 18x		# 18x with offer for early media
<- 18x
PRACK -------->	# answer accepting early media
<--- 200 (PRACK)
<==============	# early media flows

so far, so good--we now have early media flowing from UA2 to UA1
...

Now UA1 wants to put this media on hold using a reINVITE

INVITE ------->	# UA1 wants to put early media on hold
	<- 490		# UA2 terminates the previous INVITE transaction
<---------- 18x
  	
At this point the proxy believes that the first branch has been 
terminated.  The proxy now has no control over the INVITE which replaced 
the earlier transaction.  The proxy can never cancel this first branch.

Fortunately this is easy to solve.  I propose using a separate method to 
convey that the caller wants to modify early media.  I will use the OFFER 
method (listed as option 4 in the early media draft) as an example.

OFFER ----------->	# this SDP offers to put early media on hold
<------------ 200	# this SDP answers the offer

The 18x/PRACK for early media offered by the callee, and accepted/rejected 
by the the caller still works fine.

thanks,
-rohan

Rohan,

I agree with you that the early media re-INVITE call flows should be changed
(too complicated for starters).

I suggested a while back that the "OFFER" request/response does not carry
SDP itself. I believe this avoid a number of nasty synchronization problems
with INVITE responses. Instead the "OFFER" method simply prompts the UAS to
regenerate its last 183 response (ie, the offer message is asking the UAS to
generate OFFER rather than carrying the UAC's offer). This allows the UAC to
put media on hold or whatever it wants. This requires no extra SDP/media
processing logic on either side - the same mechanism is reused which is a
big bonus in my books. 

Cheers,

Robert.

Hi,

Before the Last Call period is complete on caller preferences, I wanted to 
verify that we can extend caller prefs if needed. ??  I just posted a 
proposal for three new Contact attributes which I feel are needed for call 
control, and could be useful in Accept/Reject-Contact.

Please post any comments on my call-control attributes proposal to the 
sipping list.

thanks,
-rohan

The contact parameters can indeed be extended. The proxy algorithm is
independent of the semantics, and so proxies need not be aware of new
attributes. The UAC that requests a preference, and the UAS that indicates a
capability, have to sync up and use the same name/value pairs.

Request disposition cannot be extended, on purpose.

This is a first cut of a last call review of
draft-ietf-sip-manyfolk-resource-02.txt

NITS (Doing LC so I didn't really check)
====

The table numbering is messed up there are two tables 3 and 4.
Table 4 Summary of header fields, P-Z, not in alphabetical order ;-)
Section 16 is vague to the point of uselessness as no IPR statements on the
IETF page refer directly to this draft.

LC Review
=========

Generally, I believe this draft uses functionality only working in the bis
drafts, large portions repeat the base spec (sometimes inaccurately),
however, nothing is a major problem and with these corrections I'd be happy
with the draft.

Section 3
=========

"QoS Assured" vs "QoS Enabled"
------------------------------

QoS Assured, how can this be backwardly compatible, if the UAC goes straight
to ringing this will fail. I am not sure if this draft can guarantee QoS
Assured sessions and backwards compatibility. (Unless Requires header is
used, but this isn't explicitly stated, and then the call will fail)

Section 5.1
===========

Really a NIT, but I'd remove the i,u and e values for clarity of the example
SDP

Section 6
=========

Record-Route issues
-------------------

Firstly Record-Route is broken in rfc2543, so I'll base comments on the bis
version.

"If the initial request contained Record-Route headers, the provisional
response MUST contain a copy of these headers...", The MUST conflicts with
the SHOULD in section 16.2 of bis04 and some of the text later on in the
section.

Retransmission Strategy
-----------------------

This differs (unintentionally ?) from the retransmission strategy of
non-INVITEs. Why not just reference standard retransmission? (Requests are
retransmitted every T2 seconds after a provisional response has been
received, until 11 messages have been sent or a final response is received.)

Section 6.1
===========

Content-Length should be "m*"
Hide is depreciated

The following are missing

Authentication-Info
Alert-Info
Call-Info
Content-Disposition
Content-Language
In-Reply-To
MIME-version
Supported

Sections 7 & 8
==============

The section numbers are wrong for the bis. The whole section would be
better, not trying to be errata to the SIP spec.

Section 9
=========

Content-Disposition is in the bis.

HTH

James Undery

Hi,

A comment on the manyfolk draft.

Chapter 6 says:

"The Route header that is constructed from some provisional response
MUST NOT be placed in any other request except for the COMET for that
provisional response".

I guess that is wrong, since we now have other pre-call requests, ie
INFO and BYE.

This comment was given before, but I don't think there was any
decission, and the text it refers to is still in the draft.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The Refer Method
	Author(s)	: R. Sparks
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-refer-01.txt
	Pages		: 14
	Date		: 05-Sep-01
	
This document defines the REFER method.  This SIP extension requests
that the recipient REFER to a resource provided in the request.  This
can be used to enable many applications, including Call Transfer.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-01.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-refer-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I'd agree with Christer on this, and note that this problem stems from not
referencing the base spec for standard behaviour.

I'm OK with removing Appendix A. Are you still planning to make it a
separate draft?

Hello,

I have a question for the people on this list:

Why does SIP continue to get so complex in order to provide the same basic 
telephony services that other telephony protocols developed long ago?

I'm studying the SIP protocol in school and ran across this list, so I 
figured I'd ask. It doesn't seem obvious to me what the real answer is.

P

P,

Trying to provide telephony services is, by its very nature, somewhat
complex.  As the issues being solved get more complicated, so will the
protocol.

Of course, the goal of SIP is to keep the complexity to a minimum.
Unfortunately, you will certainly see the protocol get more complex.
However, I think the engineers working on SIP are conscientious of this fact
and are striving to strike a good balance between complexity and
functionality.  Some functionality that is not core to SIP or essential in
all signaling scenarios is being defined in separate documents for those
more vertical applications.  I think that's the right approach.

Paul

Based on feedback from Dean, I'm going to change the
encoding considerations section in this draft to the following:

SIP specifies UTF-8 encoding. While most header names and data
elements will lie in the 7-bit ascii compatible range, data
elements and SIP bodies may contain 8-bit values. In order to
preserve the "readability" of SIP messages being carried as the
body of other messages, message/sip parts (including any body parts 
the message/sip message contains) SHOULD be UTF-8 encoded. If 
transcoding a contained body part is not feasible, the message/sip
part MAY be binary encoded. If the transport is not 8-bit clean,
encoding formats such as base-64 can be used.

Any other comments?

Subject: [Sip] Questions about the SIP Replaces Header draft.


Hello,

	I have a few questions and comments regarding the SIP Replaces
Header draft -
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-biggs-sip-replaces-01.txt.

1)	In section 3 the draft states -
	"The to-tag and from-tag parameters MUST be included in the Replaces
header, as they are required for unique call-leg matching."

	In section 4 the draft states -
	"If the Replaces header matches more than one call-leg, the user
agent MAY use the Referred-By header if present to attempt to match the call
with an appropriate call-leg, but should otherwise ignore the header."

	The REFER draft says that the Referred-By header is mandatory
(section 3.2 of REFER 01 draft). Hence the words "if present" in the above
statement must be removed. 

[Sriram] The Refer draft says its mandatory in a REFER. The Replaces draft
         is talking about INVITEs. The Replaces header is sent only in an
         INVITE. The Refer draft goes on the say that the Referred-by may
         be carried in other SIP Requests like INVITEs so no changes are
         required.

	I also have a question regarding this -
	
	a)	When will a Replaces header match more than one call-leg.
The statements in the section 3 and 4 seem to contradict each other.

2)	In section 4 of the draft it says - 
	
	"If the Replaces header matches an unestablished call leg, that it,
the INVITE request for the call has not received or been sent a final
response, the Replaces header MUST be ignored."

	The "it" is a typo and should be "is".

	My question is - 
	How will a Replaces header match an unestablished call leg when a
response has not been received for an INVITE?



3)	I think the figures shown with the examples do not conform to the
latest REFER draft. None of the figures show NOTIFY being used. 

[Sriram]  Correct! A new version needs to be done. Also need the 202 for 
          the Refer.

4)	The reference to the cc draft - reference [4], is to the old draft.

Regards,

Chinmay

Potentially the "media=" aspects of
draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs could be used 
to communicate such information within the 
REFER to reduce the media negotiation 
between the referred and refer-to.

Can the SIP user agent cancel the unestablished call leg instead of ignoring the
Replaces header?
What is the reason behind to ignore Replaces header for an unestablished
matching call leg?

If you study the protocol, SIP is not really intended to
provide the same basic telephone services.  The underlying
design philosophies appear to be more aimed at facilitating
the development of new services rather than anything else.

The complexity arises not from trying to implement *just*
the basic telephone services, the complexity arises from
trying to develop a system that is flexible enough to handle
*any* service, or close to it, even between SIP entities
that might not understand/implement a specific service/method.
(Thus all the debate about whether methods other than INVITE
should fork/support CANCEL, etc.  If the goal was only basic
telephone service, there would be no other hypothetical
methods, and it would not be an issue -- the complexity
arises from trying to maintain flexibility.)

It's a protocol designed by programmers for programmers
as a protocol that makes it easy for people to write 
applications and services for due to its similarities to
other well-known protocols like HTTP, etc.  The assumption 
is that the hypothetical services-that-will-be-developed
are going to be beneficial enough to justify the complexity/
inefficiency of the protocol and that by creating an
environment favorable to development will speed development
of self-same future services.

The development of new services in turn would spur
the adoption of the protocol/new end points among the user
base.  If efficiency/simplicity was the primary goal, there
would not be people talking about taking a four byte integer,
converting it to a text string, compressing it with a dynamic
dictionary compression algorithm, squirting it over a wireless
link, uncompressing it back to a text string, and converting
it back to a four byte integer. :-)

So, the complexity is not just basic telephone services --
the complexity is from trying to support the PSTN model,
the H.323 model (with the delayed media issue), forking,
etc. etc. while placing as few constraints as possible on
any future service and to support all of them at the exact
same time. (i.e. a H.323 end point getting converted to
SIP via a gateway, hitting a forking proxy, terminating
on a SIP<->PSTN gateway, etc.  Trying to get that to work
transparently is not simple without restraints.)

I think the main cause is that we have moved complexity from the core of the
network out to its edge--from centralized complexity, e.g., in switches, to
distributed complexity, e.g., in UAs--thus increasing the size/complexity of
the channels between all entities and probably the overall complexity of the
system, even without the added complexity due to new capabilities. Here's
another way to think about it, protocol-wise. If the PSTN is ordering a
combo meal at McDonalds, XoIP is cooking at home. Freedom has a price.

Allow header is sufficient.

Section 3.3 should potentially be updated 
so that Allow and Accept can be passed 
within the REFER.  This would enable the 
referrer to communicate to the referred 
about the support/non-support of the 
NOTIFY and/or "message/sipfrag".

Why not ISUP.  Like all good things ISUPs time is limited, ISUP was designed
to move voice calls efficiently in a closed network. If SIP is half as
successful as ISUP it will be very impressive.  The reality is this.  SIP
supports an economically disruptive network model that allows a service
provider to provide not only the features supported by ISUP but does it with
less network, more cost effective hard ware platforms and through cheaper
and fast access methods.  SIP is an enabling protocol that will allow
consumers to take advantages of product offerings from ASPs while having
service from whom ever.

SIP is not a prefect protocol but it is very flexible.  The thing that
allows SIP to be as successful has it has been in such a short time is its
ability to adapt quickly to needs of either ASP or Service Providers to meet
new customer demands.  

ISUP is a traditionally ridge protocol that has limit capacity to adapt to
changes.  Each time a new feature is added it takes 18 months of debate, 18
months of development, and then you get Calling Name Delivered.  If it does
not work in SIP send an email and next month you have an RFC.  If people
like it they develop to it, if not next month you have a new RFC.  This
ability to move quickly allows products to be designed, coded, tested and
deployed in the time it use to take us to determine which spare bit in a
ASN1 model that could be used to perform the required operation.     

Thx,
Nate Nelson

Hello,

I have a question for the people on this list:

Why does SIP continue to get so complex in order to provide the same basic 
telephony services that other telephony protocols developed long ago?

I'm studying the SIP protocol in school and ran across this list, so I 
figured I'd ask. It doesn't seem obvious to me what the real answer is.

I don't know whether to laugh or cry. If it were that easy to create an RFC 
we would have chaos. In reality, as SIP is further deployed, making changes 
to the core protocol will likely be much more difficult than updating ISUP.

I think that yes, the qop parameter must be supplied to the client in the
Challenge if Algo is "MD5-Sess". Anyway, quoting RFC2617, section 3.2.1:

"This directive is optional, but is made so only for backward compatibility
with RFC 2069 [6]; it SHOULD be used by all implementations compliant with
this version of the Digest scheme."

and section 3.2.2:

"This directive [the qop directive] is optional in order to preserve
backward compatibility with a minimal implementation of RFC 2069 [6], but
SHOULD be used if the server indicated that qop is supported by providing a
qop directive in the WWW-Authenticate header field."

And since RFC 2069 doesn't mention "MD5-sess", you SHOULD never end up with
a challenge without qop but with "MD5-sess" as an Algo. And if you do, I
think you can just ignore it as it is just plain wrong.

Hope that helps.

Hi All,

I have a query regarding "qop" and "cnonce" fields in Digest Authentication
procedure. Looks like some gap in the specs. Please provide your input.

The problem is that if qop parameter does not arrive in the Challenge
(401/407) and the algo for the session is "MD5-sess" then Hash Key A1 is
built with "cnonce-value" at the client, but "cnonce-value" is not sent to
the Server in the subsquent Requests.

Then How will the Server decode the response without the "cnonce-value"?

Does it mean that if Algo is "MD5-Sess", then qop parameter MUST be supplied
to the client in the Challenge?

Quoted from RFC 2617, Sec 3.2.2:

"If qop (Quality of Protection) is not sent to the Client then cnonce
value and nonce-count value MUST NOT  be specified in the subsquents
requests."

AND (construction of the Hash Key A1)

If Algo is "MD5-sess" then A1 is calculated as
A1 =H(unq(username-value) ":" unq(realm-value) ":" passwd ":"
unq(nonce-value) ":"   unq(cnonce-value)

where A1 is the Session Key for authentication of subsquent requests and
responses.

A1 is used to calculate the response-digest along with the second hash
Key A2.

Caller Preferences is supposedly in working-group-last-call, if I'm not
mistaken.

I haven't heard much discussion on the topic.

Does that mean that everybody thinks it's good to go?

Does it mean you forgot?

Or does it mean you just don't care and we should give it up? That would
sure take a load off of the IESG and the RFC editor and the Last Call
Coordinator . . . (Rakesh Rocks!)

The draft is posted at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-04.txt

should you wish to refresh your cache.

Well, REFER is part of it. You would refer everyone to a conference server.
So, specifically, A would invite the conference server itself, and then
refer B and refer C to the same URI on the conference server.

We have not specified fully distributed conferencing models, which is waht
you seem to be talking about. In the centralized variants (which includes
everything but large scale multicast in the conferencing models draft), the
conference server (which is the end system in the end system mixing case)
would be able to coordinate what media types are used as part of its
policies. One could very well have a conference server that is audio only.
If C is referred to it, and does not provide any audio streams, the server
rejects it. The NOTIFY triggered by the REFER would then tell A that the
conference cannot be established, and indeed, the included message would
tell A why.

If the referred INVITE from C to A fails becaue A has no support for IM,
then no signaling in the world will help you. The REFER mecahnisms will
allow B to know why the transfer has failed, and thats the best you can do.
If the referred INVITE from C to A fails because C indicated an IM stream
only (but it supports audio), it can still work. The rejection from A would
include an SDP listing the media types it supports. Thus, C can learn that
only audio can be established, so it can retry with audio only.

I really don't see the value in that. The SIP mechanisms will make sure that
communications are established with whatever modalities are common. Why is
that not what you want?

Good catch. Table 5/6 are in general need of a consistency check with the

Another good point.

I am sure many others are missing from there too. If the section is ditched
from bis (and so far no one objected, with one expression of support) it
doesn't matter.

Why refer B and C to the conference server rather than the reverse?  I'm
looking at an ad hoc conferencing flow right now where A and B are already
talking and they're switching to a three-way conference.  By having the
conference server call C you can get it to play ringing tone out to A and B
until the C-call-leg gets set up.

Good catch. I've fixed that and this will be reflected in -07.

Well, I have three concrete yes's to my proposal to mandate BYE (not
including my own). A few people were unsure or thought the consensus was
otherwise. Please post your opinion if you disagree. If there aren't
sufficient dissenters in ONE WEEK from today, I will declare this issue
closed.

Ah, good point. For this to work well under packet loss, changes to the
codebooks need to be incremental, so that existing stuff is unchanged by the
addition or removal of an element. My proposal violates that rule, so we
should not go that route.

I suppose we should then stick with the model where the code for the new
element is transmitted directly. We can pick a reasonably short code for the
READ and WRITE commands, and see whether the overhead for them is
acceptable.

To be done generally, that information would have to be transmitted.
However, it will have a lot of overhead. Basically, the pointer to the next
table is defined as the series of huffman codes that would take you from the
root to that table. For deep tables, this information will be quite large, I
suspect. Its not clear it would be worth it.

That is certainly true, but thats not consistent with some other writings
that have been done on the subject of merged requests. I have come to the
conclusion that what is written in bis-04 is the right thing. It buys us the
very important capability for a proxy to retry a request by changing some
other things, so long as the via branch id changes.

The whole idea is *not* to make changes to the core protocol. Leave the
core protocol generic and application-agnostic, and add extensions that
only affect people that are interested in the particular feature.
Examples include, so far, the event model, reliable provisional,
manyfolks, refresh and a few others - if you don't care about these
features or they don't apply to your environment, you can blissfully
ignore them. This does cause us some pain now, as we have to avoid the
usual "design feature X into the protocol" trap, but yet allow enough
tools. The extension mechanisms and the now-emerging cleaned-up
generalized routing mechanism allow for this. (With hindsight, a
generalized reliability mechanism that avoided the 100rel and INVITE
special cases would have been nice, too, but that's hard to backfit.)

[Moved to SIP mailing list]

There are several additional constraints
that make the 3GPP problem a little more
difficult.

1) The UA doesn't know what it's home
   proxy is. The home proxy is chosen
   dynamically for the UA by the home
   network based on the required 
   capabilities needed to fulfill the
   user's service profile.

2) This selection of the home proxy 
   is done at registration time to
   reduce call setup times for the INVITE.
   The selection is then stored in a home
   entity "database" called the HSS. 
   To reduce load on the HSS, it is desired
   that it is not queried for this selection
   information on every INVITE.

3) There are situations where the home network
   wishes to introduce an intermediary between
   the visited network and the user's home proxy
   for the purpose of hiding the user' home proxy
   identity. This means that the number of hops
   between the local outbound proxy and the user's
   home proxy may be 1 or 2. This implies at least
   a loose route.

Loose routing to the home network would
require that an entity in the home network
query the HSS to complete the routing of
the request.

Given the above constaints, a solution involving
a "strict" pre-loaded route was made. This pre-loaded
route is communicated in the Path: header that is
used in the REGISTER/200 OK.

I personally dislike the Path: header solution.
If a better solution can be found, I am all for it.
I just wanted to explain the background behind the
Path: header choice.

I personally believe the issue of 
backwards compatibility at this point in
time is moot. The Route: header stuff has
changed dramatically since 2543. And I think
we are finding that it still is not quite 
right. What does backwards compatibility
mean if the old proxies are broken? 

We have three options:

1) Use a Proxy-Require:
2) Change to SIP/2.1 
3) Ignore backwards compatibility in this case

None of these are pretty, but (3) seems
the most straightforward way to continue.
Since 2543bis is going to be a recycled
Proposed Standard, is backwards compatibility
in this sense really important?

I think that will probably solve that aspect of the problem.

There is one more worth discussing. In loose routing, the header is popped
at the receiver, in strict, at the sender. This can cause problems. Here's
the example.

A UAC wants to call jo@foo.com through home.com. So, he sends an INVITE
like:

INVITE sip:jo@foo.com SIP/2.0
Route: sip:home.com;loose=true
Route: sip:jo@foo.com;loose=true

He sends this to the local outbound proxy of his visited domain,
outbound1.visit.com. That one supports loose routing. Recognizing that its
not home.com, it proxies the invite to its outbound proxy,
outbound2.visit.com, which also supports loose routing. That forwards it to
foo.com. This one also supports loose, so it pops off home.com, and sees
jo@foo.com. Now, it sends it to its outbound proxy, outbound1.foo.com. Now
here is the problem.

outbound1.foo.com doesn't support loose routing. So, it pops the top route,
puts it in the r-uri, and sends it there. This goes back to the foo.com
proxy, which now detects a loop, since it already saw a request with the
r-uri of foo.com.

Basically, you introduce the possibility of looping whenver you mix loose
and source routing, and have the r-uri equal to one of the loose routes
(which has to be the case anyway). Perhaps this is also fixable; if the
foo.com proxy includes a hash of the route headers in its branch-id
computation (which it probably should based on the bis-04 discussion on via
brnach id computation), the loop back around to foo.com will be detected as
a spiral. 

There may be other cases where this cannot be easily detected as a spiral; I
need to think about it.

Assuming we can nail that, it is my strong preference to keep this backwards
compatible. I know there are interop issues with route/rr since this has
evolved, but that is mostly because of the mix of incorrect implementations
along with the changing nature of this piece. If everyone implemented the
rfc2543 approach exactly as specified, you would find that what is
documented in bis 04 is totally backwards compatible. Juha's issue, for
example, of someone reversing the order of the routes, was never something
that was recommended or discussed, and is purely an implementation error on
their part. SHould we ditch backwards compatibility just because some people
have trouble implementing this stuff right? I don't think so.

I think there are really two separate use cases for the loose routing, and
that these are being confused. Remember, the definition of loose is that
there can be intermediate hops between the ones specified.

In one use case, I want some intermediate domain in the path of a message.
The specific server doesn't matter; a selection can be done by an upstream
proxy through SRV computations, for example. Any server in the intermediate
domain will do. I think this is the case for the "i'm visiting a hotel and
need my outbound calls through my home domain". 

In another use case, I need to go through a SPECIFIC proxy, that I've
learned previously. Presumably this is because it has some state specific to
me, established through whatever means I learned about it previously. I
don't care about intermediate hops, but I need to eventually hit THAT proxy.
This is the case for regular record-routed invites, where a called party may
need to send a re-INVITE through an outbound proxy not on the route list,
for example (Juha's original case). Its also the case for 3gpp, since they
have selected a particular proxy as a result of a previous transaction.

Now, in the case of 3gpp, I happen to think that the error was selecting a
particular proxy at registration time in the first place. I assume that
"capabilities required to fulfill the users profile" are things like
features and applications - call screening, etc. that need to be applied to
outbound calls. Trigger conditions for applications like this are frequently
not just subscriber specific, but also dependent on things like called party
and other dynamic criteria. Therefore, to me, it makes more sense to
partition users into sub-domains statically, either based on direct mappings
(which can be cached in a proxy) or algorithmicly. Within a sub-domain, the
call can be routed to any proxy. Each proxy has the triggering conditions
for applications for all users in the sub-domain. Based on those, it may
route a call to an application server for processing, using the
hub-and-spoke model that Jorgen describes in his draft he just posted.
Trigger conditions are also fairly static and can therefore be cached.

This eliminates the need for database dips at all for call setup, and also
eliminates the need for the path header or pre-recording anything. The user
in the visited domain knows his home domain, home.com, and it is sufficient
to use a loose route to get the request to his home. The architecture I
describe above handles the rest.

Maybe someone can clarify why that was not found to be sufficient by the 3g
guys? A related question is this - don't you need to dip the HSS anyway for
incoming calls, to find out which proxy the user is associated with? So you
are eliminating this extra DB load in only half the cases anyway (note that
my proposal above completely eliminates the need for a DB dip).

This is fine also. My arguments apply equally well to that case.

why can't the proxy of mobileoperator.com proxy the message further to
the right proxy if the one returned from dns is not the correct one?

i don't buy the load argument.  there can be many load balanced hss'es
like there are many load balanced dns servers, web caches, etc.

again, the dns can in such a situation return the intermediary, which
forwards the message to the real proxy.  this is what we do all the
time today:  our pstn proxy is not even directly reachable from the
internet.

so what?  again, i don't buy the load argument.  this is exactly what

good, then there is still a change unless the real reason is something

Hmmm....  This was not my understanding of the proposal.
I thought that if you used the Route:, you popped as
currently specified; however, obeying the Route: was
totally optional.

[And there would be no "loose" parameter because of
the omission of extension-params from Route: in 2543.]

Here's where I think I'm proposing different.  If
the outbound2.visit.com proxy supported loose routing,
it would know that "home.com" was the next important
stop, and thus be aiming for there.

Argh.  I think I'm really misunderstanding this
example.  Why is "home.com" proxied now -- we
haven't even hit there yet.  Or was the "forward
to foo.com" a shouldhavebeen "forward to home.com"?

Hmmm....  Okay.   So a long long long time ago, when
we were thrashing in the Sea of Record-Route Pain
(i.e., trying to define a backwardly-compatible
approach that worked in the reverse direction), you
[Jonathan] proposed that proxies did not do loop
detection when Route headers were present.

In fact, I would argue that this is still necessary.
If a Proxy spirals in an initial INVITE, and
Record-Route:s on both "parts" of a spiral.  Then if
the called party in this INVITE was 2543, any requests
in the reverse direction will look like loops to this
Proxy.

Agreed. &:)

If you put users in a sub-domain it would initially provide relief but now
the service provider has to manage multiple sub-domains and consensually
update records and create new sub-domain names to correspond with additional
users and/or applications.  If the sub-domains are not closely monitored
than you have the same issue as in a domain just with a <something.> in
front.  Sounds like a operation issue in time.

Thx,

I think there are really two separate use cases for the loose routing, and
that these are being confused. Remember, the definition of loose is that
there can be intermediate hops between the ones specified.

In one use case, I want some intermediate domain in the path of a message.
The specific server doesn't matter; a selection can be done by an upstream
proxy through SRV computations, for example. Any server in the intermediate
domain will do. I think this is the case for the "i'm visiting a hotel and
need my outbound calls through my home domain". 

In another use case, I need to go through a SPECIFIC proxy, that I've
learned previously. Presumably this is because it has some state specific to
me, established through whatever means I learned about it previously. I
don't care about intermediate hops, but I need to eventually hit THAT proxy.
This is the case for regular record-routed invites, where a called party may
need to send a re-INVITE through an outbound proxy not on the route list,
for example (Juha's original case). Its also the case for 3gpp, since they
have selected a particular proxy as a result of a previous transaction.

Now, in the case of 3gpp, I happen to think that the error was selecting a
particular proxy at registration time in the first place. I assume that
"capabilities required to fulfill the users profile" are things like
features and applications - call screening, etc. that need to be applied to
outbound calls. Trigger conditions for applications like this are frequently
not just subscriber specific, but also dependent on things like called party
and other dynamic criteria. Therefore, to me, it makes more sense to
partition users into sub-domains statically, either based on direct mappings
(which can be cached in a proxy) or algorithmicly. Within a sub-domain, the
call can be routed to any proxy. Each proxy has the triggering conditions
for applications for all users in the sub-domain. Based on those, it may
route a call to an application server for processing, using the
hub-and-spoke model that Jorgen describes in his draft he just posted.
Trigger conditions are also fairly static and can therefore be cached.

This eliminates the need for database dips at all for call setup, and also
eliminates the need for the path header or pre-recording anything. The user
in the visited domain knows his home domain, home.com, and it is sufficient
to use a loose route to get the request to his home. The architecture I
describe above handles the rest.

Maybe someone can clarify why that was not found to be sufficient by the 3g
guys? A related question is this - don't you need to dip the HSS anyway for
incoming calls, to find out which proxy the user is associated with? So you
are eliminating this extra DB load in only half the cases anyway (note that
my proposal above completely eliminates the need for a DB dip).

my point was that every sip proxy in anykind of production service needs
to be currently upgraded many times per year because of all kinds of
bugs and new features.  we are not in that stable state in the industry
yet, that backwards compatibility would be any real issue in proxies.
it may be an issue for UAs, because some of them are not supported
anymore.

Hmm. I hadn't thought about that. It is more likely than you think,
particularly in the case where its a stateless proxy that is implementing
this. Stateless proxies never have transaction state, so CANCEL is routed in
the same way the INVITE was routed. Maybe you can argue that stateless
proxies can't really implement caller prefs, and that may be true. I've come
to the conclusion that stateless proxies can only implement very static
routing logic, since otherwise if the routing logic changes mid-transaction,
your call is split into two directions, and you're stateless proxy has
accidentally forked, which can be very bad in some cases. 

Now, since caller prefs is mostly useful for routing based on registrations,
which can change, I would argue that a stateless proxy shouldn't implement
caller prefs, and would propose adding text to that regard.

The problem still remains of error cases, but this is definitely well into
unlikelyland, and doesn't seem important enough to worry about.

Good catch. This is the danger of repeating main sip spec stuff in
extensions. I will strike this sentence entirely, and rather say, "a pending
call can be terminated as described in rfc2543".

Changed.

The text does say that, and doesn't recommend it for that reason. 
Its really just stating what you can do anyway. I think its harmless,
and if anything, explicitly calling out that usage of Require is not
recommended
is probably a good thing.

Since I suspect 20 rules is way more than would ever be needed in any real
scenario, I think  SHOULD is fine here.

Thanks for your comments,

Hi,

The SIP URL syntax allows only alphanum and '-' for the hostname part of the SIP URL.
Is it by design to prevent the use of other characters in the domain name ?

Thanks
Ajay.

As I understand it, the restriction if for conformance with DNS,  which is
what translates those hostnames into IP addresses.  For example, the "_"
character (underscore) has historically been invalid in DNS. It's only
recently appeared as a valid restricted character for delimiting protocol
names in SRV records.

There's probably ongoing work on internationalizaing DNS, but it's not going
to be easy.

RE: [Sipping] Loose Routing ProposalOk, I think I see herein a proposal =
to change the fundamental route/record-route action in SIP.

1) Add type modifier syntax for loose and strict to Route and =
Record-Route

2) Switch to "pop on receive" rather than "pop on send".

3) Use hostnames instead of URLs to indicate route-nodes, or at least =
depecate the "user@" part. RL does retain some advantage from a DNS SRV =
perspective.

4) Stop rewriting the request URI when exercising a route. Do IP routers =
change the target address of a packet when forwarding the packet to a =
next hop router? nope.

I think this would actually be a very useful cleanup of what I see as a =
really confusing part of the specification.

Of course, the backward compatibility story here would be "not good".  =
Once could always increment the version number or declare it "not a =
problem".

The current DNS and (standard-compliant) registrars only allow ASCII.
See RFC 1035 and the IDNS effort. Once this is resolved, it is likely
that domain names will be UTF-8 "externally" (they may be some strange
transformation deeper down), so implementations are well advised not to
be too picky about the characters in that URL.

See, for example, http://www.register.com/domain-rules.cgi

Looks fine to me too.

Note, however, that the scenario of a proxy getting an INVITE not for it
should never happen. ACK-200 should be Routed, and ACK for non-200 goes hBh
right to the server that generated the response.

Yeah that's what made me misread it - there are normally no "subsequent
requests" for ACK's to non-200 responses. I can only think that this was
trying to cover the 3xx response case when a new request is generated after
receiving the redirect.

Including stateless proxies? My understanding was they just forwarded
everything.

"Stateless Proxy: A logical entity that does not maintain state
             for a SIP transaction. A stateless proxy forwards every
             request it receives downstream and every response it
             receives upstream."

Agreed. This is the fundamental premise of the UDPComp proposal.

I am still concerned about the overhead of indicating how to connect the
digraph together.

User specific and static dictionaries can all be supported by a single
decoder capability - the ability to set a codebook entry without
constructing decoder output. With this, the encoder could transfer the user
specific and static codebooks at init time of the session (presumably before
a call is made). 

Cross session and shared dictionaries do require additional context
management.

BTW, can we get a concise definition of session? I am confused about exactly
what "dynamic dictionary across sessions" means. Session, in the SIP
defintiion, means something very different than I think you mean.

I think it is supported with a tree structured mechanism. Here's how it
would work:

Say you have a template that looks like:

A<x>BCD<y>

Where <x> and <y> are variables, and A,B,C,D are "constants for that
specific template. You have a bunch of templates like this. At init time,
the encoder sends codebook information to the decoder (this requires the
ability to operate as if you were sending a message, but you are just
performing the codebook manipulations, not generating output). The root of
the codebook tree contains empty outputs, but basically uses the "next
codebook" as the top of each template:

ROOT CB
-------

0    <null output> next CB = CB 1
01   <null output> next CB = CB 2
.....


Now, consider CB 1 which is the codebook for the template above. CB 1 would
have a single entry:

CB 1
-----

0   "A"  next CB = CB 3

Then, CB 3 contains, initially, some random thing, and values for the
variable x will go in this CB:

CB 3
-----

0   "whatever" next CB = CB 4

CB 4 looks like:

CB 4
----

0   BCD  next CB = CB 5


CB 5 contains the variable y, and is initialized to some random thing
initially. 

The primitive commands one would use to build this initially are:

WRITE_NO_OUTPUT, top=true, code = 0, value = ""
WRITE_NO_OUTPUT, top=false, code=0, value = "A"
WRITE_NO_OUTPUT, top=false, code=0, value="whatever"
WRITE_NO_OUTPUT, top=false, code=0, value="BCD"

WRITE_NO_OUTPUT is a new primitive that writes to the codebook but generates
no decoder output.

OK, now, when a request comes to be compressed, lets say we got:

AhelloBCDfoo

We would send:

0
0
WRITE, top=false, code=01, value ="hello"
0
WRITE, top=false, code=01, value="foo"


The overhead here is small; as good as log2(number of templates) + (number
of variables) + the overhead of indicating WRITE plus the codebook indices
of each string.

Thats pretty good, I think.

Where does the requirement for unidirectional links come from, exactly? Is
that realistic?

Why is

[Aaron] This mechanism makes sense in 2-party case. However, in the
multi-party case, we may want to restrict to a uniform mode of
communication as per above discussion. What we have now is only the
ability to tell that the REFERral has failed and why it has failed. I
think we can do better by having REFER specify the media type so the
referred can decline the REFER if it sees it cannot connect with the
specified media type.

It has been two weeks since I posted this. 

There were no responses. Since there was consensus on this at IETF, I will
now assume list consensus on this, and therefore close this open issue.

This note contained my proposed resolution to open issue #58 on rejected
mid-call SDP.

The proposal was to simply require a UA to return its current SDP in the
re-INVITE with no SDP (i.e., it MUST offer the SDP currently in use). Since
this SDP has already been agreed to, there is no need to ever reject it, so
the problem goes away. This is the simplest solution. 

Since no one objected to this proposal, I am now considering this issue
closed. THe SHOULD will be changed to a MUST.

It has been two weeks since I posted this note. The resolution described
below was agreed to at IETF 51. There was no comment on my note, so I will
now assume list consensus exists as well. As such, this issue is closed.

Thanks,

It has been over two weeks since I sent this.

There was consensus on this issue at IETF. As there was no response to my
post, I will assume there is consensus on this on the list as well. I will
clarify this in bis 05, and this issue is now closed.

Thanks,

This thread has stalled. Since this is a bis open issue, I would like people
to please make a priority of getting this resolved.

Some comments below.

Using an explicit stream ID would definitely make this issue go away. It
would also solve this particular issue for bis - the base spec disallows
reuse. If you want to reuse, you need to implement the FID extension that
supports this. Allowing reuse is not backwards compatible anyway.

However, its not clear to me that FID, as currently specified, has this
semantic. Here, we are talking about using the stream ID to correlate
streams ACROSS re-invites. I don't think it means that. Its currently meant
to associate streams together within a single INVITE/2xx. I'd appreciate
input from Gonzalo and the mmusic folks about whether or not this usage
fits, and/or should be added, to the fid draft.

These are unrelated. I don't see an issue.

Forgetting about reusing stream slots, if you do a re-invite with a new set
of codecs, there is no need to retain the list of old codecs, and their pt.
THus, this information is normally lost anyway. I'm not sure it matters.

I do not see why that is needed. The only thing you need to recover is the
current state, not the history. You don't have the history normally anyway.

Billing and accounting information (recovery).

It might also be useful as a positive negative to indicate
that was a past history (or at least one end point believes
so) that no longer exists.  This may be useful in recovering
state for certain services (like making sure any open firewall
ports from previous streams are closed, stopping billing for
selfsame, etc.)

Sounds fine with me.  However I guess that the 
"MUST" will have implications for devices that 
can't or don't distinguish between INVITE and 
re-INVITE after having underwent a restart.
I guess that these UA's would have to persist 
parts of the SDP if they wish to allow a 
re-INVITE without SDP to re-establish a call
(which I don't recommend).

Its been two weeks since I posted this. There was consensus on this at IETF,
and I now interpret the lack of responses to this to imply broader list
consensus. The proposed text will be incorporated into bis-05.

Thanks,

Also why does the user part of the URI allow only escaped characters and not full UTF8 minus {some reserved characters required for parsing) ? 
When UTF-8 domain names become a reality will a similar approach be followed for hostname part as well ?

Thanks
Ajay.

The current DNS and (standard-compliant) registrars only allow ASCII.
See RFC 1035 and the IDNS effort. Once this is resolved, it is likely
that domain names will be UTF-8 "externally" (they may be some strange
transformation deeper down), so implementations are well advised not to
be too picky about the characters in that URL.

See, for example, http://www.register.com/domain-rules.cgi

Domain names are the same thing as host names. I'm inquiring with
authorities on naming about other URL components.

It has been two weeks since I posted this, with no comments. Since this
proposal was agreed to at IETF 51, and indeed is already in bis-04, I will
now consider this issue closed. The current wording stays.

I agree that thats ugly.

I suppose that we could say that its a MUST to use the existing SDP if you
know it. A UA that sends a re-INVITE w/o SDP MUST be prepared for SDP that
may be different for the reason you describe. Hopefully its something
acceptable. If its not, BYE the call. I don't think we can reasonably do
better. We're already talking about the case where the UA has failed and
recovered.

Sound OK?

Well, the proposal was pretty much that. It does nothing. Just respond to
it. The point is that a client MUSTNOT send it anymore (i.e., its deprecated
as it doesn't do anything useful).

Right. It wasn't the proposal to respond with a 405. Just a 200 OK, in fact.

> - Does anything else get simpler if we disallow CANCEL for non-INVITE?

The thing we want to get rid of is the usage in the client, and the
processing that, in theory, would need to happen in the server if this was
more than a no-op. For example, cancelling a SUBSCRIBE or something would
cause the subscription state to be destroyed, and a 487 to the SUBSCRIBE to
be sent. With the proposal, the server just 200 OKs the CANCEL, and
otherwise ignores it. No deletion of state. No generating of a special
response to SUBSCRIBE.

Well, except that you still need to cotninue retransmitting the request at
5s intervals to trigger a response. This is wasteful, and results in slow
transactions. I had thought that we had agreed as a group that non-INVITE
requests really needed to be responded to immediately to be effective.

Yes.  IMO, in the case a UA has failed and recovered it's reasonable to
expect problems in sessions that involve "complicated" media negotiation.
In more common cases, session re-establishment should work fine.

Sorry I wasn't clear.
I meant once UTF-8 domain names are a reality will the hostname part allow escaped characters (similar to the user part in today's syntax) or will it allow UTF-8 in general.
Also could you comment on why the user part doesn't allow UTF-8 in general and allows only escaped characters.

Thanks
Ajay.

Domain names are the same thing as host names. I'm inquiring with
authorities on naming about other URL components.

Sounds fine if the above text also includes 
the portion from your original recommendation 
concerning the connection address and port 
potentially changing.  This would specifically 
be for those devices that respond to holds 
with holds.  I guess that it would also have
to accommodate for the new hold SDP format 
that is being discussed.

The "MUST" also prevents a 3PCC/B2BUA from 
using a re-INVITE without SDP to potentially 
get the UA to send an SDP with all media that 
it would like to use.  However I guess that 
this is acceptable since the 3PCC shouldn't be 
a necessary interface to establish these extra 
media streams for an established call.

Subject: [Sip] Translate header in draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt

Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org
X-Mailman-Version: 1.0
Precedence: bulk

Hi,

In draft-ietf-sip-nat-00.txt, Jonathan describes a new header called the 
Translate header that is used to translate the Contact in a REGISTER into 
the address received for that Contact in the received and rport Via parameters.

Based on my quick read of the draft, it seems that Registration Servers 
which are not co-located with the "first proxy", are unable to perform the 
proper Translate magic.

UA --- NAT --- Proxy ----Registration Server

To get around this problem (if it exists), and to avoid adding an extra 
header, I propose instead that the UA "lie" in its REGISTER.  The UA would 
generate a new Contact from its public IP address and port if it discovers 
received and rport parameters in its own Via header.  For example...

REGISTER domain.org SIP/2.0
Via: 10.1.1.1:5060;rport
To: user@domain.org
From: user@domain.org
Contact: user@10.1.1.1:5060

SIP/2.0 200 OK
Via: 10.1.1.1:5060;received=77.68.24.3;rport=8734
...

REGISTER domain.org SIP/2.0
Via: 10.1.1.1:5060;rport
To: user@domain.org
From: user@domain.org
Contact: user@77.68.24.3:8734

Unfortunately, if the first proxy after the NAT is actually a cluster of 
load-sharing proxies we have a problem.  (I believe this was part of the 
problem Translate attempts to solve). Consider a new INVITE coming from the 
world:
		

           /-- proxy 1
          /
UA -- NAT --- proxy 2    <---- INVITE user@domain.org    UA
          \
           \-- proxy 3

Depending on the type of NAT, three things may happen:

1) For a fully promiscuous cone NAT, the INVITE from any of the proxies 
will arrive safely at the UA.

2) For a partial cone NAT, the UA will only receive the INVITE if it is 
delivered by the proxy that last handled registrations.

The UA could insure that a cone mapping is open by sending an OPTIONS or 
other SIP request to each member of the cluster.  Discovering the cluster 
members is the tricky part.  DNS may provide enough information, but it is 
hard to determine topology and intent from DNS.

cluster.proxies.com	IN A	12.1.1.1
			IN A	12.1.1.2
			IN A	12.1.1.3

3) For a fully symetric NAT, the UA has several ugly choices:
a) keep a translation to each proxy and register from each translated address
b) register yourself to a specific proxy (if this even works):

	REGISTER sip:domain.org
	From: user@domain.org
	Contact: user@12.1.1.2:5060	

	REGISTER sip:12.1.1.2
	From: user@12.1.1.2
	Contact: user@77.68.24.3:8734

c) register yourself with a preloaded loose Route (illegal and YUCK!)

	REGISTER
	Contact: user@77.68.24.3:8734?Route=12.1.1.2:5060;route-type=loose

d) use some shared-IP address load-sharing device in front of the proxies.

Any thoughts?

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

I have a few quick nits on caller-prefs while I have a few minutes of last 
call left.  ;-)

1) Does the behavior of "cancel-feature" in Request Disposition on page 12 
depend on the resolution of bis open issue #122?

2) on page 2  proposed rewording: "a script written in [CPL]"  -> "some 
type of scripting language such as CPL"

3) need a Full Copyright Statement at the end of the draft

4) typo bottom of page 3  "prefernces" -> "preferences"

Hi,

Based on Jonathan's open issues presentation ( 
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf51/slides/pres-jdrosen-sip_bis_open 
-ietf51.ppt ), and the closure of 6 of those issues on the list last night, 
I count 19 open issues remaining, of which 7 are CANCEL related, and 7 are 
SDP related.  Perhaps if we discuss these in a group, we might close them 
faster.

The following 7 open issues are all related to SDP processing:
I've also added my own comments/proposals/2 cents inline:

 >#21  "SDP uni/multi processing rules too granular"
 >SDP section defines processing separately for multicast and unicast
 >BUT, does so at the level of entire SDP.  An SDP can have a mix of both.
 >Proposal: Restructure appendix to treat uni/multi on a stream by stream basis
 >
 >#26 "misaligned SDP"
 >Bis-02 used to say that a UA SHOULD be prepared to handle misaligned SDP
 >Gave some vague guidelines what to do, not clear what it means
 >Bis-03 has removed this.  General rule: error handling is your own concern
 >No comments received on this removal, this feature had been discussed on
 >list.  Is this OK?
 >Proposal: yes
 >
 >#133 "on-hold indication"
 >Using 0.0.0.0 on-hold has some issues:
 >No IP for receiving receiver reports, IPv4 specific, Makes no sense for
 >connection oriented media, IP change may require change in security context.
 >Be explicit, not implicit
 >Proposal:
 >Use a=sendonly for bidirectional media,
 >Use a=inactive for recvonly,
 >Must still be prepared to receive 0.0.0.0 for backwards compatibility, but
 >don't send anymore,
 >No other explicit hold indicator needed
 >
 >#150 "saying don't send"  (related to #133)
 >Spec has many ways to say "don't send me media":
 >A=sendonly, A=inactive, Bw=0, Port zero, 0.0.0.0
 >Do we need all of these??
 >Answer: no, but we need several:
 >A=sendonly stops receipt of media
 >A=inactive stops RTP/RTCP in both directions
 >Port zero terminates media stream (stop tools)
 >All others not needed
 >OK?
 >
 >#163 "where does SDP section live"
 >Issues: SIP spec has an appendix with SDP usage;
 >Not really a SIP issue at all;
 >Other descriptions will come along;
 >Sync issue with SDP spec;
 >Beefiness of SIP spec already
 >Some ideas: Separate RFC, Incorporate into SDP revision, Keep it as it is
 >Proposal: Keep it as it is

rohan>  I support all the above proposals #21, #26, #133, #150, & #163.
rohan>  Also I thought that we already tentatively closed #133 at the 51st 
(there were no objections).

 >#73   "responding to held SDP with held SDP"  (interacts w/ #133)
 >If a UA receives an INVITE with held SDP, does it respond with held SDP?
 >Bis-03+ says NO (This has been discussed on list extensively prior to
 >bis-03)  Few comments on resolution: want broader input.

rohan> a UA should respond to held SDP with whatever SDP they would have 
offered.  In other words, you shouldn't respond with held SDP just because 
you receive held SDP (which I believe was the intent of bis-03), but if 2 
IP phones want to go "on-hold" at the same time, I don't see why there is 
anything wrong with that (especially with the proposed "inactive" attribute 
in #133)

 >#146  Re-use disabled streams
 >Spec says that once you've disabled a stream (port zero) you can't reuse it.
 >Result is that SDP size increases as you disable/add streams
 >Why? MUST maintain implicit ordering of codecs
 >Problem is increasing size of SDP--Issue for 3gpp it seems
 >Proposal: Can never remove a disabled stream, But, if you add a new one, it
 >can take disabled streams' "slot" within SDP. Can be totally 
different >media. This keeps ordering without increasing size of SDP

rohan>  the proposal is entirely reasonable.  the only objections where 
philisophical that you should instead use the fid.  I think implementations 
should be able to use either mechanism, so i would change the proposed 
wording to something like this: "MAY NOT remove a disabled stream unless an 
explicit ordering system is used."

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

Based on Jonathan's open issues presentation ( 
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf51/slides/pres-jdrosen-sip_bis_open 
-ietf51.ppt ), and the closure of 6 of those issues on the list last night, 
I count 19 open issues remaining, of which 7 are CANCEL related, and 7 are 
SDP related.  Perhaps if we discuss these in a group, we might close them 
faster.

The following open issues are all related to CANCEL.
I've addded my comments/proposals/2 cents inline:

#7   "CANCEL for non-INVITE"
 >Spec allows CANCEL for non-INVITE. Why is that silly?
 >Non-INVITE must be answered immediately, CANCEL usage therefore always a
 >race condition.
 >Why does it make sense? May still be human interaction, Timeouts  wish to
 >give up when no response comes
 >Proposal:  remove
[also reference recent list discussions]

rohan> i think CANCEL for non-INVITEs is a waste of bits in the spec.  if 
you get a cancel for non-INVITE, just send a 200 and be done.

#72  "CANCEL for multicast"
 >Spec says that servers send no response to a multicast CANCEL
 >How does client know when to stop retransmitting?  No way!
 >Proposals:
 >1) Never send CANCEL over multicast
 >2) Never send SIP over multicast
 >3) Just continue retransmitting until timeout
 >4) Send CANCEL responses over multicast (May need to limit scope)

rohan>  I propose the first option: (never cancel over multicast), although 
the second (deprecate SIP over Multicast) is also acceptable to me.

#118 "481 then BYE"  (OK not really a CANCEL issue, but similar)
 >Bis-04 says that if you get a 481 to INVITE, consider the call leg down
 >Question: should you send BYE?
 >Proposal: YES!
 >Why?  Dont want to change fact that mid-call re-INVITE failures dont
 >terminate call.  One way to terminate calls
 >[If media streams from A->B generate errors to A, or RTCP times out,
 >re-INVITE to B.  If that generates 481, then BYE]

rohan> I concur with the proposal.

#121 "reason codes for CANCEL/BYE"
 >Would like to have BYE/CANCEL Reason phrases/codes
 >- Compatible with PSTN
 >- Differing UA behaviors depending on reason for CANCEL
 >- UA hangup vs. other branch completed (drop to voicemail!)
 >- 3pcc treatments
 >Issue: what codes to use
 >Proposal: existing response codes/reason phrases
 >Mostly for 3pcc case
 >But: need more! Like why CANCEL was sent in forking case

rohan> This is new functionality, and does not belong in bis IMO.  Some 
draft such as Visited or cc-diversion could easily provide this type of 
information.

#122  "cancel on 200/600 strength"
 >When a forking proxy gets a 2xx/6xx on a branch, is CANCEL of other branches
 >a: 1) MAY, 2) MUST, or 3) SHOULD
 >Bis-03 and previous were MAY, -04 is SHOULD
 >Why?  Without cancellation, burden moves to UA; UA doesnt know if proxy
 >forked!  Would always need to send CANCEL after 2xx
 >Why not?  Useful apps for not cancelling
 >Proposal:  change to MUST, MAY use caller-prefs to turn off

#130  "BYE vs. CANCEL"
 >To hang up a call before a final response, does the UAC
 >1) BYE, no tags
 >2) CANCEL, then BYE if 2xx
 >3) CANCEL + BYE no tags
 >Related: can CANCEL have tags to be directed
 >Related: can you send BYE for a 1xx early leg
 >Proposal:
 >CANCEL for all, then BYE on 2xx
 >You can terminate a particular early leg with BYE w/ tags
 >[CANCEL w/ tags is worse since: No bodies, Not e2e]

rohan> I concur with both proposals (#122 & #130)

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

I am proposing closure of open issue #71 on RTT estimation using the 
Timestamp header.
The open issue is that the spec doesn't describe how to estimate RTT in the 
face of retransmits.

I propose changing the following text to make this a local implementation 
issue:

From:
"The timestamp is used by the client to compute the RTT to the server so it 
can adjust the timeout value for retransmission"

To:
"The timestamp MAY be used ...

this clarifies that this is purely optional behavior and local 
implementation heuristics.

comments or objections?

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

Doesn't the tag tell if it's an INVITE or a re-INVITE? 

I think we discussed this issue earlier, but I don't remember what was
the issue back then...

Hi,

I THINK that the FID currently doesn't support the identifying of
streams for the whole sessions. However, I see no reason why it
shouldn't be possible to update the draft (I guess Gonzalo is the man to
make that decission), or otherwise write a new draft. We may even want
to define more new stream related attributes, so maybe the name should
be "SIP multimedia support", or something...

Of course, IF we would put the whole media handling in a specific draft,
the question is if this would be included there too.

I don't see too big backward compability issues with this - since it
currently simply doesn't work. And, if needed it is always possible to
define an option-tag for the feature, so...

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Hi,

A couple of small comments/questions on the manyfolks draft:


Chapter 12.1.

The text says that the 180 Rining provisional response is also sent
using the reliability mechanism, ie PRACK. 

First, I would like to have it as a MUST/SHOULD/MAY/whatever - just to
clarify.

Second, it if is a MUST I would like to know why. I DO understand why
the 183 needs PRACK in this scenario, but why the 180?


Chapter 13.

First, since it has been decided that forking WILL be a part of the
spec, I think that the idea of having a chapter like this in the draft
is very good (more on that in another thread).

Anyway, since we now do support the sending of BYE for a specific call
leg, using the tag, before the call is established, I think it could be
added to this chapter. Ie would not be mandatory to do multiple resource
reservation.

Hi,

First, I am NOT going to propose the removal of forking :) I will,
however, give some comments.

I mentioned this issue in another mail (my comments about the manyfolks
draft), but I will take it up here too.

So, I guess most of us agree that forking does produce a number of
problems in different scenario. And, sometimes when we have a cool SIP
extension we later find out that it doesn't always work with forking.

So, the following proposal came up when I read the manyfolks draft: why
not always, in every SIP extension draft, include a chapter how the
specific extension/feature works in a working environment. That way, if
the author takes that into consideration from the beginning, we don't
have to start thinking of it 6 months later when the draft is supposed
to go for last call... And, if someone comes up with something, but it
does NOT work in a forking environment, it should at least be mentioned
that it doesn't work in a forking environment. It will then be easier to
decide if it's worth making a WG item in the first place. 

Comments?

Hi,

Should we put some lines in the bis about the issue of a proxy CHANGING
an established route, Is a ie by REMOVING its own, or someone elses,
R-R/R headers?

Hi,

My personal opinion is that we, like Henning said, simply should have a
error code telling "sorry, I can't cancel the specific request". Of
course we can, if needed, also have different error codes for request
that can't be cancelled because a final response has been sent, and
another code for requests that the UAS simply doesn't allow - for any
reason - the UAC to CANCEL.

For example, even if we most likely always will accept a CANCEL for the
initial INVITE, there are many cases where we may not accept a CANCEL
for a re-INVITE. 

Eg, if I receive a re-INVITE to change some codecs, I may not accept a
CANCEL. EVEN if I would be smart enough to remember the previous codecs
it is not even sure that I have resources to change them back. In that
case we would need a code saying "well, I did CANCEL your re-INVITE, but
now I am not able to put the old codecs back, so it would probably be a
good idea to release the whole call". No, I don't think we want that...
Another thinkg would be for the UAS to send a BYE, since it can't put
the codecs back, but I don't think we want that either, so...

I thought it was Appendix B that was to go to a separate draft, have I

I have no problem with removing it, but there seem to be some requirements
here that I am not convinced are in the existing main body, e.g. on a quick
look I was not able to find the equivalent of the first sentence of A.2 in
the main body.

Perhaps the removal process should be accompanied by a process of making
sure the requirements are also in the main body - assuming they are all
still relevent, I do not mind discussing proposals to delete specific
requirements.

Certainly ensuring that the requirements are integrated in the main text
rather than separately defined in annex A will ensure a more readable and
consistent document.

I too am not going to propose the removal of forking, but I have some
questions regarding forking which I think should be resolved in the bis
draft.

I posted the following mail almost a month ago and have not received any
response. So here I reformulate the questions :

1) If a forking proxy can silently discard 4xx/5xx responses to
   early call legs because there were 2xx, 3xx or 6xx responses,
   how would the UAC know if an early call leg is still alive? There
   may be resources reserved for the early call leg and the UAC
   does not know if a 2xx response is still to come.

2) So a UAC can be unaware that an early call leg has been
    terminated by the UAS as the 4xx/5xx was 'swallowed' by
    the forking proxy. What happens if the UAC tries the terminate
    such an early call leg with a BYE (with a To tag), or if the UAC
    tries to send requests such as PRACK or INFO (with To tag)
    on such an early call leg? Would the proxy respond with 481
    (Transaction Does Not Exist) ?

3) The last paragraph of the following mail proposed a re-wording of
    the forking section of bis-04. What is your opinion on this
    proposal ?

- Ya-Ching

| 
| 
| Figure 3 and Figure 5 of draft-rosenberg-sip-early-media-00 do not show
the
| correct handling of the 489 response (10) by the forking proxy. Figure 3
| shows that the 489 response is forwarded immediately upstream by the
forking
| proxy. According to the bis draft, for 4xx/5xx response received by the
| forking proxy, "the proxy MUST send an ACK. It remembers the response if
it
| has a lower status code class than any previous 4xx and 5xx response. On
| completion, a response with the lowerst response class is returned if
there
| were no 2xx, 3xx or 6xx responses". A SIP bis-compliant forking proxy
would
| therefore silently discard this 489 response, and forward only the 200 OK
| (19) upstream to the UAC.
| 
| This brings us to a question concerning "early call leg". J. Rosenberg
| proposed in an earlier SIP mail that "a 1xx with tags and record-routes
| establish an early call leg. Within that early call leg, you can send
| non-INVITE requests, including PRACK, INFO, BYE, etc., as you would for an
| answered call leg". But how would the client be aware that the forking
proxy
| has received a non-2xx final response and as a result, that particular
early
| call leg has been terminated ?
| 
| We therefore propose the following slight modification of forking proxy
| behavior to section 17.4 (Forking Proxy) of the bis draft :
| 
| Once the forking proxy has received and forwarded a provisional response
| with a To tag upstream, it MUST forward upstream any final non-2xx
responses
| received on that branch, regardless of the responses received on the other
| branches. On branches where no provisional responses with To tag were
| received, the forking proxy behaves as usual, by selecting the "best
| available final status" for those branches.

This is a good question. I mentioned before, when we discussed the
CANCEL/BYE of specific legs, that the UAC may not want to accept the
first final response - not even if it is 200 OK. Instead, the UAC may
make the decission which final response it will accept based on some
information in the provisional responses. But, as you said, if the final
response then never arrives no call will be established, and resources
will remain reserved (until the UAC realises that there will be no final
response).

Of course, it COULD be an extension feature (defined as a Proxy-Require
option-tag) to make sure that ALL final responses are sent back to the
UAC.

Probably. That, however, would probably not be a very big problem on a
functional level, since the UAC is going to forget about the leg in any
case - no matter what response code it receives.

Part of the problem with this discussion is that we seem to be coming
from two, I believe, valid but different conclusions:

- CANCEL for non-INVITE is not generally useful
- We don't know whether there will be methods or cases where it might
help

My argument is that we don't know what things we need in the future.
Unlike other features, CANCEL is a "socially responsible" extension,
i.e., it does not in any way inconvenience those that have no use for
it. UACs that don't need it can ignore its existence; UASs and proxies
just have to respond like to any other unknown method.

I see no complexity advantage in that. It would only be sent in
scenarios where it makes sense to the participants, as an optimization.

Responding to a method you don't understand or didn't act on with a 200
seems odd.

Again, this is purely consensual. SIP is a tool kit. I like to keep a
few odd tools around, particularly if they don't clutter the basement.
In general, if you don't like or need CANCEL, don't implement it.

Again, in almost all circumstances, this is correct. However, this is a
mechanism that may, in terms of messaging complexity, beat alternatives,
such as splitting the transaction into multiple ones. Also, I expect
that this will be the exception for a particular method. In other words,
a very high fraction of requests will complete immediately, but because
of some special circumstance (slow server, special processing, failover,
what have you), an occasional transaction takes longer.

One analogy is ^C in Unix: almost all commands terminate almost
immediately and ^C is not helpful. However, on occasion, a command does
something unexpected and takes much longer (often, because of some
temporary failure such as an NFS volume that disappeared) and it is very
useful to be able to get rid of it. General timeout doesn't help, since
in other cases you want the request to keep trying.

Hi Jonathan,

A colleague of mine asked me this question related to SIP over
TCP: does UDPComp imply the compression of SIP over TCP is
not considered? I don't think the answer is yes but I'm
wondering too why your I-D is UDP oriented (it doesn't
need to be).

BR,
Zhigang

I've clipped this description from Rohan Mahy's note, assuming it reflects
Jonathan's statement:

The implication of the decision on this issue is either that the negotiation
model for SDP is application-specific (implication if the SDP annex stays)
or that the negotiation model is general (implication if the annex becomes a
separate document in MMUSIC).

Megaco might be a bit different if a general document on SDP negotiation had
been available in 1999.  As it is, we built specific support for our model
into the Megaco protocol.

My point is that we should consider what is the best approach looking
forward.  When SDPng comes along, will we again face the necessity of
defining how it is used with each application, or will it be possible to
define a common view?

My personal preference is for a common document.  I think it is possible,
although it may contain different sections governing the operation of
different functions.  For example, there may be a difference in the model
used to reveal capabilities (a Megaco requirement), as opposed to
negotiating a specific media flow (a requirement common to Megaco and SIP).

Here I disagree.  CANCEL cancels a transaction in progress. 
Bis and guidelines are very explicit now in stating that new 
methods should not have extended delays before responding.  
We have a general model that shows that CANCELing a 
transaction only makes sense for transactions that do not 
have immediate responses.  Only INVITE is allowed to do 
this, so only INVITE transactions can be CANCELed.

I agree that it may be useful to cancel things other than 
transactions, but those are new methods or mechanisms.  
Specifically, SUBSCRIBE and REFER both have ways to cancel 
subscriptions (unsubscriptions) and triggered INVITEs (REFER 
with method=CANCEL).

If I rewrote INVITE/200/ACK into non-protracted transactions 
(say PROPOSE/200 and ACCEPT/200), I would need a new 
mechanism to cancel proposals.  Maybe I would use a new 
method (UNPROPOSE), or maybe I would just rePROPOSE.

So, I know that we can't and shouldn't use the existing 
CANCEL method for anything other than cancelling INVITE 
transactions, but SIP is extensible enough that we will be 
able cancel other things with new methods or mechanisms.

thanks,
-rohan

Christer,
By sending an error code for a CANCEL, does it mean that error-code
should be sent only if I (UA) do not want to process non-INVITE CANCEL?
If yes, then this could lead to backward compatibility problem -- i.e., an
UA running a new version of SIP sending a non-INVITE CANCEL to and
older version UA. For example:

UA new                            UA old
     -------- REFER ----------->
                                       start processing REFER
wait..wait
I want to cancel
REFER
  --------- CANCEL ---------->
                                       sorry I do not know why this cancel
                                       Discard and keep processing REFER
Whew...
I got REFER cancelled -------- REFER processing complete
                                          call transferred

In this case absence of an error-code signifies that CANCEL was
successful; whereas UA-old does not cancels REFER.

How do we handle such conditions?

I don't think we would change the requirement to still wait for a final
response to the request. The UA should not think the request is cancelled
unless it gets a 487 final response to the original request. This should not
change even if we allow responses other than 200-OK to a CANCEL. The
response to a CANCEL can tell you the CANCEL was rejected, it cannot tell
you it was successful. Only the 487 can tell you that. If you get a 200-OK,
or some other final response, the CANCEL did not work.

Remember, all transactions complete independently.

We must still get 487 final response to original request to know that the
request has truly been cancelled.

Robert:

Quick question - in section 3.6.2.2 you say --> Each NOTIFY MUST contain a
body of type "message/sipfrag".

My question if (ignoring the obvious security problems) a UA wants it may
copy the entire SIP message into the NOTIFY and use "message/sip", this
seems to be disallowed or am I reading it wrong?

For the usage of RPI will you be adding more into this document either by
way of requirements or examples, or simply referring back to the privacy
document?

Thanks,

Sriram

Chapter 11 contains all the SIP usage rules, and contains all
the MUST/SHOULD/MAY/whatevers.  There is nothing in there about
using reliable provisional response for the 180 Ringing.
You are right there is no reason why it needs to.

Chapter 12 is a set of examples; the example does use 100rel
for the 180.  So I think the current wording in section 12,
that "the 180-Ringing provisional response ... is also sent
using the reliability mechanism..." matches the figure and
intentionally contains no spec language.

On the forking section (13), I agree that there are other
alternatives to blindly doing multiple reservations when
multiple destinations respond with 18x responses.  I'll
expand that section to include the possibility of sequentially
handling the reservations, and also the possibility of sending
a BYE (with tags) to avoid the multiple reservations.

Subject: [Sip] More on manyfolks

Hi,

A couple of small comments/questions on the manyfolks draft:


Chapter 12.1.

The text says that the 180 Rining provisional response is also sent
using the reliability mechanism, ie PRACK. 

First, I would like to have it as a MUST/SHOULD/MAY/whatever - just to
clarify.

Second, it if is a MUST I would like to know why. I DO understand why
the 183 needs PRACK in this scenario, but why the 180?


Chapter 13.

First, since it has been decided that forking WILL be a part of the
spec, I think that the idea of having a chapter like this in the draft
is very good (more on that in another thread).

Anyway, since we now do support the sending of BYE for a specific call
leg, using the tag, before the call is established, I think it could be
added to this chapter. Ie would not be mandatory to do multiple resource
reservation.


Regards,

Christer Holmberg

This comment also applies to 100rel, since that is the source
of the text I lifted for manyfolks.

I'll fix the wording in manyfolks.  Is it still possible to fix
the 100rel draft?

I'd agree with Christer on this, and note that this problem stems from not
referencing the base spec for standard behaviour.

A common document would seem to make sense, if possible. I don't think it
should be part of the SDP revision: that ties SDP to one negotiation model,
which might not be appropriate for all scenarios.

I think we should leave it as sipfrag, even it it happens to be
a full message (any message/sip part qualifies as a message/sipfrag
part).

I'm just referencing the security framework since I expect we'll
be chewing on that for awhile.

Robert: 
Quick question - in section 3.6.2.2 you say --> Each NOTIFY MUST contain a
body of type "message/sipfrag". 
My question if (ignoring the obvious security problems) a UA wants it may
copy the entire SIP message into the NOTIFY and use "message/sip", this
seems to be disallowed or am I reading it wrong?
For the usage of RPI will you be adding more into this document either by
way of requirements or examples, or simply referring back to the privacy
document?
Thanks,

Since the phone system in NYC is severely overloaded, the Columbia
University administration is asking for help in setting up SIP or other
systems and identify gateways so that students and staff can call home.
Anybody who has gateways that they can make available for this, please
let me know. We have plenty of SIP phones around here; all I need is
config information.

While we're on the topic of generalisations...

I haven't been following the REFER header authentication debate, but
wouldn't a generic way to authenticate/sign any header be potentially useful
? (apologies if this is the current proposal anyway)

Perhaps a 'Previous-Header-authenticate:' header ?

Potentially we will have other headers in future where some entity needs to
vouch for their integrity.

Or a generic way to encrypt a single header. The 'Encrypted-header:' header.
Or do we already have that ?

Just a thought.

Hi,

The subscribe-notify draft RFC allows for alternate mechanisms to
"register" a subscription
at SIP nodes. I understand that an example of this is the REFER method,
where the
REFER effectively is used to create a subscription.

Are there other examples where this flexibility would be useful ?

Francois Lessing

Subject: [Simple] Questions on the current presence draft.



I was reading through the current draft, and noticed a few things that I 
was looking for clairification on. 

In the section on presence migration, the last sentence of the description 
for the second phase of presence migration states: "...This informs the
subscribers that their 
subscription was destroyed, and should be re-established with a new
SUBSCRIBE (with a new Call-ID)." 

I was wondering, if a watcher was offline when the NOTIFY containing the
"Subscription-Expires" header 
to destroy the current subscription, what are the implications with the call
id? I would imagine when the 
watcher comes back online, and tries to refresh the subscription, it would
use the old call-id (since it doesn't 
know that it needs to reselect), which gets proxied to the new PA (after the
migration occurred). This seems like a gap to me.

Also, what happens if the watchers (previous to the migration) never receive
the NOTIFY to update their 
subscriptions to cause a refresh. Unless they do a fetch, the new PA doesn't
know that they exist, so their 
subscriptions will be effectively moot, but they won't be aware of this
fact. They won't get any notifications, and 
won't know that their subscriptions are being ignored. 

In section 8, there are mixed uses of the presence URL and SIP URL's. Is
this done intentionally? 

Finally, can someone point a link to the draft listed as [4] in the
bibliography? It doesn't seem to be available 
at the IETF webpage. 

Thanks, 

Brian

Hello,
 
I have several questions relating to H.323
 
1) What's the fundamental difference between H.323 (including fast
setup) and SIP? I don't mean the text encoding or ANS.1 encoding. 
2) Could Media gateway controller use H.323 for session creation, and
use Megaco to communicate with media gateway?
3) Is any standard there to map H.323 with SIP?
 
Thanks, have a nice day
 
Lina

Hi All,

I have some questions regarding the draft
draft-bjorkner-serviceroute-00.txt.

I think it is a good thing to route requests according to the service a
user is subscribed for, but still I am confused in how the service-route
header is used.

1. "The service-route header should only be inserted in the first
request in a call leg." (4.1, page 4) Is it not possible that you first
contact the callee before deciding on which service to use?

2. "If a request contians both route headers and service-route headers
the route headers MUST be used for request routing." (4.1, page 5)
Indeed, if the route headers are used for request routing, it is not
useful to insert service-route headers in the subsequent requests.
However, I have the feeling that service-route headers can be useful in
subsequent requests. 

Comments?

Thanks,
Tim.

The service route is actually a loose route and the chain of service 
routes could
be considered as a chain of outbound proxies. We didn't like initial 
routing
and filtering services to be visited for a all following request, that 
is the reason
we stated a service-route SHOULD only be inserted in a initial request. 
If a
service needs to keep the call state, you should add a record-route, 
like you do
today.

Actually there is an error in the draft, the service route must also be 
added to
the CANCEL.

If a message contains both route-headers and service-route-headers, it is a
result of an error and the damage is minimized by just go for the route.

So the chain of service-route headers is actually a set of application
servers in the originating domain, each responsible for a different
server?

I think this should be repeated in section 4.2. As the text is stated
now, section 4.2 says to go for the service-route header, at least that
s how I interpreted it.

I'm sorry to be too rushed to personally thank each of your individually
right now, but thank you all for offering and helping us provide IP-based
telephone service at the drop of a hat so that our students and staff could
phone home and let their loved ones know they were OK. For your entertainment
follows a brief chronology that summarizes what transpired to get a handful
of IP phones up and running to bypass NYC Metro trunk congestion.

Wednesday 9/12/01 10:00pm              

Chronology of Columbia University's use of IP telephony and I2.  

All times US/Eastern (note how early some of the left-coasters log in
and read their mail!)

9/11 9:50am - roll in to work on the subway unaware of anything yet.
              Columbia is miles away from the World Trade Center.
    10:15am - find out what happened
            - start trying to phone home to reassure family and discover
              swamped phone circuits (no surprise here).  Send email to
              friends who live outside NYC asking them to phone my family
              (they do).
    10:30am - asked by administration if we can get some sort of Internet
              phone service set up in computer labs or similar public space
              for students to phone home.  Have a few staff try out net2phone
              but start thinking about how hard it will be to explain to
              people and ...
    10:57am - get bright idea: VoIP via remote campuses outside NYC metro
              area since our I2 and I1 links have stayed up.  Send email
              to Professor Henning Schulzrinne, "Mr. SIP" to ask if he
              can get some of his SIP phones working via remote partners.
              Prof. Schulzrinne and his students, Sankaran Narayanan,
	      and Kundan Singh <kns10@cs.columbia.edu> run with this while
              I pursue the non-SIP approach which I am more familiar with.
    11:22am - send similar email to videnet_all_admin@listserv.unc.edu since
              I have portable, user-friendly H.323 equipment.  Also sent
              email to NYSERNet 2000 Engineering Working Group with the
              same query plus asking about Cisco Call Manager (since
              we have some IP phones we were experimenting with).  Key to
              this is the remote site *must* have an outbound Internet to
              PSTN gateway.
    11:23am - Winner for the fastest response time: Mike Pihlman <mikep@es.net>
              at LBL in Berkeley offering his H.323 to H.320 gateway.
    11:36am - "James O. Whitlock" <whitlock@buffalo.edu> makes similar offer.
    11:36am - "Tim Poe" <timpoe@email.unc.edu> at University of North
              Carolina Chapel Hill sends IP address of his H.323
              gatekeeper and dialing string info.  This is the easiest
              for me so I go with it and start reconfiguring a Polycom
              Viewstation SP to use it.  Call my mom in Wilmington, NC
              and my wife in Westchester County, NY (not necessarily
              in that order:-).  Tell the administration we can
              provide an easy to use outbound phone setup.
    11:36am - Eric Damboise <damboise@maine.edu> offers use of Cisco Call
              Manager.
    11:56am - "Gabriel W. Moulton" <moulton.13@osu.edu> offers H.323 GW.
    12:06pm - Get bounced typo mail for NYNSERNet Engineering Working Group
              and this time actually send the message to them :-(
    12:18pm - "Jason Eells" <JasonE@cciu.org> also offers H.323 GW.
    meanwhile Henning's group and their SIP research partners at Nortel
              Networks, Jeremy George at Yale University, Clarent.com,
              Dynamicsoft.com, set up four SIP phones, each using a
              different gateway.
    12:37pm - "Greg Economides" <Greg@kamugate.tamu.edu> also offers H.323 GW.
    12:53pm - I am finally able to come up for air and reply to the email!
     1:00pm - Mike at ESNet has cascaded equipment with Arif Khan and Jamie
              Lambert at Ohio State.  He's also been getting a lot of vendor
              support from Accord.
     1:08pm - Radvision also offers their GW.
     1:16pm - Steve Blair at Univ of Pennsyvlania offers his Cisco MCM.
     1:21pm - Phil Coolick of Penn State University offers his Cisco MCM
              and we start setting up two Cisco IP phones to use his MCM.
     2:09pm - Dan Eckstrom and Dave Barr of Cornell offer to set up a Cisco
              MCM.
     2:21pm - 4 SIP IP phones are set up in the Computer Science conference
              room and made available to members of the department and
              shortly the entire Fu School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
     2:49pm - We get our IP phones working with Penn State's MCM.
     3:49pm - Steve Good of the Rochester Insitute of Technology worked with
              Cisco and Cornell to get Cornell some needed Call Director
              software.
     ~4pm   - We put two Cisco phones out in the lobby of our student
              center, next to public pay phones.  We chose to hold off on
              the more complicated to operate videoconference units.

As far as I know, all these phones are still available and we are still seeing
sporadic busy signals for some calls from our regular phone system.  I have
been out of the office since Tuesday volunteering doing Amateur Radio 
communications in support of the disaster recovery effort in NYC.

This is my first chance to log in and catch up on email.

Our thoughts are with those who have lost so much.

Yes, that's true. I think it is important to point at that the 
service-route
is not the ideal service compositioning mechanism, it is just one
possible tool.

This is also related to the currently very active loose-routing thread.
I belive adding complexity to the existing route header is worse than
adding complexity to the protocol with a new relative simple header.

Yes, it is somewhat unclear. Now it is described at the end of 4.1.

Hi,

Another question related to the manyfolks draft.

If we want to send a mid-call re-INVITE, for example to change codecs, I
assume that we will have to do the same procedure as in the beginning of
the call, with the 18x-, PRACK-, and COMET messages.

Now, since there is nothing wrong by sending 1xx provisional responses
for a mid-call request, isn't the 18x responses defined for the call
setup procedure? Also, I've never seen any example of the use of
mid-call PRACKs, even if I guess it's not illegal from a protocol point
of view either.

Comments on this?

I know. I do think, however, that the re-INVITE scenario should be
described in the draft. And, even if 1xx messages ARE allowed, it am not
sure it is a very good idea to send 180 Ringing in the middle of the
call. I guess 183 is ok, and maybe we could even define a new 18x code
for this purpose, if needed. 

My point is that until now I guess most people have assumed that 18x and
PRACK are used only during the call setup, no matter what the standard
may allow.

Regards,

Christer (lmfchh)

The sequence to change codecs mid-session would be identical to that
to establish a new session.  The new media streams could require
authorization, need resource reservations, etc, etc, etc.  The new
media stream could even require "ringing" if the end user needs to
do anything prior to the UAS accepting the codec change.  If any
of this fails, the mid-session codec change fails.

Nothing in the protocol prevents 1xx provisional responses to a mid-session
INVITE.  Nor does anything prevent a mid-session PRACK.

Actually, there isn't a single fundamental difference.  There are many
differences, and yet, both protocols objective at the highest level is the
same - call setup, management - teardown.  Perhaps you would like to refer
to a couple of the papers that are posted on the Columbia web-site.  There
have been several papers developed on the SIP-H.323 comparison.

To me, the fundamental difference is in the use of a single message (INVITE)
on the SIP side, compared to the multiple message traffic (e.g. ARQ, LRQ,
and so on) required to setup the calls.  There are many other differences as
well, so the challenge in mapping the two protocols is to determine from a
functional level the intent of the caller and map to the appropriate call or
sequence of calls on the other side.

>>2) Could Media gateway controller use H.323 for session creation, and
>>use Megaco to communicate with media gateway?

Well, I suppose anything is possible.  Why do you want to do it that way?

>>3) Is any standard there to map H.323 with SIP?

Check the internet drafts already available on this subject.

I know. I do think, however, that the re-INVITE scenario should be
described in the draft. And, even if 1xx messages ARE allowed, it am not
sure it is a very good idea to send 180 Ringing in the middle of the
call. I guess 183 is ok, and maybe we could even define a new 18x code
for this purpose, if needed. 

My point is that until now I guess most people have assumed that 18x and
PRACK are used only during the call setup, no matter what the standard
may allow.

Regards,

Christer (lmfchh)

Hi:

In scenarios 7.1 and 7.2 (Exposing Transfer Target and Protecting Transfer
Target: When the Transferee contacts the Transfer Target (or vice versa) the
contact has to be sent during session setup. So how are we actually
protecting the Transfer Target from the Transferee?

Thanks in advance,

Sriram

I think we should leave it as sipfrag, even it it happens to be
a full message (any message/sip part qualifies as a message/sipfrag
part).

I'm just referencing the security framework since I expect we'll
be chewing on that for awhile.

Robert: 
Quick question - in section 3.6.2.2 you say --> Each NOTIFY MUST contain a
body of type "message/sipfrag". 
My question if (ignoring the obvious security problems) a UA wants it may
copy the entire SIP message into the NOTIFY and use "message/sip", this
seems to be disallowed or am I reading it wrong?
For the usage of RPI will you be adding more into this document either by
way of requirements or examples, or simply referring back to the privacy
document?
Thanks,

Hi Lina, 

to your questions: 

1) The fundamental difference is in the model these two use - as you
probably know the SIP uses the Internet model - transaction oriented
(IETF) while H.323 uses "old-style" circtuit switched thinking (ITU-T). 

2) This is implementation specific. I can say that they are vendors
whose equipment can do exactly what you write (incl. the situation when
H.323 is replaced by SIP). 

3) There's no standard, but as far as I remember there is a draft
dealing with this: draft-agrawal-sip-h323-interworking-01.txt 

Kind regards

Hello,

I have several questions relating to H.323

1) What's the fundamental difference between H.323 (including fast
setup) and SIP? I don't mean the text encoding or ANS.1 encoding. 
2) Could Media gateway controller use H.323 for session creation, and
use Megaco to communicate with media gateway?
3) Is any standard there to map H.323 with SIP?

Thanks, have a nice day

Lina

The primary difference is whether or not you provide the transferee with
a URL that can be used to make the Transfer Target's phone ring at a 
later date. 
 
If the Transfer-Target is initiating a session, the SIP URL
that user agent provides in the contact _could_ be something only
valid for that session, or just something that it uses inside sessions
its agreed to participate in, but never accepts if it shows up in an
INVITE that is trying to establish a new session.
 
Of course, you're still ultimately supplying the IP address of the
transfer target, opening it up to all manner of other annoyances.
Real "protection" will involve something like an anonymizing sip and
media proxy.
 
The point to take away from the draft is that you can construct
a successful transfer by sending a REFER to either side, and
you should consider which way is appropriate for the environment.

Hi: 

In scenarios 7.1 and 7.2 (Exposing Transfer Target and Protecting Transfer
Target: When the Transferee contacts the Transfer Target (or vice versa) the
contact has to be sent during session setup. So how are we actually
protecting the Transfer Target from the Transferee?

Thanks in advance, 

Sriram

I think we should leave it as sipfrag, even it it happens to be 
a full message (any message/sip part qualifies as a message/sipfrag 
part). 

I'm just referencing the security framework since I expect we'll 
be chewing on that for awhile.

Robert: 
Quick question - in section 3.6.2.2 you say --> Each NOTIFY MUST contain a 
body of type "message/sipfrag". 
My question if (ignoring the obvious security problems) a UA wants it may 
copy the entire SIP message into the NOTIFY and use "message/sip", this 
seems to be disallowed or am I reading it wrong? 
For the usage of RPI will you be adding more into this document either by 
way of requirements or examples, or simply referring back to the privacy 
document? 
Thanks, 
Sriram

In order of easy to hard the answers are:

Question #3 - There are some drafts and a mailing list at
sip-h323@yahoogroups.com - At www.vovida.org there is a program that does
the simple cases of SIP to H323 interworking and is open source if you want
to look at how it works.

Question#2 - yes - and I imagine some will. It seem likely there will be
controllers that can talk SIP and H.323 and control a Megaco gateway.

Question #1 - ask 5 people, get 10 answers :-) Religion might be the most
consistent answer. This is hard to pin down (keep in mind you asked on a SIP
mailing list not a H.323 list so there may be some tiny bias in the answers
you get). For me, one of the key advantages of sip is that I think it will
be easier to create advanced services and features in it. There are many
other issues like scalability and building 99.999% available systems.

Hi Lina, 

to your questions: 

1) The fundamental difference is in the model these two use - as you
probably know the SIP uses the Internet model - transaction oriented
(IETF) while H.323 uses "old-style" circtuit switched thinking (ITU-T). 

2) This is implementation specific. I can say that they are vendors
whose equipment can do exactly what you write (incl. the situation when
H.323 is replaced by SIP). 

3) There's no standard, but as far as I remember there is a draft
dealing with this: draft-agrawal-sip-h323-interworking-01.txt 

Kind regards 

--Peter

1) What's the fundamental difference between H.323 (including fast
setup) and SIP? I don't mean the text encoding or ANS.1 encoding. 
2) Could Media gateway controller use H.323 for session creation, and
use Megaco to communicate with media gateway?
3) Is any standard there to map H.323 with SIP?

Thanks, have a nice day

Lina

Subject: [Sip] What is the mapping of ANI II digits to rpi-np?

Hi guys,

I have received several requests to allow bidirectional translation of
ANI II digits to its SIP equivalent in SIP INVITEs.  I see that in
draft-ietf-sip-privacy-02.txt, "Appendix A: Nature of Party" there is
rpi-np syntax that seems like it might address this mapping.

Although the complete bidirectional mapping is not obvious to me; I
could guess at a mapping.  However, for interoperability's sake, I think
it would be useful to have an explicitly defined bidirectional mapping.

So, I have 2 questions:
1) What is the proposed bidirectional mapping between ANI II digits and
rpi-np tokens.  (NOTE: The definition of ANI II digits can be found at:
http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/ani_ii_assignments.html).
2) Is rpi-np the standards track representation equivalent in SIP to ANI
II digits?

By the way, I think defining this mapping in a Best Current Practices
doc might be useful to other implementors as well.

many thanks for your help,
Bryan

Michael,

If the H.323 endpoint is unregistered or uses the direct call model and
pregranted ARQs, only a single message (Setup) is necessary in H.323 to
setup a call.

Actually, there isn't a single fundamental difference.  There are many
differences, and yet, both protocols objective at the highest level is the
same - call setup, management - teardown.  Perhaps you would like to refer
to a couple of the papers that are posted on the Columbia web-site.  There
have been several papers developed on the SIP-H.323 comparison.

To me, the fundamental difference is in the use of a single message (INVITE)
on the SIP side, compared to the multiple message traffic (e.g. ARQ, LRQ,
and so on) required to setup the calls.  There are many other differences as
well, so the challenge in mapping the two protocols is to determine from a
functional level the intent of the caller and map to the appropriate call or
sequence of calls on the other side.

>>2) Could Media gateway controller use H.323 for session creation, and

Well, I suppose anything is possible.  Why do you want to do it that way?

>>3) Is any standard there to map H.323 with SIP?

Check the internet drafts already available on this subject.

Peter,

H.323 does not use "old-style" circuit-switched thinking. This is SIP
propaganda.

Hi Lina,

to your questions:

1) The fundamental difference is in the model these two use - as you
probably know the SIP uses the Internet model - transaction oriented
(IETF) while H.323 uses "old-style" circtuit switched thinking (ITU-T).

2) This is implementation specific. I can say that they are vendors
whose equipment can do exactly what you write (incl. the situation when
H.323 is replaced by SIP).

3) There's no standard, but as far as I remember there is a draft
dealing with this: draft-agrawal-sip-h323-interworking-01.txt

Kind regards

--Peter

It's perfectly simple in concept that an MGC would speak H.323 on one 
interface and SIP on another. In fact some MGC's or Softswitches do this 
today. So if an MGC receives a call setup from an H.323 Gatekeeper which is 
intended for a SIP network, it would simply send a call setup to the SIP 
proxy that has reachability for the destination and upon receipt of an RTP 
address would instruct the H.323 Gatekeeper or gateway to open up an RTP 
connnection.

A similar action would take place if a call was destined for the PSTN and 
the MGC needed use SIP-T to contact another MGC to setup the call at the 
remote PSTN network. The far end MGC would speak MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 to 
control the trunking gateway to the PSTN.

Since such protocol interworking occurs internal to a given platform/MGC, 
there is no standard nor should there be. It is implementation specific as 
there is no interworking with other elements.

Hello,

	This is in reference to section 9 in the caller preferences draft.

	It says that - 'servers SHOULD reject requests with too many rules'.
What error code (4xx) must be used to reject incoming requests with too many
rules.

H.323 is part of the H.3xx suite and was developed to be compatible with
H.321, H.322, H324 - ISDN, ATM and POTS - all are circuit switched,
propaganda or not.

Its architecture has certainly started with ISDN multimedia.

Henry,

Hey, what is this, guilt by association? :-) Yes, _they_ are circuit
switched, but H.323 and SIP are 100% packet switched, so I don't understand
what your point is here. Moreover, both H.323 and SIP are based on
technology from the same era--right about 1990--including the WWW, HTML,
ISDN, and H.320, so they are equally "old style."

BTW, I apologize for the "propaganda" remark. Those three cups of coffee
this morning kinda jazzed me up a bit. 8-}

Jim,

Thanks for your comments on the manyfolks draft.  I'll try
to address each of them individually.

whoops.  fixed.

> Table 4 Summary of header fields, P-Z, not in alphabetical order ;-)

That's what I get for picking it up from another draft, without looking
closely.  fixed.

> Section 16 is vague to the point of uselessness as no IPR statements on the
> IETF page refer directly to this draft.

3Com's statement is there; AT&T's statement is on its way.  The text for
section 16 came straight from RFC2026.  Though I agree with the comment,
it is required to be there, exactly as is.

The intention is that this draft be an extension of RFC2543, and not bis.
Therefore, several sections of bis are repeated (but just those portions 
that are needed for this mechanism).  The hope is that nothing will
directly conflict with bis, when it becomes an RFC.  I believe that
is true except for the prohibited use of Record-Route from the provisional
response (noted below, and which will be fixed).

The draft defines an option value for the Requires header (section 10).
Agreed it is not possible to be QoS Assured and backwards compatible.
The tag is optional to quickly recover from a UAS that does not support
preconditions (by letting the session proceed without them).  If that is
not the desired recovery, then the option tag would be used in the request.

I've added text to section 10 to make this point clearer.

agreed

It is intended that this draft make this a MUST, while the base spec is
only a SHOULD.  The Route header is needed for the COMET (just as for
the PRACK).  I believe this is valid for the manyfolks extension to
strengthen the requirement language of the base spec.  

Inclusion of the Route header in the COMET is more of a problem.  The
current text says it MUST be placed in the COMET, and MUST NOT be placed 
in any other request.  I'm removing the MUST NOT line to not conflict with 
bis.  However, it is true that this "MUST be placed in the COMET" directly 
conflicts with the "MUST NOT be placed in any other request" in 100rel,
and therefore should be taken to override 100rel as well.

Agreed.  It is better to just reference the base spec there.

> Section 6.1

> 
> Content-Length should be "m*"

2543 didn't define "m*" for this table, and has Content-Length marked
as optional.  I'd agree that based on bis it should be "m*", but based
on 2543 it should be kept as "o".

since manyfolks is an extension to 2543, these headers are not yet
defined.  Again I'd agree that based on bis they should be in the table,
but based on 2543 they should not be.

The section numbers match 2543.

but not in 2543 and needed for this feature.  Therefore duplicated
here.  Hopefully this will not conflict with the final text in bis.

Other changes to appear in next version of manyfolks draft, based on
other list comments:

Added text in section 11 (usage rules) making explicit that a
mid-session re-INVITE follows the same sequence of messages as
an initial INVITE.

Tried to add text to section 13 about doing resource reservations
sequentially, instead of in parallel, but discovered many problems
interacting with the forking proxy that limit the information available
to the UAC in those cases.  So this was left unchanged.

I will make the MSWord source of the draft, with changebars, available
if anyone is interested in mid-versions.

The remark "old-style" circuit-switched thinking" is generic I believe,
since there is more to a protocol suite than just circuits or packets.
It is about what the thinking was behind the design.

It has to do with the standards process, architectural philosophy and
"details", such as ASN.1 versus text encoding, etc. Instead of repeating
old discussions, would suggest to go to several web sites that deal with
this subject, such as:

http://www.iptel.org/info/trends/sip.html

There are other web sites, probably also some of which take a more
favorable view of H.323.

I hope this answers the meaning :-)  of "thinking" in the above remark.

Yes, it is possible to fix the 100rel draft. It's technically at the IESG
after having received all corrections indicated by original IESG review. I
don't thnk they notice if we changed this fairly minor point and
resubmitted.

Getting time out of the author to make the change, however, could be
difficult.

if a proxy receives two messages of INVITE with the same call leg, but with different branch which is behavior?
the proxy is able to distinguish the branchs generated from an other proxy?

Dear colleagues,

since I have started this discussion about the SIP vs. H.323, please let 
me very briefly explain my motivation.
Firstly, my intention was not to offend anybody here. I just wanted to 
express purely technical/protocol design background.
The truth really is, that H.323 has strong telephony/ISDN roots. However 
the truth also is that H.323 has still several advantages over SIP.
I don't want to extend my explanation on, which features I mean here, as 
this is the SIP mailing list (you can e-mail me on my address directly if 
needed).
Please, if anybody feels hit at the heart, I appologize, perhaps I should 
be more carefull with the wording.

Kind regards

D.I. Peter Gajdos

&gt; thinking (ITU-T). <br>
I wonder if this sort of comment is really necessary.<br>
&gt; 2) This is implementation specific. I can say that they are vendors<br>
&gt; whose equipment can do exactly what you write (incl. the <br>
&gt; situation when<br>
&gt; H.323 is replaced by SIP). <br>
In my opinion, the two protocols will coexists in the foreseeable future.<br>
More than that, I cannot say.<br>
<br>
&gt;3) There's no standard, but as far as I remember there is a draft<br>
&gt; dealing with this: draft-agrawal-sip-h323-interworking-01.txt <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Kind regards <br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hello,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have several questions relating to H.323<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1) What's the fundamental difference between H.323 (including fast<br>
&gt; setup) and SIP? I don't mean the text encoding or ANS.1 encoding. <br>
&gt; 2) Could Media gateway controller use H.323 for session creation, and<br>
&gt; use Megaco to communicate with media gateway?<br>
&gt; 3) Is any standard there to map H.323 with SIP?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks, have a nice day<br>
&gt; <br>

Hi,

I have some, mainly editorial, comments about the draft
draft-khartabil-sip-conferencing-00.txt. 

5.1 (page 5) "The 200 response will contain a list of current
participants, ..." 
I think emphasising that this is the 200 OK response for the REGISTER
request will make this more clear. (I first interpreted it as a 200 for
the SUBSCRIBE request, but did not understand, because the CPS has to
send a NOTIFY with exactly this information.)

5.5.1 (page 6) NOTIFY message example
The contact header contains the conference ID. Is this correct? I though
to have understood that the contact headers should be a list of
participants of the conference.

5.2 & 5.3 (pages 6 and 7)
the accronyms cps., imcs. and imcps. are mixed. Is this intentionally or
do they all signify the same type of server? If intentionally, I think
it would be opportune to clarify which specific feature on an IMCPS is
used. If the same type of server is meant, I suggest to use only cps. to
avoid confusion.

Regards,
Tim.

Dean,

We'd notice :)

It is fine to submit a fix to an error in a new 100rel draft.

Michael,

No, the pregranted ARQ is part of the registration process and is not
involved with call setup. Let me say it again, call setup can be
accomplished with a single message, so H.323 is no different than SIP in
this regard.

Also, H.323 and SIP have influenced each other, so it's not by any means a
one-way street.

Hello,

> streams for the whole sessions. However, I see no reason why it
> shouldn't be possible to update the draft (I guess Gonzalo is the man to
> make that decission)

My first idea related to FID was to use it exactly for this purpose:
"SDP media alignment". However, the optimization I was thinking of at
that point of time was a different one. If a UAC sends an INVITE with
two m lines and the UAS wants to establish a session with 3 m lines the
server needs to accept the session and later re-INVITE. With an m line
identifier it is possible to add new streams in the 200 OK and then get
the final SDP in the ACK.

This would have been a big gain (3 messages instead of 6), but it
requires a 3-way handshake. SIP just provides a 2-way handshake
(regarding SDP exchange). Using a 3-way handshake would make 3pcc
impossible. That's why we abandoned that original idea.


Now, coming back to our current problem, using identifiers just to reuse
m lines is overkill. We just need to allow that the position of an m
lines that has been answered with port zero can be reused. Adding stream
identifiers does not give us any extra gain.

Therefore, let us focus in our real problem. The decision we have to
make is: can a UA reuse a position in the SDP when that media stream has
been rejected?

My personal opinion is: if any implementor has a problem with this,
let's keep the mechanism as it is right now (that is, we dissallow
position reuse). If implementors feel that this change will not break
significally their code, let's go for it.

Regards,

Gonzalo

It looks like the info from the draft for locating a SIP Server (referenced
by [36]) has been pulled back into Section 1.4.2. But section 16.5 still
references [36].

What is the planned future of this text, to keep it in the bis04 or to
update the draft? 

The 4th paragraph in section 1.4.2 (and is in the draft as well) mentions
that clients must re-run "the above mentioned algorithm" but I fail to find
the above mentioned algorithm in either texts. I remember reading one before
(prehaps in an older draft) but fail to find it.

We will update bis.  There will be a section of bis that is Locating a SIP
Server.
 
This gives me the opportunity to tell you what is happening with bis.
As many of you know, the words in the protocol document have
become twisted, mostly because the protocol has evolved and the words
have also evolved, and you don't get good readable text from many
sequential edits.
 
As a result, we have decided to COMPLETELY REWRITE the document.
We have recruited a team of people.  We have agreed on an outline.
We have parceled out the sections to team members, and they are now
busily rewriting the text.  Of course, they are using the current text
as the arbiter of what the protocol is; our aim is to make sure that all the

MUSTS and SHOULDS and MAYS show up the way the current words
describe it, but, hopefully much clearer language.
 
When chapters are completed, we will have several reviews to try
to catch any violations of the above.  We will then put out drafts of
the new text for you all to find the goofs we missed.   The team members
have committed very substantial portions of their time to get this task
done as quickly as possible. 
 
This means that there will not be an -05 for a while.  We encourage you
to continue to report problems with -04.  We have processes in place to 
make sure that we don't miss any problems reported while we are rewriting.
The date we are STILL driving for is WGLC on Dec 1.

Subject: [Sip] Locating a SIP Server - bis04 confusion



It looks like the info from the draft for locating a SIP Server (referenced
by [36]) has been pulled back into Section 1.4.2. But section 16.5 still
references [36].

What is the planned future of this text, to keep it in the bis04 or to
update the draft? 

The 4th paragraph in section 1.4.2 (and is in the draft as well) mentions
that clients must re-run "the above mentioned algorithm" but I fail to find
the above mentioned algorithm in either texts. I remember reading one before
(prehaps in an older draft) but fail to find it.

  I would suggest interested guys look at unbiased

  http://www.stanford.edu/~chuhee/project/voip/comparison.htm

  As long as there are two, people will never agree

Unfortunately, a fair amount of what's said in that paper about SIP is
plain factually wrong. Readers beware.

   It would be nice if you point specific things misleading

   I mentioned the previous paper, because below

I guess that sounds ok. However, considering the manyfolks mechanism
(using 18x and PRACK for the negotiation), in that case we would going
towards two different methods of doing 3-way handshake...

I think the problem is, that so far we have been talking pretty much
about codecs ("I tell you what codecs I support in the INVITE, and you
tell me what codecs you support in the 200..." - period. ), and not
multiple streams. 

So, one question is: if A initiates the session, giving one or more
streams, should B be allowed to add more streams in the session
establishment? One could say no, and that B must send a re-INVITE after
the 200/ACK if it wants to add more streams.

I agree that this was the initial problem, but I think they are related
to each other. If we DO have a mechanism to identify the streams per
session, it is then easier to come up with mechanisms/rules how to
re-use them - AND how to add/remove streams during the call WITHOUT
having to re-send the whole SDP in the re-INVITE.

We should also remember that "setting the port to zero" is very IP
specific (similar to the media on-hold issue), so  it won't work very
good with ATM.

This thread is telling me that as well as CANCEL being an open issue for the
bis draft, it is also an open issue for the refer draft.

REFER certainly seems to be defined in an open ended fashion at the moment.

3.6.1 specifies the following:

A UA receiving a well-formed REFER request SHOULD request approval
   from the user to proceed (this request could be interactive or
   through configuration).  Upon receiving approval from the user, the
   UA MUST contact the resource identified by the URL in the Refer-To:
   header.  Note that if the URL is a SIP URL, it could contain header
   fields such as Call-Id that may be used to form the resulting
   request.  If the URL is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the
   REFER request should be copied into the request sent to the referred-
   to resource.

If this requires human interaction, then I would expect any duration to
exist from about 5s through to 180s. 

During this time, there seems to be no provision for the sender to be sent
anything (no mention of provisional responses for REFER - do they exist?). 

The current text seems to indicate that CANCEL should be used from the
sending end if an included Expires header is exceeded. 

I could find no text that extends the procedures that extend the Expires
header to methods other than INVITE or REGISTER although the tables in the
refer draft indicate that it is optional for REFER requests.

I could find no text that specifies what either the sender or receiver think
if the Expires header is not included. Do they wait for ever?

I'm sure I have missed some things here in looking for procedures. Would
anybody like to give a summary of how the sender and receiver react to
absence of response for the REFER method. I am convinced that either the bis
draft or the refer draft needs to tell more of the story.

Hi Keith,
     The "hidden secret" lies in section 18.2 which clarifies :

"...The Authorization header field is used in requests to authenticate
the request originator end-to-end to proxies and the called user agent,
and in responses to authenticate the called user agent or proxies returning
their own failure codes."


Regards,
Subhash.

In table 4, the Authorization header carries rows that apply to it being a
request header and a response header.

In table 3 it is defined only as a request header, and in the
authentication
procedures later in the document and in the references it only seems to
appear in requests.

Is it truly only a request header and table 4 is wrong, or is there some
hidden secret somewhere.

I was checking the inclusion of the Priority header in the various methods,
and coming up with strange and inconstent answers.

The bis draft says it is optional to include only in the INVITE request.
The manyfolks draft says it is optional to include in the COMET request.
RFC 2976 says it is optional to include in the INFO request.
The refer draft says that it is not included in a REFER request.

I assume that there is some ISUP mapping reason why it is included in an
INFO, presumably because the information came later than when the INVITE was
sent - is this true? If untrue, then it should not be in INFO.

I cannot understand why it is included in a COMET request - is this an error
in manyfolks?

I would have thought that it could have been useful in REFER. Any views?

Keith -

The text below doesn't imply the UA should wait for the
human loop to close before replying to the REFER request.
The REFER transaction itself must complete almost immediately,
hence the change several months ago to the 202 response 
followed by a subsequent notify letting the REFERer know what
the result of the REFERed action (which, if a UA doesn't have
a user's policy coded into it, could be a 603 declined because
the user said no).

Its an understandable misread though - the way you interpreted
it was in fact the original intent _way_ back when before we
spotted that we had to complete the transaction in non-INVITE
time.

I'll see if I can make the text less likely to mislead someone
in the future. On a first pass, changing the first occurance of
"recieving" to "accepting" may be sufficient.

No, we are not. 18x and PRACK is still an offer/answer model.

This is exactly what I have explained in my previous mail. Since we use
an offer/answer model, the callee needs to re-INVITE in order to add
more streams. This was discussed a lot of IETFs ago in the MMUSIC
session.

Sending the whole SDP in the INVITE is NOT a disadvantage. It is a
desing rule that SIP developers MUST follow. It avoids synchronization
problems and allows easier failure recovery.

And as I said before, it is not necessary to have identifiers in order
to reuse stream positions.

Gonzalo

There are a few things that are wrong about H.323, too. I'll follow up

Hi All:

   Is there any effort for SIP to interoperate or replace IETF message / 
mail RFCs: SMTP (RFC822), IMAP4 (RFC2060) or VPIM(RFC2421) besides "SIP 
Event Package for Message Waiting Indication"?

   Charles

So, given this (for the refer draft) - 

A 202 response to REFER says "I know about refer and know how to handle one,
but I do not yet know whether I will issue an INVITE or not." Perhaps we can
get the sense of the above into the first paragraph of section 3.5.
Alternatively, as we do define a new status-code, maybe the refer draft
should contain a section equivalent to 11.2.1 in the bis draft defining this
new status-code, and it could be included there.

The original sender of the REFER then relies on receipt of the NOTIFY to
know if the request has been actioned or not.

Editorial note: I have failed to understand the distinction between the
material in section 3.5 and section 3.6. Section 3.6 is UA procedures, and
3.5 just seems to be more of them.

Further question: Given that responses should be nearly immediate, why do we
need an Expires header in REFER (see section 3.3). (Expires is currently
only defined for INVITE and REGISTER).

Editorial note: Can we have a table number for this table in section 3.3.

Perhaps we also need to say that REFER does not allow provisional responses.

Further question: Does the 202 status-code, although defined in the refer
draft, apply to other methods other than REFER, or in your view does it only
apply to REFER.

We can do this (but see below)

This is done in sip-events

_IF_ the UA has enough information to know it won't try the
referred action (for instance, the REFER might be to an rtsp:
URL and the UA doesn't support rtsp:, or it could be to a
SIP INVITE URL which is blacklisted at the phone), it can 
return a non-200 to the REFER request itself.

Good observation. 3.5 has evolved to be only behavior, so I'll
move it to the first section of 3.6.

It's also defined for SUBSCRIBE, but I don't think we want
to inherit that meaning here. I'll edit the 3.3 table accordingly.

Done.

The REFER spec doesn't need to say anything about this -
REFER needs to behave like any other non-INVITE transaction
where this is concerned. The normative text will be in the
core specification.

Note that even though non-INVITEs should be completing quickly,
allowing 100 is still important for UDP to quench retransmits
for latent links.

As mentioned before, this is in sip-events.

Hi,

In Section 8.1 of the SIP-ISUP-03 draft, the call flows for SUS and RES

I recall that there were some discussion on whether to use INFO instead.
Does the current version (03) reflect the latest agreement on this?

Thanks,
YoungSun

Subject: [Sip] Question about the cc-transfer draft - usage of callId.
Sender: sip-admin@ietf.org
Errors-To: sip-admin@ietf.org

Precedence: bulk

Hello,

            I have a question regarding the usage of call-id's during call
transfer. In example 7.2 the following steps are taken -

            a) A call is established between the transferor and the
transferee - clid 1.
            b) A call is established between the transferor and the
transfer-target - clid 2.
            c) A REFER message is sent to the transfer-target. - clid 2.
--->       d) The transfer-target issues an INVITE to the transferee with
clid 2.

            - Shouldnt the transfer-target use clid 3 when it tries to
establish a call with the transferee? 
            - Is this a mistake in the figure? If this allowed then a call
is established between two parties with the same call-id.

            A similar scenario is present in section 7.3.

Regards,

Chinmay

I know of no reason to include a Priority header in a COMET.  A cut/paste
error.  I'll remove that entry in the next manyfolks update.

Subject: [Sip] Priority header

I was checking the inclusion of the Priority header in the various methods,
and coming up with strange and inconstent answers.

The bis draft says it is optional to include only in the INVITE request.
The manyfolks draft says it is optional to include in the COMET request.
RFC 2976 says it is optional to include in the INFO request.
The refer draft says that it is not included in a REFER request.

I assume that there is some ISUP mapping reason why it is included in an
INFO, presumably because the information came later than when the INVITE was
sent - is this true? If untrue, then it should not be in INFO.

I cannot understand why it is included in a COMET request - is this an error
in manyfolks?

I would have thought that it could have been useful in REFER. Any views?

Hi,

First, I would like to go back a few mails, to the original issue, so
let's forget all FIDs, stream IDs etc for a couple of seconds.

Assume that A sends the following:

m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2 3
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2 3 4

Now, B wants to use different ports for different codecs, but B doesn't
support any related SIP extensions (FID, for example), so the reply may
look something like:

m=audio 300 RTP/AVP 1
m=audio 400 RTP/AVP 2
m=audio 500 RTP/AVP 3

Now, there is NO way for A to know which m= line (except, in this case,
the first) in the response maps to which m= line in the request, so I
don't agree with what Jonathan said in the initial mail ("This works
because there is never any confusion about which streams correspond to
which.") 

So, before we even come to the issue of REPLACING/REUSING streams we see
that this does NOT work. So, the question is: shall bis forbid this kind
of behaviour, and state that there MUST be a 1:1 mapping between the m=
lines in the request and response, and separate ports within a single
logical stream can NOT be used? And, is this really a backward
compability issue, since it doesn't work anyway? Or, have I missed
something? 

Then, IF someone wants to "split" an m= line into multiple m=lines
(still defining a single logical stream), using separate ports etc some
SIP extension MUST be used.



Then, assuming that this extension would be the FID draft (let us still
forget about all other stream IDs etc which have been proposed), I think
there would need to be an option-tag, to be used in the Supported- or
Require header, to inform the UAS that the feature is supported. The FID
draft currently DOES say (chapter 6.4) that the grouping must be
requested by the UAC. But, how does that work in the example above?

a=group:FID ?
a=group:FID ?
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2 3
a=mid: ?
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2 3 4
a=mid: ?

Should we allow something like:

a=group:FID a b c
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2 3
a=mid: a b c
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2 3 4
a=mid: d e f

Also, if A now wants to remove one codec from one group, the re-INVITE
could look like:

a=group:FID a b
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2
a=mid: a b
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2 3 4
a=mid: c d e

Now, where did stream 3 (a=mid: c) go? It is still supposed to be in the
SDP, so I guess the re-INVITE MUST look like:

a=group:FID a b c
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2
a=mid: a b
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 3  (NOTE: Port set to zero, since A wants to remove
this codec from the stream!)
a=mid: c
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2 3 4
a=mid: d e f

Anyway, since the FID draft does not allow multiple identification-tags
in a single mid, this doesn't work.


A possible solution would be to make it MANDATORY for the UAC to only
include ONE codec per m= line from the beginning, EVEN if the same port
is used for each of them:

a=group:FID a b c
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1
a=mid: a
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 2
a=mid: b
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: c
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2
a=mid: d
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: e
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 4
a=mid: f

Now, it would also be no problem to issue the re-INVITE:

a=group:FID a b c
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1
a=mid: a
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 2
a=mid: b
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 3 (NOTE: Port set to zero!)
a=mid: c
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2
a=mid: d
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: e
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 4
a=mid: f


Now, one could think that this is fine and works, but it actually brings
us to my next question :)

Chapter 6.2. in the FID draft says that the mid value in a response MUST
be the same as the mid value in the request. So, let's take the example
above again.

A sends:

a=group:FID a b c
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1
a=mid: a
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 2
a=mid: b
m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: c
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 2
a=mid: d
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: e
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 4
a=mid: f

Now, B only supports ONE codec per stream, ie it will only send 2 m=
lines back, so how can it do a 1:1 mid mapping???

a=group:FID ?
a=group:FID ?
m=audio 300 RTP/AVP 1
a=mid: ?
m=audio 400 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: ?

Or, B could reply with:

a=group:FID a b c
a=group:FID d e f
m=audio 300 RTP/AVP 1
a=mid: a
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 2 (NOTE: Port set to zero!)
a=mid: b
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 3 (NOTE: Port set to zero!)
a=mid: c
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 2 (NOTE: Port set to zero!)
a=mid: ?
m=audio 400 RTP/AVP 3
a=mid: ?
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 4 (NOTE: Port set to zero!)
a=mid: ?

However, I am not sure this is a good solution, to put ports to zero
only to indicate that the UAS don't support the same codecs as the
UAC...

Comments?

No. In fact, I don't believe there's even any real overlap with VPIM.

So, if this is the case, it cannot be a request header, as currently defined
in table 3 of the bis draft, but must be a general header. 

So,  which is right, and can I understand that from the current bis draft,
or does it require some modification.

Subject: Re: [Sip] SIP Negotiate


RE: [Sipping] SIP Negotiate
I agree that there is a need for this kind of functionality. However,
when you say in the beginning "Examples of parameters that
... include ... message integrity mechanisms, encryption
algorithms, etc.", I'd like to note that this what we need in
terms of security parameters is a _secure_ negotiation of them.
As you say yourself in section 10.1 of
http://www.obsidian97.com/draft-spbs-sip-negotiate-00.txt :

> One of the intended uses for the negotiation mechanism is to set
> up authentication and message integrity algorithms. Thus the 
> NEGOTIATE method itself is not subject to these protections - this
> makes the recipient vulnerable to the Man-in-the-middle attacks. 
> Views are solicited to mitigate this security consideration.

This is a crucial point to handle correctly. Otherwise the peers
may be fooled onto using insecure algorithms or perhaps even
no algorithms at all. It is also interesting to note that the answer
can't really be "integrity protect the NEGOTIATE" because
that would mean an integrity protection algorithm would have
to be applied before one is selected!

[Sriram] One way around this is to ensure that the UA is authenticated
post NEGOTIATE - the authentication algorithm being one of the items
being negotiated. This would diminish the chances of a MITM attack.
Also the message post negotiate may be integrity protected which
is further strengthens security. This of course would require
keys to be sent back in the response to the NEGOTIATE. The
combination of authentication and message integrity would be
good solution to MITM attacks.

We've done some work on this issue earlier in the context of
SIP usage in 3G networks, and came up with some requirements.
These included the following:

* MUST be able to choose different integrity algorithms,
  MAY be able to choose other security parameters,
  encryption algorithms, and security protocols.
[Sriram] Met by NEGOTIATE
* It MUST be possible to protect the parameter negotiation
  against attackers who do not have the secret authentication
  keys (and can't forge hashes in real-time).
* MUST not add new roundtrips (i.e. done in parallel with
  other setup such as registration or authentication). In particular,
  it would not be nice if we had separate negotiation phases for security,
  compression, sip itself, and only then we'd be able to do
  something.
[Sriram] NEGOTIATE does add one more roundtrip however so does sending
in a REGISTER and having a 401 challenge. The advantage of NEGOTIATE
is that several different meta-session parameters can be negotiated
at the same time.

Traditionally, security protocols have solved secure negotiation
of parameters by hashing/signing the offers with authentication
keys or keys derived from authentication. For instance, IKE
negotiates parameters in cleartext but in a later phase a keyed
hash is taken from the original parameter offers and responses,
and sent to the other side as a proof that nothing was changed in
the packet's path.

Something similar needs to happen here as well. We've had
the idea that once integrity protection can be turned on, you'll
repeat the offers under it, and only after this you can start to
trust and use what was negotiated. (Integrity protection can be
turned on basically after something has given you keys
and you have agreed on the selected algorithm.)

No real reason for the trigerred invite to have call-id of 2 in those

Hi,

There has been a number of SIP bakeoff events to
test the interoperability of vendor X SIP implementation
with that of vendor Y.

Has a SIP Test Specifications been considered besides
the SIP interops?

Thanks,

First of all, this reply indicates three streams are supported by the
sender.

A does know by matching m= lines as specified in rfc2543 (and bis), B has
added a third stream.  B has also indicated that it only supports codec 1 in
the first stream and only supports codec 2 in the second stream.  The two
endpoints can exchange media successfully provided A complies with B's
capabilities.  B's added third stream is of no use since A only specified
its support for two streams in this session.

My read of Jonathon's statement you reference was dealing with session
descriptions with matching number of m= lines and how re-use of a disabled
stream should be "understood".

It does work IMHO (maybe not as you intended). With current offer-answer
model only a 1:1 mapping makes sense.  Current SDP "disallows" separate
ports within a single stream.  (As I myself have said on another list, my
vocoders can't handle different media encodings on the same port.  So I
would respond as you indicated above, only two media streams though.)

Correct, it's not supported today that I know of.

On the original issue, reusing disabled streams (m= lines), It won't bother
me one way or another.

Others will have to respond to the rest of this message as I don't
understand the correct use of the FID myself :)

Bert

Just to be clear, its a stronger statement than that. That call-id can't be
2. Thats because call-ids for new calls are globally unqiue.

No, it is not the case. Usage of authorization for authenticating responses
has been deprecated, and this has not been well pruned from the spec. It was
never well specified and rfc2617 anyway defines a different mechanism using
authorization info, which we will use instead.

This thread has again been sidetracked, and I'd like to bring it back. 

I think there is agreement that if the server can't or won't process a
CANCEL, it simply sends some response to the CANCEL (it really doesn't
matter whether its a 405, 400 or 200 OK), and continues processing the
request as if nothing happened. That is always an option, and even though
not explicitly stated, has always been possible.

The main source of contention, I think, is whether we think there might be
future methods that can make use of a CANCEL for non-invite. I agree here
with Rohan that since all future methods are non-INVITE, and since
non-INVITE have to complete immediately, they really can't be useful for
future requests.

No code is defined. This is meant to prevent attacks, so there is little
point to explicitly telling the attacker to try again with fewer rules. Just
rejecting it suffices to prevent the attack.

Priority is one of these mostly harmless headers. If it doesn't make sense
in a method, its inclusion doesn't hurt anything.

INFO could potentially be used for things beyond ISUP mapping, and there
very well could be some reason why the INFO request needs to be processed
with high priority.

As something like "this is a really important call transfer" ? I guess it
can't hurt.

On a related note, I think that this text is wrong regarding increasing
duration	. The bit about not making the subscription duration longer
is legacy from the days when registration durations could not be made
longer. But, for reasons of protecting against overload, we now allow a
registrar to increase the duration. I think the same should go for
subscribe.

Correct, it doesn't need to be. There is no fundamental reason. UDP is the
harder problem, and thats what the draft tackles. Nothing prevents TCP from
working, I just didn't get to it in the first draft (and many other issues
too).

Funny you should mention it, since I think this one should be removed :) We
now have applications for sip, like IM and presence, where there may not be
any calls. There is really no reason for them to have to implement INVITE in
that case (their UA would simply 405 the INVITE).

I think thats a good idea. I'll make sure its done as part of the rewrite.

Just to be clear, you are saying that it is ok for a UA to respond to a
re-invite w/o SDP with an offer that is the same as the previous sdp in all
ways, except a change in ip address and port?

Why is that needed?

But the re-invite is not a hold - its an empty invite with no sdp.

I don't see how thats relevant to this bit here. Can you explain?

Thats not the purpose of invite w/o sdp.

Well, its kind of just punting the problem. If we have something in there
about this at all, we should describe how it can be made to work in a
sensible way.

This is done already. Section 5 of draft-ietf-sip-guidelines mentions
interactions with existing features, and forking is listed.

Egads! Please don't do things like that.

The lifetime of an early call leg is bounded by the lifetime of the invite
transaction. If an invite transaction ends in a non-2xx, all early call legs
with different tags have been terminated. If an invite transaction ends in a
2xx, existing early call legs have either been terminated, or a 2xx will
arrive within short order (assuming forking proxies cancel after 2xx, which
I have proposed is at least a SHOULD, if not a MUST; otherwise, the uac has
to cancel after the first 2xx to stop other branches). Thus, a short timer,
like 16s, will suffice. After that, any non-2xx'd early call legs are done.

This is worth adding to bis to describe.

I disagree with it, since it is a fundamental change to the proxy
transaction model. It will break backwards compatibility. That is really not
needed, since the problems it is trying to address can be solved as
discussed above in a backwards compatible way.

Let me elaborate some more.

Here's the problem. Currently, bis-04 says that when a proxy forks, it
SHOULD generate a CANCEL to uncompleted branches when it receives a 2xx.
Because its a SHOULD, its possible that a proxy doesn't do it. So, consider
a UAC that sends an INVITE. It doesn't know whether the INVITE forked
downstream. So, when the UAC gets a 2xx, it has no way to know whether or
not to expect further 2xx anytime soon. Thats because it doesn't know
whether the potentially forking proxy downstream actually cancelled. So, the
UAC will need to generate a CANCEL on receipt of a 2xx. This would need to
happen for every INVITE. Bad, IMHO. THis is why I proposed making it a MUST.
That is, a forking proxy MUST send a cancel on receipt of a 2xx/6xx. This
way, the UAC doesn't need to send a CANCEL. After the first 2xx, it will
receive subsequent 2xx almost immediately (within the bounds of
retransmissions for packet loss recovery), or never.

If a proxy forks, it has to take responsibility for cleaning that up. I
believe Bob Penfield had objected to this, since he had a particular app
that took advantage of downstream proxies NOT cancelling. My argument was
that he couldn't count on the proxies not cancelling, so he'd have to use
caller preferences at the application server to request that the downstream
proxies not cancel. 

So, the concrete proposal is that normal behavior is that a proxy MUST
cancel any outstanding branches on 2xx/6xx, but caller prefs can modify
that. This way, the UAC would have to send cancel only if it asked the
downstream proxies not to do it.

Unless I hear otherwise in TWO WEEKS, this will be the final decision.

THis is the open issue that won't go away. There always seem to be threads
on it, with continuous dissenters.

Lets finish this. 

My proposal remains as above. If you want to hang up a call before a final
response, you send CANCEL. Any 2xx this may trigger are responded to with
BYE. Early call legs can be hung up with tagged BYE, which is better than
putting tags in CANCEL to hang up early call legs.

Please weigh in for this in either direction.

It is to me as well. I think sip multicast is really quite broken; this is
just one example of the problem. Another, for example, is this. A proxy
sends a multicast INVITE. It gets a single 5xx response. It has no way of
knowing whether any furhter responses (such as a 2xx) will arrive. If can't
send the 5xx, since a 2xx might show up, proxy rules prohibit a proxy from
sending a 2xx after a 5xx. THus, it can't send the 5xx upstream until the
transaction times out. THis means that all multicast transactions take the
full 16s (or whatever it is)to complete for non-2xx responses. Thats bad.

The main motivation we had for multicast sip was register, but I think the
dhcp draft is a far better way to bootstrap to your registrar. Plus, there
were issues (its actually another open issue) of transitioning from a
multicast registration to unicast once you've discovered your registrar.
That problem would go away too.

Another motivation was call center types of applications, where you reach
the first user at a given address. Realistically, you don't need (and don't
want in all likelihood) multicast for this. 

So, in the interests of greater simplicity, and following the philosophy
that the protocol is done NOT when you have no more to add, but no more to
take away, I'd like to remove multicast sip entirely.

Shout now if you have a problem with this. In 2 weeks, its a goner if no one
says anything.

Folks,

Its been slightly over a week since I posted this. Folks may not realize
that this thread is a bis open issue, and I plan on aggressively making sure
these get handled. So, I've renamed the thread, and reposted. 

Rohan recently made some comments on this too:

which is now four in favor. 

Those who spoke against this previously, you have been silent. SPEAK UP!

I'd like to thank Rohan for taking a stab at closing these open issues,
since bis remains our most important deliverable, and the one that still
needs much work.

For ease of tracking and comments, I do think it makes sense to have
separate threads for each of these. So, I am going to take Rohans mail as a
starting point and respond to each in a separate thread, labeled with the
issue number.

Hi,

I agree on this thread. Also, I don't see the problem with this issue,
EVEN if there would be non-INVITE requests in the future that can be
cancelled. The UAC and UAS should know what can be cancelled, and what
can't be, and if the UAC tries to CANCEL something else the UAS simply
returns 400/405/whatever... We could even add some response code saying
"The request can't be cancelled"...

In fact, I am pretty sure the world would have been a better place
without the CANCEL in the first place... 

NOTE: That was NOT a proposal to remove CANCEL from SIP, just my
personal opinion :)

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Let me provide an example of what this would be for, just to elaborate on
the text above.

Consider a proxy that forks an INVITE to two phones, both of which are
maintaining call logs. The first phone answers, so the proxy generates a
CANCEL to the second. Now, does the second phone put an entry into the call
log for a "missed call" or not? In this case, it shouldn't. But, if the UA
cancelled the call since it gave up, it would need to. To distinguish, we
need some kind of reason code/phrase in CANCEL (and BYE) to indicate the
reason.

Rohan is correct that this is new functionality. So, we should decide
whether to put it in bis or not. THere is most definitely new stuff in bis,
but whether this is important enough to go in or not, thats the question.
I'm probably inclined to agree that since this is a non-trivial list to come
up with, it probably belongs elsewhere (most of the new stuff in bis fits
into the category of trivial and really useful). I don't see what it has to
do with cc-diversion or visited, though, but that would be debated when we
come back to this. 

So, the proposal then is to punt this to an extension (and indeed Dave had
one way back when that we could revive if there was interest).

Speak now, or TWO WEEKS hence this will be the final decision.

Correct. However, it's not enough if it is in the guidelines, we also
have to make sure it really IS included in the extension drafts when
needed.

I agree with the proposal.

However, I guess BYE (untagged) should still be allowed to hang up a
call before a final response, assuming that the untagged BYE will be
handled and routed like a CANCEL. Or?

So, BEFORE a final answer has been received:

CANCEL 		Hang up call
CANCEL + tag	NOT ALLOWED!
BYE     	Hang up call
BYE + tag	Terminate early call leg

And, AFTER a 200 final answer has been received (session established):

BYE		NOT ALLOWED???
BYE + tag	Hang up call

Hi,

To implement this, we need a new header ('Reason', for example), and a
number of new codes (assuming the others will be identical to the
existing response codes), so from that point of view one could argue
that it should be a separate draft. 

We should, however, remember that some of the new codes may actually
also be usable as response codes, and one could even argue that we don't
even have to distinguish between them - we simply define a set of codes,
of which some can be used as response codes, some as 'reason codes', and
some as both. 

One idea would be to do as it has been done in H.248 - put all the codes
in a separate draft (annex). The only thing the bis would define is the
TYPE of code, ie 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx and 6xx, and how to act on
those.

Also, this will affect the ISUP-SIP mapping, so I guess that draft will
also be affected (Gonzalo?).

Hello,

        I have some doubts regarding the conferece call setup 

        1. wheather the non-initiator can invite the third or a subsequent
person, which means if A initiates a conference call to B and C,
is it possible for B or C to inivite D?

        2. is SIP signalling unicast or multicast? i,e I want to know
wheather INVITE or subsequent methods are sent sent point to point.
supposing A, B, C and D are in conference, if D wants quit does
it send send BYE just to the initiator or to all of the remaining
participants?

In the Example given in SIP RFC 2543(16.2 section), how does a proxy
adds maddr in Via(maddr=239.128.16.254;ttl=16), header, 
will it add based on the response from location server?	

Thanks,
Madhav

I know. So, different codecs using different ports doesn't work in basic
SIP.

True. So, again: different codecs using different ports doesn't work,
and there MUST be a 1:1 mapping between the m= lines in the request and
the response.

You are correct. I appologise.

>>forbid this kind of behaviour, and state that there MUST be a 1:1 mapping

Yes. And THAT is the point I wanted to make :)

>Current SDP "disallows" separate ports within a single stream.

That may be true, but for example H.248 has a way to solve that.

>(As I myself have said on another list, my
>vocoders can't handle different media encodings on the same port.  So I would respond as you indicated above, >only two media streams though.)

Yes, but then you would indicate two separate streams, and not a single
logical stream using two m=lines...

And, maybe my example wasn't a very clear one. For example:

A sends:

m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2
m=video 200 RTP/AVP 99

B replies:

m=audio 300 RTP/AVP 1
m=audio 400 RTP/AVP 2
m=video 500 RTP/AVP 99

...would not work (2 m= lines are "mapped" into 3 m=lines...), again
because separate ports are used for different codecs.

So, if we in bis define all the restrictions we have defined I guess
it's ok. After that we'll have to fix the issus in the FID draft.

Also, another question: if B does not want the FIRST stream in the list
to be used during the session, does it then answer:

m=audio 100 RTP/AVP 1 2
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 3 4

m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 1 2
m=audio 300 RTP/AVP 3 4

 
>>And, is this really a backward compability issue, since it doesn't work anyway? Or, have I missed
>>something?
>>
>>Then, IF someone wants to "split" an m= line into multiple m=lines

>>ports etc some SIP extension MUST be used.

No problem :) Thanks for your comments!

Hi,

I have been following the discussion about loose routing, and the exact
meaning of strict routing is still unclear to me. Three possible
differences between strict and loose routing I have imagined are:

1. A route header with strict label is popped to replace the request
URI. However, Dean Willis suggested to stop rewriting the request URI.

2. The SIP request should be sent directly to the route header with
strict label. But who can decide this? Who can insert strict and loose
route headers in the SIP message?

3. The route headers with loose label can be bypassed if this improves
network performance or whatever. But then why do we use them anyway?

I hope these 3 thoughts can clarify my question. Can someone explain
strict routing?

Thanks,
Tim.

I'm OK with this as long as the text says that it can be overridden by an
extension that the UAC and the proxy both understand (e.g. caller prefs).

Subject: [Sip] Regarding Conference Call Setup




Hello,

        I have some doubts regarding the conferece call setup

        1. wheather the non-initiator can invite the third or a
subsequent
person, which means if A initiates a conference call to B and C,
is it possible for B or C to inivite D?

  yes. but if B or C have to invite D , then they have to put the current
call leg on hold and then send
  INVITE to D.

        2. is SIP signalling unicast or multicast? i,e I want to know
wheather INVITE or subsequent methods are sent sent point to point.
supposing A, B, C and D are in conference, if D wants quit does
it send send BYE just to the initiator or to all of the remaining
participants?

  usually signalling is unicast. so for multicast , you use group INVITEs

In the Example given in SIP RFC 2543(16.2 section), how does a proxy
adds maddr in Via(maddr=239.128.16.254;ttl=16), header,
will it add based on the response from location server?

Thanks,
Madhav

I agree with the proposal. CANCEL is the proper way to cancel a pending
request, and the CANCEL must match the request (no tags). Use BYE with tags
to terminate specific early call legs.

UAS and proxy code may need to support BYE for backwards compatibility, but
we should discourage people from using a BYE as a CANCEL when acting as the
UAC.

I support the idea of reason codes for BYE/CANCEL. However, I agree that
there are too many other more important issues for bis and the issue should
be addressed by an extension draft.

The SIP spec allows a UA to ignore the rules for request-URI and
Route headers, and just send all requests to an outbound proxy.
The outbound proxy then deals with the routing of the request.
Unfortunately the outbound proxy doesn't follow the procedures of
2543bis section 16.5.

I believe this is a specific case of loose routing, and it doesn't
have or require anything special in the headers to enable it.

It would be unfortunate if the outbound proxy needed some type
of configuration information in order to do this correctly;
especially since the proxy may be an outbound proxy for some
requests, a tandem proxy for some requests, and a destination
proxy for other requests.

I propose the following algorithm for combining all of these
cases:
	the proxy examines the Request-URI, and determines if
	the Request-URI identifies itself.

	if so, move the first entry from the Route header
	to the Request-URI, and go back to first step

	if not, send the request toward the host
	identified in the Request-URI, leaving Request-URI
	and Route header unchanged.

In the third step above, "toward" means either directly to
the identified host, or to another (possibly pre-configured) 
proxy that is by some measure "closer" to the identified host.

One other important case that this algorithm covers is a SIP proxy
that is controlling a firewall (when firewall control is done separately
from outbound services).  When the Request-URI identifies
a host outside the firewall, the outbound proxy needs to send
the request to the firewall controller rather than directly to
the intended destination.

Note this algorithm can also be applied to the UA initiating
the request - the outbound proxy is the pre-configured destination
that is "toward" all other destinations.

This algorithm also covers the routing of the initial INVITE request
that does not contain any Route headers, allowing the request to
be routed through intermediate proxy(ies) to perform termination services.

This algorithm also covers the "pre-loaded" route headers of 16.6,
when the pre-loaded portion is incomplete -- the final route header
in the pre-loaded set would be set to the destination URL (To: header
value).

So by generalizing the procedures to cover the case of the outbound
proxy, we have achieved loose source routing without any syntactic
changes to the headers, and also covered routing of initial requests.

I agree, I would be using separate streams (as defined).

I agree.  B has "messed up" in its response (without indicating some
extension).

Is there a typo above? :)  The second set with the 2nd m= line referring to
video and payload type 99 is the correct answer IMO.

This is pretty much what I have been saying since
IETF 51.

I think the problem is that if the proxy _does_ follow 
16.5 as it is written in bis-04 the path followed is 
mandated.

"When a proxy receives a request, it MUST check for the 
existence of a Route header. If one exists, it MUST pop 
that Route header, and place it (including all URI 
parameters) into the Request-URI."

If we changed the MUSTs to SHOULDs the proxy can ignore
a Route header if that is the right thing. The basic rule
being simply if you do not use the Route do not touch it.

(The text containing confusing references to Route processing 
being like strict IP source routing that appeared in bis-04 
16 and 16.6 should be cut too.)

I don't think we actually need to specify to this level
just provide enough freedom to operate. For example a
Proxy may get a request that does identify itself in
the Request-URI but not want to be forced to follow
the Route to the next hop. Or in the third step a 
proxy may still want to re-write the Request-URI, 
but not touch the Route, and then send on 'loosely'
towards the destination.

Cheers,
Neil.

The difference between strict and loose is hard to
explain as there is no certainty over what loose
means to the SIP community.

> I hope these 3 thoughts can clarify my question. Can someone explain
> strict routing?

The notion of strict source routing in SIP appeared in
bis-04 in reference to the way requests containing a Route
headers are handled. The Route headers contain a set of
servers that the request must visit on its way from one
UA to another. When a server receives a request it MUST
check for the existence of a Route header. If one exists, it
MUST pop that Route header, and place it into the Request-URI.
It then sends the request using the defined procedures of
locating a SIP server basedon the Request URI contents
(Section 1.4.2).

The bis04 says that the way Route headers are handled is
much like strict IP source routing. I think the intention
is to indicate that a request with Route headers has a
pre-determined path to follow, as well as the ultimate
destination, defined.

I however have argued that strict IP source routing is
not a helpful comparison. For one Route headers contain URLs
- strict source routing in IP is more brittle because it uses
IP addresses. Secondly I do not think Route headers have to
be strictly obeyed. An interesting deviation from that
is accepted for a UAC that doesn't support DNS. Such a client
can ignore Route headers and send to a local outbound
proxy. This would appear to set a precedent for disregarding
Route headers provide you do not touch them.

Cheers,
Neil.

Hi Vijaya,

Maybe the work that we are doing at ETSI is of interest to you. SIP is a
major component in 3G (ETSI is one of the 3GPP partners) and EP TIPHON (ETSI
Project: Telecommunications and Internet Protocol Harmonization Over
Networks). 

Please visit www.etsi.org for more info.

Many ETSI standards (GSM, 3G, HiperLan, TETRA, DECT, TIPHON, E-ISDN etc)
include (conformance) test specifications. We are currently producing the
conformance test specifications for SIP (bis4) for TIPHON Release 5. The
test spec. comprises two documents: 1) A set of informal (prose) test
purposes and 2) detailed code for each test purpose written in the testing
language TTCN-3. The TTCN-3 code can be compiled and executed over UDP/TCP
(some adaption software is needed for this).

We will soon have well over 300 test purposes. Work on the corresponding
TTCN-3 test cases started last week. The work is scheduled to be completed
by November/December this year. Currently, the test purposes focus on the
MUST requirements in the RFC. However, EP TIPHON expect to produce a profile
which will say how optional requirements (SHOULD, MAY) are to be handled in
the TIPHON context. When this happens the test suite will be updated
accordingly (early 2002).
 
It is anticipated that the TIPHON test suite will form the basis of a
similar one for 3G (but not until well into 2002).

I will gladly provide you with more details if you wish.

Regards
Anthony Wiles

Hi,

There has been a number of SIP bakeoff events to
test the interoperability of vendor X SIP implementation
with that of vendor Y.

Has a SIP Test Specifications been considered besides
the SIP interops?

Thanks,
Vijaya

Discussions on emergency services in SIP are held on the
e911@cs.columbia.edu
list.  Send a message to e911-request@cs.columbia.edu and specify subscribe
as the body.

In answer to your questions:
1. We have not decided on the architecture.  We have worked on several
aspects of it, but the full architecture is not defined and anyone is
welcome to participate in defining it.  I suspect that we will use an
explicit emergency URL, and define a mechanism for the outbound proxy to
route the call to the PSAP serving the location of the user.  There are many
issues (how does the proxy determine the location, how does the proxy
determine the serving PSAP, ..).

2. I do not think there will be anything in SDP to support emergency use.
There may be recommendations on using any existing QoS mechanisms,
especially
priority (diffserv) mechanisms available to handle the media streams with
priority.

3. The architecture indeed must support end devices which are moving, but
where there is a mechanism to determine location.  The architecture must
support systems where the UA knows where it is, as well as systems where a
downstream proxy knows where the user is.  There are mechanisms, which we
will no doubt reuse, that will translate location to serving PSAP.

Hello Christer,

We are discussing exactly the same things as we discussed in MMUSIC when
the FID draft was first released. Anyway, I will try to put together an
answer to your mail.

First of all, if you send an INVITE with n media lines, the 2xx response
MUST contain n media lines. This is needed because the UAC matches the
nth media line in the INVITE with the nth media line in the 2xx.

Even if we label the lines (using mid, for instance), the UAS still MUST
to return a 2xx with the same number of n lines as the INVITE. Let me
illustrate this with an example:

INVITE
m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 0 8
a=mid:a

200 OK
m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 0
a=mid:a
m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 8
a=mid:a

The example above does NOT work because the UAS does not have a remote
port to send RTCP for the m line that has been added in the 2xx. That's
why we abandoned that solution.

I hope that with this answer and with the FID draft everything is clear
now.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Strrict routing implies that the entire set of SIP nodes which may be
visited is listed, in order of visitation, in the Route header. No other
nodes may be visited by this message, and all the listed nodes MUST be
visited in the given order or the message has "failed".

Loose routing implies that the indicated nodes MUST be visited before the
message can be delivered to the target indicated in the original request
URI. The message may visit other nodes before, between or after any node
specified on the loose route.

Neither sort of route can simply be "ignored".

These definitions of loose and strict source routes are essentially similar
to the definition of those terms as used to discuss IP routing. Where the IP
routing people got them, I've no idea.

SIP, in RFC2543, defines a functional strict source routing mechanism.

We seem to have a consensus that indicates a loose source routing mechanism
is needed.

We seem to have a consensus that it would be useful to be able to interleave
loose and strict routes. That's not a "hard requirement" yet

Expiry of REFER-Created Subscription:

Am I right in supposing that the only way the implicit subscription created
by REFER expires is by explicit unsubscription?  Or is it possible to say
that if a REFER is issued within the context of a call-leg, the subscription
expires when the call-leg does?

Correlation of NOTIFYs:

I have a situation where the same UAC issues two different REFERs to the
same UAS within the same call-leg.  Naturally the order of the returned
NOTIFY requests is indeterminate.  AFAIK it appears I have to specify that
the body of the NOTIFY include not only the status line, but also the To:
header from the final response, in order to let the initiating UAC know
which REFER it is related to.  If this is seen as a general need, perhaps
the minimum information specified in 3.6.2.2 of draft-..-refer might specify
it.

I did agonize over whether the returned To header should include the tag (it
is part of the information needed to hijack the call-leg triggered by the
REFER), but I'm not sure whether the phrase "... MAY include more of a SIP
message ..." in 3.6.2.2 requires that if a header is included it is included
in its entirety..

No, of course that is not true.

The means for adding users to a conference depend on the conference model.
Its all spelled out quite explicitly in:

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-conferencing-mode
ls-01.txt

See the above document.

Matt,
Applying your reasoning to the ISUP-SIP interface, you cannot understand why
is that interface being defined, and perhaps becoming an standar?
Do you think it should be left implementation specific?
I don't.
Regards.
Walter.

Hi Bill,

I'm doing a Last Call Review on draft-ieft-sip-call-auth-02.txt and have the
following comments:  

Pure NITS:
----------

1. General (1st example: Section 5.2.4, 1st paragraph) : Propose that the
phrase "termination Policy Decision Point"  be replaced with "terminating
Policy Decision Point". 

2. General:  Propose that the details of the message flows in section 6 have
numbers to correlate the message with the appropriate description.  (I had a
simpler proposal to do a general sweep to ensure that the paragraphs began
with something like:  "Upon receipt of the INVITE, the UAS ....".  However,
I also noticed that there isn't a text description for every message, see
point 5 below for details on at least one of these. I do recognize that some
of the processing is annotated in the flow itself, so overall I think the
technical content is there somewhere, so I have classified this as a NIT). 


Technical points/inconsistencies:
---------------------------------

1. Section 6.1.1 : The implicit assumption here is that the 180/3 will
always contain an SDP (as the Originating Proxy knows about the media
characteristics from 183). This assumption should be explicitly stated.
Propose that the following sentence be added to the end of the 1st
paragraph: "This model has an implicit assumption that the 180/3 always
contains an SDP,   thus the Originating Proxy knows the media
characteristics upon receipt of the 183 message." 

2. Section 6.1.1, para 8: the sentence should be rephrased to: "Upon receipt
of the 183 message, the UAC stores the Media-Authorization-Token."

3. Section 6.1.1. paragraph 9: a NIT, but consistent with rewording in point
3. Propose rewording the last part of this paragraph beginning with the
phrase: "... along with Authorization..." as " along with the previously
stored Media-Authorization-Token."

4. Section 6.1.2, paragraph 2: "Since the Destination SIP-proxy ....
initiates a Policy-Setup message to the termination Policy Decision Point
(PDPt)." - suggest that the phrase "on receipt of an INVITE" be added to the
end of the above sentence for clarity, to make this - "Since the Destination
SIP-proxy .... initiates a Policy-Setup message to the termination Policy
Decision Point (PDPt), on receipt of an INVITE."

5. Section 6.1.2, paragraph 3: For clarity, propose the following as the
last sentence:  "The Token is placed in the INVITE message and forwarded to
the UAS." 

6. Section 6.1.2, next to the last paragraph (10): RSVP-RESVo should be
RSVP-RESVt.

7. Section 6.1.2, last paragraph: Reword as:  "Upon receipt of the
RSVP-RESVCONFo, the UAS sends the 200 OK and awaits the ACK response from
the far end UAC."

8. Section 6.2.1 - Next to the last paragraph. The phrase RSA-REQ should be
replaced with DSA-REQ (more of a NIT, really).

9 Section 6.2.1 - Either remove the last sentence or add the 200 OK and Ack
to the flow and add a sentence indicating that "Upon receipt of the RSVP
RESVCONFo message, the UAC sends a 200 OK to the OP." 

10. Section 6.2.2 - Last paragraph. The RSA-REQ should be DSA-REQ.  

11. Section 6.2.2 - Last paragraph. Either delete the last sentence and
replace UAC with UAS or better yet, just remove the " which is acknowledged
by UAC via DSA-ACK message" clause from the next to the last sentence. 

12. Section 6.2.2. - Figure 4 - either remove the 200 OK,  or add an ACK and
the following 2 sentences to the end of 6.2.2.: 
"After sending the DSA-ACK, the UAS sends a 200 OK to the DP.  The 200 OK is
acknowledged by an ACK from the DP to the UAS."

Does this mean that u feel that the problems with UDP 
have been solved in the draft?

Has anyone on the list build a large SIP server farm 
that supports UDP including fail-over if one of the SIP 
servers should fail?

Hola Gonzalo,

Yes, this is how it's done in the basic SIP, and I think that we can
agree on that is how it will be in bis.

However, that does not give one the opportunity to use different codecs
for different ports, and that is the other issue I brought up.

That is true if you assume that you must have a 1:1 mapping in the
request and response, which I think we have agreed will be the case in
bis. But, my issue was to come up with an extension/mechanism that gives
us the oportunity to have 1:1 logical stream mapping, BUT one stream may
consist of multiple m= lines. Of course every node must then understand
that extension to make it work, so we would have to define an option-tag
for it.
 
>I hope that with this answer and with the FID draft everything is clear
>now.

It is not about the FID draft. I DO understand what it does, but the
point was that it currently doesn't solve the issue I brought up :) 

So, the question is: are we not going to support different codecs on
different ports, within in single logical stream (indicated by the mid:a
for both m= lines), in SIP - unless it's done in both directions, in the
same way, so that we can have a 1:1 m= line mapping, and then group them
together using FID???

Hi,

No, this was a new example :) But, I'll use different media types to
make it more clear.

A sends:

m=video 100 RTP/AVP 99
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 3 4

Now, B does not support video, so it replies:

m=video 0 RTP/AVP 99 (Note: Port set to zero!)
m=audio 200 RTP/AVP 3 4

Is this correct?

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-100rel-04.txt
	Pages		: 18
	Date		: 19-Sep-01
	
This document specifies an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) providing reliable provisional response messages. This
extension uses the option tag org.ietf.sip.100rel.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Jonathan,

Won't this simply encourage UA implementors to send a tagged BYE whenever
they receive multiple provisional responses (especially for provisional
responses specifying early media). If UA's start doing this then it will
nullify the usefulness of forking, or rather, mean that forking only has a
good chance of working when local ringback is used. However the callee
doesn't actually know that the call was forked and that local ringback would
therefore be advisable to increase the likely hood of the forked branch not
being "rejected" by the UA.

Robert.

Hi,

the document
'http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-conferencing-mod
els-01.txt' says that
the multicast address can be obtained from media line (c=) parameter of SDP,
in which case could you please
explain the maddr field in any of sip headers? Actually Iam confused after
seeing the
example given in 16.2.1 in RFC 2543, how do I relate the following multicast
addresses:

maddr=239.128.16.254;ttl=16
and
c=IN IP4 224.2.0.1/127 (what is this '/127' )

Madhav

Hi Robert,

I am not Jonathan, but I'll comment anyway :)

>they receive multiple provisional responses (especially for provisional

First, I think that early media is a separate problem, which has to be
solved, and there is one proposal posted by Jonathan a while ago. 

It IS true that by start sending BYE messages to all-but-one of the legs
you can solve the problem of getting early media from different servers
mixed up, but I don't think that is the only reason why one would start
sending BYE messages. So, from a basic SIP point of view one could argue
that this is not a very big issue (personally I think that early media
is a big enough reason, until we have another solution for that).

However, I think the use of BYE for early legs gets much more clear when
we start talking about different SIP extensions, for example the
manyfolks draft, ISUP transparency etc etc, ie scenarios where the
provisional responses actually may trigger lots of action in the client.

Also, if one doesn't want forking, there are other ways to achieve that.
There is the caller preferences draft, OR one can simply choose to build
a non-forking SIP network...

>However the callee doesn't actually know that the call was forked and that local ringback would

The callee DOES know about the forking, because it starts receiving
provisional responses with different tags. 

No, tags are NOT mandatory in provisional responses, but without them
you can't send a tagged BYE either, so...

Hi,

A correction to my own mail. Seemed like I messed up who the "callee"
is... :)

>>However the callee doesn't actually know that the call was forked and that local ringback would
>>therefore be advisable to increase the likely hood of the forked branch not

So, the callee is the one who sends the provisional responses, ie the
UAS, right? :)

Anyway, I think it is a network architecture/UA configuration issue
if/how/when the UAS shall send local ringback, and when it shall not.
Also, IF we will define some kind of early media negotiation mechanism
the UAS has to ask for permission for early media anyway.

And, the fact is: nobody wants to listen to early media which is a mix
of RTP streams from 10 different servers...

Another way would be to have an indicator if early media is wanted or
not. The UAC can insert it for the whole session in the INVITE, but it
could also be inserted by the forking proxy, if it has some kind of
information about the different servers. Maybe it should also be
possible for the UAC to indicate that to a specific UAS after the
provisional response indicating early media has arrived. Something like:
"hey, I will not terminate your leg, but I have other legs too, so
please don't send any early media". Or something like that...

Right, so the UAC should not be canceling the forked call leg because it
can't play multiple early media streams [which means the UAC is overriding
proxy routing decisions] but rather the UAC should be saying "I don't
want/need your early media". [for instance, through JR's early media draft]

It seems like a UAC should only cancel a forked early call leg when it knows
that it is impossible to communicate with that endpoint. Hence I am not
saying that the mechanism is bad but it should be carefully described in
what circumstances it should be used (since it is easy to abuse it).

Hi,

Yes, by using the early media draft (or something similar), OR by using
some header in the INVITE/PRACK...

And, like I said in an earlier mail, early media is probably not the
most critical reason for the tagged BYE, but it is one case where it can
be used.

Yup.

Hello Christer,

What you are asking for is exactly what FID does. Please, read the 04
version of the draft. It contains many examples.

The following one is taken directly from the draft:

The session description below would be the SDP sent by a SIP user
agent using a cellular access. The user agent supports GSM on port 
30000 and AMR on port 30002.



         v=0
         o=Laura 289083124 289083124 IN IP4 two.example.com
         t=0 0
         c=IN IP4 131.160.1.112
         a=group:FID 1 2
         m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 3
         a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000
         a=mid:1
         m=audio 30002 RTP/AVP 97
         a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000
         a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,5,7; mode-change-period=2; mode-change-

I don't like this, but it's purely for the reason that
it grates with me slightly that one day we're going to
end up with a spec that mandates X, but this mandate
is overridden by another spec (which is not obsoleting).

I'm relatively clueless in these matters, however, so
maybe this is deemed as perfectly acceptable IETF-wise....

Sounds good to me.

 The multicast address in the maddr parameter of the
headers indicates the address for SIP messages. The
multicast address in the c= line indicates the address
where the endpoint wants to listen to the media
streams. They are totally for different purpose.

 Here, 127 is the ttl. 
You need to refer to the SDP RFC 2327 for more
details.

Hi,

Expiry of REFER-Created Subscription:

The 3rd paragraph of section 6 in draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-05,  has the
following text,

"If the Transferor's agent does
   not wish to participate in the remainder of the REFER process and has
   no intention of assisting with recovery from transfer failure, it
   could emit a BYE to the Transferee as soon as the REFER transaction
   completes. "

this may be interpreted that a subscription dies with its call leg. Does this
behaviour apply in general to refer, or only cc-transfer?

Another question comes to mind, how should the Transferor 'terminate'
a REFER that was sent outside of an existing call or call leg?.

Send another REFER with Expires = 0, like with SUBSCRIBE ?
Maybe termination for this situation is not that important ?

Francois.

I am aware of this example, but again it assumes that there is a 1:1
mapping of the m= lines in the request and the response. What I am
talking about is a scenario where, for example, the UAC can receive both
codecs on the same port, so it only includes one m=line, but the UAS can
not, so it includes two m= lines.

UAC/INVITE

m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 3 97

UAS/200 OK

m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 3
m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 97

Again, this does NOT work in basic SIP, so let's focus on the extension.

My proposal is to use an identifier (sid, mid, whatever...) that defines
a single logical stream, no matter how many m= lines there are. Every m=
line with the same identifier then belongs to the same single logical
stream.

Example:

UAC/INVITE.

m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 3 97
a=sid:1

UAS/200 OK

m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 3
a=sid:1
m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 97
a=sid:1
m=audio 1000


Later, the UAC wants to replace the stream (sid:1) with a new stream.
However, this time it is not available to receive both codecs on the
same port.

UAC/re-INVITE

m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 4
a=sid:1
m=audio 40000 RTP/AVP 5
a=sid:1

The UAS, however, can now handle both of those codecs on the same port,
so it indicates that in a single m=line

UAS/200 OK

m=audio 60000 RTP/AVP 4 5
a=sid:1

I hope that this example shows my point, and why I think that FID
doesn't solve it :)

Hello Christer,

You are raising issues that have already been discussed in this thread.

As I said in a previous mail, REGARDLESS of the fact that we label or
not the m lines, the SDP in the 2xx MUST have the same number of m lines
as the SDP in the INVITE (or in the ACK, if that was the case). As I
explained in a previous mail, this is needed because RTCP has to be
sent.

Therefore, take the SDP of my example and put it in an INVITE. The 2xx
response will have 2 m lines as well. The UAS issuing the 2xx cannot
receive both codec in the same port because it would screw RTCP
statistics up. Besides, the RTP RFC explicitily says that different m
lines have to be demultiplexed using port numbers, no RTP headers.

Again, we had this discussions already a long time ago in MMUSIC.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hi,

When I read the thread about the tagged BYE requests, for early call
legs, it was mentioned that a UAS doesn't know if a request has been
forked or not. However, the UAS, and/or intermediate proxy servers, may
need that information for different kind of reasons, eg related to early
media.

So, I came up with an idea: what about adding a via-fork parameter.
Every proxy in the path could then indicate if it has forked the request
or not, and the other proxies, and the UAS, can then do decissions
depending on that information.

The syntax could be something like:

via-fork = "fork" = fork
fork = "no" | "sfork" | "pfork"

(sfork = sequential fork)
(pfork = parallel fork)

Of course, for the good old backward compability reasons, it could not
be a MUST to use the parameter, but maybe a SHOULD...?

Comments? Anyone thinks this could be useful?

Regards,

Well, "a long time ago" people only talked about voice and G.711 anyway

Does this really matter? 

The Referror (playing the role of implicit subscriber) has some
period of time its willing to listen for notifies. With the implicit
subscription, it's not telling the far end how long this is. Any
notifies that arrive after that time, it 481s. If it decides to
shorten that time prematurely (because a bye was sent for example)
the net effect was if it had the shorter time in mind to begin with.

The Referred party has no clue how long something cares about getting
notified. Its only recourse is to send interesting events (of which
there may be only one) until it receives a 481 to a NOTIFY. If its
unwilling to send any more events, it just stops. At some point the
referror is going to give up on listening.

So, the two endpoints don't get trapped into any infinite 
responsibilities. The only place problems can remain is in
the middle. Will anything in the middle care about the period 
in which NOTIFYs to a REFER can occur. I can't think of why.
If they do, then the implicit subscription is a mistake.

So, setting my own distaste for the implicit subscription concept aside,
unless someone comes up with an explicit scenario where something in
the middle breaks because it doesn't know when the subscription terminates,
I propose this is a non-issue.

You've identified an ugly problem (and I'll point out that it's another
side-effect of the implicit subscription). How do we want to solve it?
We have the option of saying you only get one refer inside any given
call leg (just like you only get one subscription in a call leg).

Given that people are wanting to use the common call leg as the
key to admission policy for the REFER, and that recovery from a
failed transfer will likely involve a second REFER to somewhere else,
we probably do want to solve it in some fashion other than disallowing
more than one REFER. What you've proposed isn't right.  In particular,
you may not have such a To: header to play with if you REFER to a non-SIP URL.
I also feel it would be better to have the correlation show up in the signalling
instead of the payload (in case things in the middle care someday - the payload
may be e-e encrypted).

The only correlation information that'll be unique will be the CSeq of the
REFER. The refer-to URL and its derivates (like the To: header you wanted
to use) are not guaranteed to be unique - what if the two refers above
just happened to be to the same URL?

How about returning the CSeq of the REFER as a parameter on the Event
header in the NOTIFY? Something like

NOTIFY <stuff>
Event: refer; cseq=13344

The thing being returned only has to be syntactically valid on a per-header
basis (see the sip-mimetypes draft). Removing the tag still leaves you with
a valid To: header. There is no requirement that the sipfrag be a subset
of the response to the triggered request at all. You can build things that
way, but others don't have to. Remember the minimal implementation that
with return only 200 or 503 status lines.

Does this really matter? 

[PTT] Yes, it does, because the Contact address supplied with the REFER may
have a limited period of validity.

The Referror (playing the role of implicit subscriber) has some
period of time its willing to listen for notifies. With the implicit
subscription, it's not telling the far end how long this is. Any
notifies that arrive after that time, it 481s. If it decides to

So, the two endpoints don't get trapped into any infinite 
responsibilities. The only place problems can remain is in

I propose this is a non-issue.

Given that people are wanting to use the common call leg as the
key to admission policy for the REFER, and that recovery from a
failed transfer will likely involve a second REFER to somewhere else,
we probably do want to solve it in some fashion other than disallowing
more than one REFER. What you've proposed isn't right.  In particular,
you may not have such a To: header to play with if you REFER to a non-SIP
URL.
I also feel it would be better to have the correlation show up in the
signalling
instead of the payload (in case things in the middle care someday - the
payload
may be e-e encrypted).

The only correlation information that'll be unique will be the CSeq of the
REFER. The refer-to URL and its derivates (like the To: header you wanted
to use) are not guaranteed to be unique - what if the two refers above
just happened to be to the same URL?

How about returning the CSeq of the REFER as a parameter on the Event
header in the NOTIFY? Something like

NOTIFY <stuff>
Event: refer; cseq=13344

[PTT] Good idea.  I thought of CSeq, then realized the NOTIFY CSeq would be
in a different space.  You've solved that problem.

The thing being returned only has to be syntactically valid on a per-header
basis (see the sip-mimetypes draft). Removing the tag still leaves you with
a valid To: header. There is no requirement that the sipfrag be a subset
of the response to the triggered request at all. You can build things that
way, but others don't have to. Remember the minimal implementation that
with return only 200 or 503 status lines.

If the Contact address is no longer valid, the Referror won't get the
NOTIFY, so it can't send back the 481.

In which case, either the Contact address resolves to some other UA,
which will 481 the NOTIFY, or the NOTIFY transaction will timeout.

If the Contact address is no longer valid, the Referror won't get the
NOTIFY, so it can't send back the 481.

And the below two paragraphs deal, I think, with what happens when that

Not in all ways, version would need to increment.

This would specifically be for those 
devices that respond to holds with holds. 

Many current products that use the 0.0.0.0 
mechanism for hold, will return 0.0.0.0 in 
response to a hold.

Example:
After a call has been established, 
A sends reinvite with 0.0.0.0 in SDP.  
B responds with 0.0.0.0 in SDP.  
A sends reinvite without SDP to B; 
B should not return 0.0.0.0 in SDP 
unless it desires to keep the session 
on hold.

After a call has been established, 
A sends reinvite with "inactive" in SDP.  
B responds with "inactive" in SDP.  
A sends reinvite without SDP to B; 
B should not return "inactive" in SDP 
unless it desires to keep the session 
inactive.

It has that meaning within invite-without-sdp; 
I agree that it doesn't necessarily have
that meaning in reinvite-without-sdp.

I was just stating that "MUST" would mean
that it can't have that meaning within
reinvite-without-sdp.

I am hoping to get an understanding of what to expect in a SIP-to-ISDN
interworking scenario.  

Specifically, I'm in search of something that will indicate what 18x
message should be generated upon:

a. the receipt of an ISDN ALERT message, and

b. the receipt of ISDN Progress/Call Proceeding message,

immediately after a SETUP message is forwarded to the PSTN as a result
of an INVITE.

Unfortunately, I've only stumbled across text that speaks to SS7
interworking.   What might be expected in an ISDN application?  Is there
a reference that someone could point me to?

Thank you so much!

Eric

Hello,

If you know that the phone is ringing (an ALERT Q.931 message, for
instance) you send a 180 Ringing. If you receive a notification
indicating that the call is progressing, but you do not know for sure
whether the user is being alterted or not, you send a 183 Session
Progress message.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello Gonzalo,

Thank you!  Would you be able to point me to a(ny) SIP (or other) RFC
that details this?

Thanks,

Hello,

The behavior I just described can be found in the ISUP/SIP mapping
draft. That draft speaks about ISUP, but it also gives some general
advices about how to map SIP to other signalling protocols. You might
want to read the H.323 to SIP stuff as well.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hi,

I think this thread is related to the discussion about the replacements
of media stream.

So, since basic SIP requires the m= lines to be in the same order during
the session, I don't understand why we should allow re-INVITE without
SDP in the first place... I thought that one of the ideas of including
all m= lines during the whole session was to make the system robust. I
also thought that one of the good things with re-INVITEs was to give the
call state back to nodes that may have lost it, but how will that
happend if there is no SDP in the re-INVITE (since there will be none in
the ACK either)?

Also, I don't like the idea of using ACK. I think we have to accept that
basic SIP has an offer/answer model for the media negoatiation - nothing
else. If A doesn't like the parameters it gets back from B it simply has
to send a new re-INVITE, or a BYE, but NOT "change the media parameters"
back in the ACK. It is not even sure that B manages to do that, and
since there is no response to ACK, how does it inform A about that?

Also, I think that one has to live with a moment of silence if he start
changing codecs/ports for a stream during the call - no matter which
method is used. And, how often is one going to that, anyway? Yes, one
may put the call on hold, and/or add/release streams, but that is
another case.

Interworking pure ISUP and pure SIP is implementation specific. To be 
clear, I'm referring to a call setup from an ISUP network to a Softswitch, 
and the Softswitch generating a SIP/SDP setup based on policy. The same 
goes for a call in the other direction.

However, transporting or preserving ISUP information using SIP requires a 
standard, thus we have SIP-T modes of encapsulation and mapping. This is 
the way to go if you do not want the Softswitch to generate the call details.

I hope I'm making myself clear as I'm kind of jet lagged right now.

Hi,

I support this. Let's get rid of SIP over multicast.

Hello,

I concur with the proposal as well. The UAC {\SHOULD} send a {\BYE} in
that situation. As far as it is not a {\MUST}, UACs that only understand
the class of the response (400) but not 481 specifically will be
compliant.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello,

Let's keep this out of bis, as you propose. About Dave's draft, I saw
the header some where, but not the whole draft... don't know if it was
published at all or if I just missed it.

Gonzalo

Hello,

Let's make it a {\MUST}.

Implementing a service that takes for granted that proxies will not
CANCEL the remaining branches will only work if all the proxies
understand caller preferences, regardless of whether we write SHOULD or
MUST in the spec. As soona s there is one proxy in the chain that does
not understand caller preferences the service will fail.

So, since the service implementor is sure that all his proxies
understand caller preferences, this MUST in the spec for "standard"
proxies is not confusing.

The only thing is that the caller preferences spec will have to say
that, when proxies doe not CANCEL branches, the UAC should not should
not consider the INVITE transaction terminated after 16 seconds after
the first 2xx.

Regards,

Gonzalo

I'm opposed. REGISTER using multicast works nicely. Given the choices of
the DHCP working group, the DHCP option will be effectively unusable
with any existing DHCP server that is not specifically written to
support the option, so I wouldn't count on it any time soon.

Hello,

About bug#146 (bug#24): re-enable media streams. Let's try to resolve
it.

We have already figured out that this bog does not have anything to do
with labeling m lines and with the FID draft... good!

Let's analyze how much we gain re-using m lines. m lines that are
answered with port 0 do not need to carry associated "a" lines anymore.
Therefore, we will have something like:
m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 3

This is 19 bytes.

However, since the media stream has been disabled, we do not need the
payload type (codec). Besides, we do not need to carry RTP/AVP either.
So, the m line would look like:

m=audio 0

This is 9 bytes.

So, every time we disable a stream we have to carry 9 extra-bytes in the
SDP. While it might be desirable to get rid of this garbage, I do not
think it is such a big deal.

So, if there is just one implementation that would be broken if we allow
re-use of media streams, I am happy disallowing it in the spec.

However, if all the implementations can cope with this, we can safely
allow it. So far I think that nobody has spoken up saying that reusing m
lines would break his implementation... if you have one, SPEAK UP!

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello,

Shall we disallow using multicast for requests different than REGISTER?
It seems that SIP over multicast is broken for INVITEs and CANCELs. As
you point out, sending REGISTERs to the well-known multicast address
seems useful.

Regards,

Gonzalo

I don't understand this paragraph. Unless I'm misunderstanding the whole
discussion, the proposal is that it will be illegal in the future to
send a CANCEL for any non-INVITE request and it will be illegal for any
SIP device to implement CANCEL for non-INVITE. (It's always been legal
for UAS to not implement CANCEL.)

Well, nobody has to support it.

Make that two opposed, though not vehemently in our case. Multicast
registration has worked fine for us for a while--I'd hate to lose it.
Anyone for deprecate Multicast with the exception of REGISTERs, or should I
say, is anyone using Multicast with any SIP method other than REGISTER?

If that is indeed the choice, then we should remove 1xx responses for
non-INVITE requests. As long as there are 1xx responses, non-INVITE
requests can sometimes not complete immediately.

Plus, multicast is nice to have for updating several registrars at once,
scalably.

Another reason for keeping this is that multicast REGISTER can be
programmed to avoid the "reboot building" problem of 20,000 phones all
registering more or less at the same time when the power comes back on.
We haven't pursued this, but it would be easy (as an implementation
choice) to implement a form of RTCP reconsideration that causes phones
to back off when they see lots of other registrations, rather than
causing the poor registrar to drop almost all registrations. I wouldn't
be surprised if, just like RTCP, somebody eventually calls us on this
problem. (Not that other protocols, such as DHCP, don't have the same
problem...)

For non-REGISTER: I wonder if there is a need/use for 'non-confirmed'
requests, e.g., notifications that are meant for a large group, but with
no need for reliability. This would address some of the concerns in
terms of response implosion. Beyond unreliable notifications, once we
have a reliable multicast infrastructure in place, there may well be
other applications where the current concerns don't apply. It should be
noted that many other event systems have this mode, as it is much more
scalable than individual event notification. I would hate to have this
ruled impermissible. Since SIP, being transport-neutral, should be able
to make use of reliable multicast transport, it would seem short-sighted
to rule this out of scope completely.

Whether this has to be in the main draft or not is a separate question.
For non-REGISTER, it might be best to define this more specifically for
particular methods and transport infrastructures. We already have
slightly different retransmit behavior, for example, for UDP and TCP, so
this is not completely new.

Hi,

At least I support the idea that we should allow the re-use of streams,
if implementations support that.

However, I would like to discuss (I have mentioned this earlier) if we
really should use the port number. How would it work in ATM? Also, in
Megaco there is a draft on using SDP for TDM circuits. I don't remember
if the m= line is used there, though, but the point is that the port
number is very IP specific (compare to 0.0.0.0 to put call on hold).

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

I would leave it as a SHOULD. While building services
on the strength of any feature not being a MUST is
no good, there is more to it than that.

Making it a MUST does not remove the need for a UA to
be able to deal with multiple 200s to an INVITE. A CANCEL
and 200 could still cross on the wire. I also don't think
that being able to do that is an unfair burden on an intelligent
end-point in a peer to peer protocol. Finally saying that caller
prefs can be a valid reason in particular circumstances to
ignore canceling any outstanding branches on 2xx/6xx makes
it a SHOULD according to RFC 2119 for me. But I would trade for
a finished spec ;)

Cheers,
Neil

Hello Christer,

Yes, setting the port to zero is IP specific. However, current SIP
systems use that mechanism to refuse streams, so, regardless of whether
we come up with a new mechanism for refusing streams for ATM, TDM, etc.,
or even a generic mechanism, we have to resolve the re-use of streams in
an IP environment. This is a backwards compatibility issue.

Regards,

Gonzalo

This would be a justification if Priority had been included in all and
everything, but Priority appears to be one of those headers where the usage
is directed to where it is useful. In the bis draft it is only included in
INVITE.

Your response implies to me that you suggesting a transaction level
understanding of Priority. I was not aware that Priority applied at the
transaction level, but rather than at the application level. As INFO is only
used within an existing session, then that gives the entire session priority
- which brings us back to a question of what circumstances exist where
Priority information is not available at the time of sending an INVITE
request, but is available at the time of sending a subsequent INFO request.

No, but it removes the need for the UA to handle multiple non-2xx final
responses.

A working forking proxy will not send back >1 non-2xx for
an INVITE. Only the lowest number response code gets sent back
(anything lower, other than a 2xx, coming in late would be
dropped). 2xxs for INVITES being a special case that must be
sent back due to the INV/2xx/ACK reliability mech'n.

Cheers,
Neil.

Sorry, I thought I was answering another thread... what I wanted to say
is that having proxies cancel branches after the first 2xx let the UA
know when to terminate the INVITE trasaction. That is, the UA receives
the first 2xx and 16 secs later it can safely remove state for that
trasaction. If proxies do not CANCEL branches, a second 2xx might arrive
3 minutes later to the UA... this would imply that the UA would have to
store trasaction state "for ever", just in case another 2xx arrives.

Regards,

Gonzalo

I agree with this. Let's define CANCEL for non-INVITEs as a "do nothing"
on the server side and let's remove 1xx responses for non-INVITEs.

Then, for backwards compatibility, my understanding is that a "200 OK"
for a CANCEL just means "I have received the CANCEL. You can stop
retransmitting it". It does not imply that we are trying to cancel
anything. In fact, if a UAS responds with a 2xx an INVITE request and
later it receives a CANCEL, it still answers the CANCEL with a 200 OK.

Therefore, if an old UAC still sends a CANCEL for a non-INVITE request,
a "200 OK" response for the CANCEL seems appropriate to me.

Regards,

Gonzalo

We still need at least 100's to stop retransmissions when proxying
non-INVITEs, no?

The problem I see here is the difference between complete immidately,
and the ability to cancel before completion. For example this all
started because of REGISTER, sending 100 then attempting to do the
database magic (possibly over a network) makes sense to restrict
retransmission, yet providing full rollback semantics to allow the
REGISTER to cancel is trickier.

I'd agree with this just not getting rid of 100s for non-INVITEs

The problem here is that if the UAC does not compute a new timestamp
every time it retransmits a request, the RTO calculated will be
inaccurate.

This problem is present in TCP as well, and implementations can resolve
it in two ways. 

1) The first one is the simple and easy solution. It is what TCP tahoe
and TCP Reno do. They do not use retransmitted segment to calculate
RTOs. When a segment is retransmitted the ACK for that segment is not
taken into consideration for RTT measurement. Therefore, a SIP UAC would
do the same with retransmitted requests. Just forget about the timestamp
in the response.

2) This is the accurate but complicated method. We update the timestamps
everytime we retransmit something. TCP Las Vegas uses timestamps in
order to compute a very accurate RTO. Simulations show that TCP Las
Vegas achieves a higher throughput, but it is not widely implemented...
folks prefer the less effective but simpler algorithm. Applying this to
SIP, a SIP UAC might update the timestamps in its retransmissions, but
that would be a pain.


I would outline in bis both possible behaviors and then let implementors
choose which one they want to use.

Regards,

Gonzalo

As I have tried to say numerous times before, nobody has to implement
CANCEL even under the current state of affairs. If CANCELing REGISTER is
difficult (which seems likely), just don't do it. CANCEL is advisory, an
optimization. Somehow the "doesn't work for all cases" seems to get
confused with "it's never useful".

There are three possible views of the non-INVITE world:

(1)everything must complete immediately (i.e., within 500 ms) -> no
1xx, no CANCEL

(2) most non-INVITE complete immediately almost all the time, but on
occasion they don't
  (2a) but these things are never cancellable (whether with CANCEL or
something else)
  (2b) for some cases, they are cancellable

I've argued for 2b, simply because I can't rule out this case and since
it seems to reflect reality in other spheres of life.

CANCEL makes sense for view 2b, although it has been argued that you
could also devise a new method for methods where 2b holds. (However,
that clearly only works if overlapping transactions are allowed.) That
is an approximation to CANCEL, but not quite functionally equivalent,
due to the different forking proxy behavior.

Indeed. We have assigned someone to track every MUST/MAY/SHOULD for the
basic implementation to make sure that it is accounted for.

Hi:

Quick question:

Once the Refer has received a 202 Accepted is there a time limit by which
the NOTIFY should arrive? We could recommend a timer for the receipt of a
NOTIFY, if by the expiry of this timer the NOTIFY does not arrive the UA
simply goes away. The other possibility would be to allow the transferor to
hang up, but there may be a case that the transferor is an automaton.

Something like this needs to go into the refer draft - any other mechanism
that makes sense?

Thanks,

Sriram

This is an aspect of one of the questions Tom was asking in the
Observations on the use of REFER thread - specifically this is
the "when does the implicit subscription expire" question.
 
I've posted an assertion that the implicit subscription expires
implicitly (when one of the two endpoints quits caring - and that
the choice of when to quit caring is _totally_ up to endpoints
individually). If you've not read that thread, please do so and
comment.

Once the Refer has received a 202 Accepted is there a time limit by which
the NOTIFY should arrive? We could recommend a timer for the receipt of a
NOTIFY, if by the expiry of this timer the NOTIFY does not arrive the UA
simply goes away. The other possibility would be to allow the transferor to
hang up, but there may be a case that the transferor is an automaton.

Something like this needs to go into the refer draft - any other mechanism
that makes sense? 

Thanks, 

Sriram

Totally agree. I would like to add one more general case for the reason to
leverage multicast by SIP:
Whenever there is only one possible and relevant UAS who will response the
multicast request in the multicast group.
The pattern is:

Multicast request to a multicast group and
Only one possible UAS sends unicast response back.

Hi,

I STILL don't see why this is a big issue at all.

No matter what request the UAC tries to CANCEL, the response to that
request will indicate if the request was canceled or not. 487 (Request
Terminated) means that the request was canceled, another response code
means it wasn't. Like I said before, it is not even sure the UAS will
allow one to CANCEL an INVITE either (especially not a re-INVITE, I
would assume).

However, if we want to allow CANCEL only for INVITEs, that's fine.

Regards,

I agree it should work, for backward compability, like the 0.0.0.0 to
put media on hold. But, at the same time I think we should define a new
mechanism (using an SDP attribute again, I guess) to encourage people
not to use the port-zero-mechanism in future implementations.

How would the client know there is only one?
How would the server know its the only one?

Sounds like what you want is anycast, not multicast. Anycast is workable
with sip, since it really looks like unicast from a transport perspective.

I just don't see how this works under any amount of packet loss.

Lets say there are three registrars. A UAC sends a multicast REGISTER, which
is received by two of the three. The UAC will get two 200 OK. According to
the spec, it now stops retransmitting the request, since it got a 200 OK.
But, since the third registrar never got the request, the registration is
not updated there.

To fix that, we'd have to basically retransmit continously for a while,
independent of any responses, in the hopes that we hit every registrar. The
client has no way to know if this succeeds. It results in lots of network
traffic, probably much less traffic than just sending three separate unicast
transactions. It also introduces another transaction model.

To be honest, if you want to establish registration state at multiple
servers, you are much better off using time tested and well understood
database replication protocols in the back end between the servers.

I'll note that this still remains a problem in theory only for RTCP.

The primary issue is that as specified, multicast operation just doesn't
work under anything but perfect conditions. So, it either needs to be fixed,
or if it can't be fixed and there are other ways to achieve the same ends,
it has to go. I don't want to be adding things, I want to be removing them.

I agree with Gonzalo. He's exactly right. If its a SHOULD, then the UA will
have to CANCEL everything or else keep the transactions around forever. If
its a MUST, its just 16s.

I am happy to make the text something like "...MUST cancel unless requested
not to by the client through some extension" so that we leave room for
caller prefs.

That might actually be a bad thing for INVITE. CANCEL is the preferred way
to hang up a call before a final response since its the only reliable way to
do so. However, if the server doesn't implement it, the call can't be hung
up. I'd call that an interoperability failure. I think that if a UA
implements INVITE, it probably needs to implement BYE and CANCEL.

Indeed, that is the question. If it doesn't always work, is it still useful?
To answer that, you have to think about what it means for cancel to "work".
I can think of several dimensions to this:

1. it works because it causes the transaction to complete immediately
2. it works because it causes the transaction to generate a 487 response

Even though CANCEL for INVITE doesn't always "work" for definition (2), it
always works for definition (1) since it always results in immediate
completion of the transaction one way or another, so long as the server
supports CANCEL. Would CANCEL for INVITE be useful if it didn't always
perform (1)? I'd say no. From a users perspective, it is not acceptable to
hit "stop" and for nothing to happen.

So, I would propose to define the CANCEL for a method "works" if it always
(under reasonable network conditions) results in rapid completion of the
transaction, whether it is success (because the 2xx and CANCEL pass on the
wire), or failure (including 487).

If this definition is suitable, then we can draw some conclusions:

1. If a non-INVITE transaction is protracted, CANCEL is only useful if all
servers have to support cancel for that method.

2. If a non-INVITE transaction is not protracted, CANCEL is a no-op since
sending it or not achieves the same result.

So, let me propose the following compromise text based on these conclusions:

"Servers that implement INVITE MUST support CANCEL for INVITE transactions.
CANCEL is not defined for other methods in this specification. Extensions
MAY define other methods for which CANCEL is useful; those extensions should
specify that CANCEL is allowed and is mandatory if the extension method is
supported".


How is that?

Well, quoting RFC 1958:

3.2 If there are several ways of doing the same thing, choose one.
   If a previous design, in the Internet context or elsewhere, has
   successfully solved the same problem, choose the same solution unless
   there is a good technical reason not to.  Duplication of the same
   protocol functionality should be avoided as far as possible, without
   of course using this argument to reject improvements.

So, let us pick and document one. I propose #1. If its good enough for
tahoe, its good enough for us.

So, unless I hear otherwise within TWO WEEKS, this change will be made to
bis.

Because we allow INVITE without SDP.
Because its needed for many 3pcc scenarios.

In most cases recovery will work here just fine as well. The UAS (which has
presumably failed and recovered) will get the INV w/o SDP, and generate an
offer in the 2xx. In many cases this offer is a valid offer as far as the
UAC is concerned (i.e, a single audio stream), and the offer generates an
answer in the ACK.

As I said, the cases where this doesn't work are so far into corner cases it
is not worth worrying about. That in SOME cases for third party call
control, the call cannot be recovered when the UAS implements call recovery
and the UAC sends an INVITE w/o SDP - well, I think thats OK.

No one has proposed that. Everything is offer/answer. The offer/answer can
be in INV/200 or 200/ACK.

Oki.

So, if the UAS receives a re-INVITE w/o SDP, and then also receives an
ACK w/o SDP, what does it do? For the initial INVITE, it probably
releases the call, because it's a protocol error. Does the UAS do the
same here, or should it assume that the UAC SDP has not changed?

Do you know if anyone has looked into how/if this will work with with
the manyfolks resource reservation mechanism? If it does not, these 3pcc
scenarios can't use it.

Oki. Good. My missunderstanding.

Hi,

I also think it should be a MUST in the bis.

For example, the UAC may have reserved media resources for every 18x it
received, eg for early media. Then, when it receives 200 it knows that
the other branches have been terminated, so it can free those resources.
Of course it can do so even if the proxy didn't terminate the branch,
but then the servers sending early media won't start receiving ICMP for
an early session they still think is active...

I AM, however, looking forward for an SIP extension that allows one NOT
to assume that the other legs have been terminated :)

I'm fine with making it a MUST, but that does not absolve the UAC from
needing to be able to handle multiple 200s. If the proxy's CANCEL and the
second 200 cross on the wire, the proxy must still send the 200 upstream to
the UAC. The proxy is not allowed to BYE that call leg.

My apologies if this is too obvious.

I think it is a good point.

If the UAC receives a re-transmission of the ORIGINAL 200 OK, it will
resend the ACK. 

But, if it receives 200 OK for other legs I think they should be handled
like a 200 OK response to a non-existing transaction, and I guess it is
pretty much an implementation issue what to do. Some probably will
discard it, while others may ACK and BYE it.

No problem with the sentiment in the proposed text.

However, surely the text should also be linked with similar text that talks
about the use of provisional responses, with identical conditions for
support. Something along the lines of:

		Provisional responses are permitted for the INVITE method.
100 provisional responses are permitted for all methods. Provisional
responses (except 100) are not defined for other methods in this
specification. Extensions MAY define other methods for which provisional
responses are useful; those extensions should specify that provisional
responses are allowed and are mandatory if the extension method is
supported.

Hi,=0D
Is it possible to have a half duplex voice path with some hardware button
activation in Vovida stack?The reason why I am asking is because devices
like the IPAQ have a Push to Talk button and only a one directional voice
flow is possible.=0D

Very strongly do not agree. 100s are good for all sorts of
(authenticated) requests, not just INVITEs.

Doesn't this have the unfortunate side effect that the next SIP RFC will 
be dependent on some extension?  In other words, someone implementing the
SIP RFC WILL have to also implement the said extension in order to be
compliant with the RFC.

I assumed that the whole idea was for the core RFC to stand alone; 
extensions of course can refer to it and depend on the behavior specified 
in it.

I would just as soon leave it as MUST cancel in the core RFC and let caller 
prefs document over-ride this behavior for proxies that support caller 
prefs.

Doesn't the UAC always have to ACK? If the UAC ignores it, the UAS will just
keep resending it. It seems to me that the right thing to do is ACK and then
BYE.

Hello,

Well, this thread is being sidetracked...

Anyway, a second 2xx for an INVITE MUST NOT be considered "a
non-existing trasaction". It is part of the INVITE trasaction. About
discarding it, of course you MUST NOT discard it.

The UAC MUST store state for 16 seconds after the first 2xx arrives. If
during those 16 seconds another 2xx is received an ACK is sent. Then, if
the UAC wants to go on with the new call leg or if it wants to BYE it is
up to that particular UAC (and ultimately up to the user).

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hello folks,

As everybody has probably noticed, Jonathan has been sending a number of
emails to the mailing list with subjects like:

"[Sip] Open Issue #122: CANCEL on 200/600 strength"

This means that that thread is dealing with a bug that has to be fixed
in bis. Therefore, it should be top priority for the SIP WG, and thus
for the SIP mailing list. The idea is to have discussions about the bug,
reach consensus, and add or remove whatever is necessary from bis.

However, this task is very difficult if a thread has a certain subject
but deals with a related by definitively different problem. So, I would
encourage people to change the subject of the message when they are
making a related comment but they are not really discussing the main
problem. This would help distinguish discussions about bugs from
discussions about less important things and thus resolve bugs much
faster.

This is decided by the feature or application context or definition.
EX. Group pickup feature.
You want pickup a call in a pickup group, so you multicast SUBSCRIBER to the
group for the call-leg ring state.
For this case, the UAC is trying to pickup exactly one call in alert.
The UAS ringing is the only one in the pickup group who will response and
NOTIFY the UAC the ring call-leg state.
For the most of the time there is only one phone in the group ringing.
If there are more than one phones are ringing at the same time, the race
condition should be solved by some mechanism,
but the feature characteristic is only one phone.

No, I did not mean anycast, it is multicast to a group of receivers.
I think we should open the door for SIP to leverage the Multicast, not only
just for media, but also for call signaling
for the purposes of scale and simplification of PROXY and AS.

I am not so happy with this, the MUST is required so the UA only need
store state for 15.5s and the unless seems to break the intent of RFC
2119

"1. MUST   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that
the
   definition is an absolute requirement of the specification."

I realise it's really too late for caller prefs to be changed having
gone to the IESG, however, in an ideal world it would have been to
remove the cancel-feature. (If it was really useful fake it with a
hack i.e. use a new INVITE using caller prefs to avoid the UA that
returned the 200).

That said I'd be glad to be told my interpretation of RFC2119 was
incorrect.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have a question/concern in the blind transfer case.

As per the current spec,
    The TRANSFEREE responds with a Ack 202 to the REFER method, before
the attempt to the Transfer target is initiated.

    The next possible message from the Transferee to the Transferor is
NOTIFY(200 OK) and this is when the Transfer target accepts(picks up the
phone).

     In a blind transfer, where I want to release the Transferor, Ack202
"may be" premature, and NOTIFY(200 OK) may be too late.

     Can the Transferee gateway, send an intermediate NOTIFY(180 OK)
when the transfer target is "ringing". This could be a more reliable
place to release the Transferee's line, than Ack 202

Any thoughts,
Sarvi

I agree. However, it is important to see the difference between a
re-transmission of the first 200 OK, and possible 200 OK responses for
other legs that may come after, IF the UAC chooses to BYE the others.

>Then, if the UAC wants to go on with the new call leg or if it wants to BYE it is
>up to that particular UAC (and ultimately up to the user).

This confuses me a little. Now it sounds to me like it really doesn't
matter if the proxy terminates the other legs or not, because if the UAC
receives multiple 200 OK it can choose to accept or reject them just
like it wishes... :) 

IF the bis will say that the proxy MUST NOT forward more than one 200
OK, should the UAC be allowed to accept those even if that happens? One
could argue that it doesn't matter because it is a UAC implementation
issue, and I can agree on that, but the fact is that a protocol error
has occured in the network.

If only we could...

No. Non-INVITE transactions do not pend. They must
complete immediately. If you've been following the
open issues threads, you'll have seen the suggestion
to kill off provisional responses (other than a 100
Trying to quench retransmissions) to non-INVITES.

This feature of the non-INVITE transaction model is
why we have the implicit subscribe and the separate
NOTIFY instead of just waiting for the triggered
action to complete before sending the final response
to the REFER (on a historical note, that was the original
proposal of over a year ago).

That's why we have tags in the to field.

Christer, re-read this thread. We have been discussing exactly this
issue for a long time already. If proxies CANCEL pending branches, the
second 2xx will arrive at maximum 16 seconds after the first. If proxies
do not CANCEL branches, the second 2xx might arrive 3 hours later.

Regards,

Gonzalo

I was talking about CANCEL for non-INVITE, since I didn't think CANCEL
for INVITE was up for dismissal.

Good. Please stop using Windows immediately (or Linux, for that matter),
as it does not satisfy your requirements. Have you ever tried to
terminate an application with the X in the upper right hand corner and
got no reaction? Seems to happen with some frequency, at least on my W2K
box. Doesn't mean that removing the X would be desirable.

In Netscape, the ESC or Stop button don't always work, for reasons I
don't claim to understand. Should we remove the Stop button?

On Unix systems, all but the kill -9 can be ignored by applications, so
^C doesn't always work. Would you suggest getting rid of ^C?

In a car, brakes don't always work (e.g., on ice). Are you going to
remove them?

I can add lots more silly examples, if you insist :-)

Not having CANCEL means that I have no way to interrupt an
unexpectedly-non-completing transaction, since we unfortunately lack the
equivalent of kill -9 in the Internet, if you discount the various
reboot-this-server protocol extensions added as unintentional features
by certain web server designers.

In general, it is impossible to guarantee that you can stop anything
with any request as you may not be able to get the packet across. I'm
all for explicitness, i.e., an implementation should return 501 or
similar to tell you that it can't do what you asked of it. You're no
worse of than without CANCEL in that case.

I disagree. It is useful even if some servers support it, as it gives me
functionality that I wouldn't have otherwise, incomplete as it may be.
Obviously, a specification can mandate CANCEL support for a particular
method, but I don't consider myself clairvoyant enough to know whether
this is appropriate in all circumstances.

Agreed.

So I expect to see removal of the "r" row for the Authorization header from
table 4 of the bis draft, and modification of section 18.2. (wherever they
appear in the new version of the spec).

The text I proposed tries to say that 100s are allowed for all methods, and
1xx (not 100) are only allowed for INVITE or for future methods that
explicitly allow them (the reason for including this text on the CANCEL
thread is that I believe the conditions are one and the same).

I believe we are strongly agreeing.

Have you misread what I wrote, or can it be specified more clearly.

Problem: There is a lack of clarity as to which pieces of the URL should
be compared in a case-sensitive (CS) or a case-insensitive way. In
particular, there is some confusion between the BNF definition and
various statements in the text.

Proposal: In SIP URL comparison, only the user name is CS, everything
else is compared CI. The text will identify clearly where URL comparison
is needed. (Header names and values cannot appear in contexts that are
compared, so there is no need to define their CI/CSness.)

Rationale: Unfortunately, there is not much guidance in existing
protocols, as their URLs don't have nearly as many components.

CI seems to be more robust; it is difficult to explain to users that 

sip:alice@example;transport=udp
and
sip:alice@exampel;transport=UDP

mean something different.

Finally, since we'll be moving to RFC 2234 BNF notation, specifying CS
literals is very difficult:

   Section 2.3:

   Literal text strings are interpreted as a concatenated set of
   printable characters.

        NOTE:     ABNF strings are case-insensitive and
                  the character set for these strings is us-ascii.

   Hence:

        rulename = "abc"

   and:

        rulename = "aBc"

   will match "abc", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "ABc", "aBC", "AbC" and "ABC".

                To specify a rule which IS case SENSITIVE,
                   specify the characters individually.


Also, it would be helpful if we could enumerate the cases where URL
comparison is actually needed within the protocol. I suspect that many
of the corner cases don't appear. From what I can tell, we only need
this for To and From call leg matching and Contact headers for
registration matching. None of these contain, for example, headers.

Procedure: the usual drill - you have two weeks to object or discuss.

Yes. See RFC 2821 and RFC 2822. Since we want users to be able to re-use
their email address as their SIP address, this is non-negotiable.

Hi,

If everything in the SIP URL is CS, why does the user part then have to
be CS? Is there really a need for that?

Hi,

True. 

I wish we could use "this is non-negotiable" for a number of other
issues too :)

Xiaodong,

There is no direct relationship between the two.  They are very diffe=
rent
and separate protocols.  SIP handles call control and related functio=
ns
where as ENUM provides a domain name lookup based on an E.164 telepho=
ne
number.  It is very much likely that SIP and SIP Servers and UAs can =
be
enhanced by the inclusion of an ENUM Resolver.  In this case this ena=
bles
SIP to use E.164 numbers where that phone number is passed off to the=
 ENUM
resolver, which then uses the ENUM protocol to look up resource recor=
ds
(NAPTR specifically =A8C RFC 2915) that list various URLs associated =
with the
E.164 phone number.  Since any valid URL can be provisioned into the =
ENUM
registration, a SIP URL =A1=B0sip:user@host=A1=B1 can be returned.  S=
o in effect this
enables an E.164 Phone number to SIP URL translation function.

Fundamentally, ENUM is an infrastructure function that SIP can utiliz=
e to
provide services and number translation is about the most obvious.

Hope this helps=A1=AD

Rob

hi everyone:
    I am newcomer. I have a question.
    I wanna know if there is some relationship between SIP and ENUM, =
is it
possible the SIP server in the future will use ENUM resolve service?
    thanks!

If memory serves me right, the last time this was discussed we settled
on CS comparisons of more than just username. In particular, I believe
parameter names were case sensitive. This seems to be in line with HTTP
and the overall philosophy that choice is bad.

Isn't this purely an internal mechanism. If there's no externally
observable difference I don't see why the spec would bother to go into
this. A simple impl might go for #1 and a higher end UA could go for #2
and everything is just hunky dory.

At that time, we weren't thinking along RFC 2234 lines. Also, the HTTP
parameter case seems less than clear. I tried to re-locate the relevant
parts, but wasn't able to.

I'm trying to keep the rule as simple as possible.

I would agree with Rob's comments and would suggestion that you view =

Xiaodong,
=20
There is no direct relationship between the two.  They are very =
different
and separate protocols.  SIP handles call control and related functions
where as ENUM provides a domain name lookup based on an E.164 telephone
number.  It is very much likely that SIP and SIP Servers and UAs can be
enhanced by the inclusion of an ENUM Resolver.  In this case this =
enables
SIP to use E.164 numbers where that phone number is passed off to the =
ENUM
resolver, which then uses the ENUM protocol to look up resource records
(NAPTR specifically =A8C RFC 2915) that list various URLs associated =
with the
E.164 phone number.  Since any valid URL can be provisioned into the =
ENUM
registration, a SIP URL =A1=B0sip:user@host=A1=B1 can be returned.  So =
in effect
this enables an E.164 Phone number to SIP URL translation function.
=20
Fundamentally, ENUM is an infrastructure function that SIP can utilize =
to
provide services and number translation is about the most obvious.

RFC 2616 has the following section:

3.2.3 URI Comparison

   When comparing two URIs to decide if they match or not, a client
   SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire
   URIs, with these exceptions:

      - A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default
        port for that URI-reference;

        - Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;

        - Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive;

        - An empty abs_path is equivalent to an abs_path of "/".

   Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   RFC 2396 [42]) are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.

   For example, the following three URIs are equivalent:

      http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html
      http://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html
      http://ABC.com:/%7esmith/home.html

The parts defining individual parameters say whether the *value* of that
param is CS or not. My reading is that param names always are CS.

A laudable goal.

Unfortunately, the HTTP URL doesn't seem to have parameters (as in
;foo=bar).

Just to be sure we're talking about the same thing: there are two
parameters in SIP, the URL parameters (like transport and maddr) and the
header parameters (as those found in abundance in the Contact header
definition). There is no strict necessity that the two are treated the
same. It is, unfortunately, not even clear whether header parameters
(such as the 'q' parameter in HTTP) are CI or CS, although it is quite
possible that I overlooked some statement in 2616 to that effect. 

I just looked at 2617 (Basic and Digest Authentication), since it has
lots of parameters. According to Section 1.2:

   The realm directive (case-insensitive) is required for all
   authentication schemes that issue a challenge. The realm value
   (case-sensitive), ...

Thus, this is a case where the parameter name (realm, in this case) is
CI. The other parameters in 2617 don't seem to say.

However, according to the BNF,

  "literal"
      Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise,
      the text is case-insensitive.

Thus, all the others are also CI.

It would be helpful if we can get further evidence of common practice in
HTTP, SMTP or kin.

My model is somewhat different: A proxy fronts three registrars, which
back up each other, but are on a local network in close proximity to the
proxy server. In that case, packet loss is very unlikely, but
replication is very efficient and easy to implement.

That's one approach, which assumes that there is a shared traditional
database. With in-memory databases, that's not nearly as easy.

Unlike the RTCP problem, which assumes wildly popular and
start-time-synchronized multicast sessions we haven't exactly been
blessed with, power outages and synchronized restarts are at least
plausible, without changing the network.

Agreed. However, as discussed, multicast addresses a number of problems
where other solutions may not exist (DHCP) or not be equivalent. The
complexity of this feature is extremely modest, so I don't see a large
gain in removing the feature, but I am afraid of removing a useful tool.
It's a separate issue as to whether it makes sense to split this off
into a separate draft, similar to the SCTP-as-transport draft. As is,
not every registrar supports it, so this would not seem to imperil
interoperability beyond the current state.

The current text in bis-04 10.41 for the Supported header says:

   The Supported general-header field enumerates all the capabilities of
   the client or server. This header field SHOULD be included in all
   requests (except ACK) and in all responses.

There would seem to be little point in including this header in a 100 Trying
response, and as I am coming to the conclusion that this is the only header
required to appear apart from the normal mandatory ones, perhaps we should
modify this text slightly to exclude the 100 Trying response.

Does anybody see any purpose for any headers other than From; To; Call-ID;
CSeq; Via; and Content-Length within a 100 Trying response.

Yeah. Two headers: Server and Timestamp.

Server identifies the UAS (or proxy) and if the UAC included a Timestamp,
the UAS should probably echo it (I think the bis has a MUST on this).

A few comments on the drafts table available at
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/

draft-biggs-sip-replaces-01.txt has now been used in 3GPP work, and
therefore it may be appropriate to note this on the workplan table.

As it needs to be a standards track document, it would also be desirable to
know if it is to be adopted as a working group item or not. I note that it
has the charter item heading completed, but I am not sure what status this
gives the draft.

draft-ietf-sip-100rel-04 has a 3GPP dependency, but this is not noted in the
workplan table.

draft-ietf-sip-refer-01 has a 3GPP dependency, but this is not noted in the
workplan table.

draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-04 has a 3GPP dependency, but this is not noted in
the workplan table.

draft-rosenberg-sip-sctp-01 still appears in the table despite the fact that
it has been replaced by draft-ietf-sip-sctp-00 which appears separately in
the table.

I note a number of author drafts expired in August - are these to be removed
from the table, or do they remain because the author has stated that he
wishes to update them?

Note that this is only for 100 Trying.

My take on the Server and Timestamp headers was that they contain
information that needs to go from UAS to UAC, and which is irrelevant to
intervening proxies. 

As soon as I put a stateful proxy in the way, the information gets lost,
therefore there was no point in including it in the first place.

If I have no stateful proxy in the way, I am left wondering why I was using
100 Trying as a provisional response in the first place, rather than a more
appropriate provisional response (183 Session progress as the end user has
been reached) or even a final response.

Additionally 11.1.1 says "Some unspecified action is being taken on behalf
of this call (e.g., a database is being consulted), but the user has not yet
been located." so I am left wondering whether a UAS can ever generate a 100
Trying provisional response. My current conclusion is no it cannot. This
could be made clearer in the text (i.e. a UAC MUST NOT)

Therefore for the Supported header I am apparently left with requirement for
the proxy to include it in a generated response, without having the
information to include in the first place. 

Your response does tell me that the some change should also be made to the
Timestamp header text in 10.42 in order to exclude 100 Trying provisional
responses. Currently I would read this to require intervening proxies
generating the 100 Trying response to reflect any Timestamp header in the
response. Current text as follows:

"The value of the timestamp is of significance only to the client and it MAY
use any timescale. The server MUST echo the exact same value in all
provisional and final responses and MAY, if it has accurate information
about this, add a floating point number indicating the number of seconds
that have elapsed since it has received the request. "

Only a UAC can generate the server response.

In addition to the two Vijay mentioned (Server and Timestamp), I don't see
anything wrong with including Date.  Some servers, including ours, insert it
in every message generated.  (In a 100 it's probably roughly as useful as
Server, i.e. it's good for debugging and for diagnosing various abnormal
situations.)

Bis says that Record-Route headers MAY be present in a provisional response,
and doesn't separate out 100 Trying from other 1xx responses.  I can
imagine scenarios where Record-Route in a 100 could be useful, but I'm not
sure how plausible they are.

Dear I-D Editor

As part of the work of the ROHC WG, I am submitting a new ID on the compression
of SIP signaling messages, draft-heath-rohc-sip-v44-00.txt is attached.


To ROHC WG members

I apologize for the late submission of this ID on SIP Compression, I wasn't
aware of this work until a month ago.  The ID proposes to pre-load the
dictionary of the V.44 Data Compression algorithm with SIP aware information.
As you can see by the test results in the ID, this provides an excellent
candidate for the algorithm to be used for SIP compression, for compression
ratios, execution speed, ease of development, and lack of complexity.

best regards

Abstract

   This document describes a compression method based on the data
   compression algorithm described in ITU-T Recommendation V.44 [V44].
   Recommendation V.44 is a modem standard but Annex B of the 
   recommendation describes the implementation of V.44 in packet
   networks.  This document defines the application of V.44 to packets
   or messages where some or all of the contents of the data is known
   ahead of time.  For such applications the V.44 dictionary is 
   partially pre-loaded after intialization with words and/or phrases 
   that are expected to appear in the data.  This Internet Draft
   describes the mechanism of the dictionary pre-load and its 
   advantages for applications such as SIP/SDP.
 
   The V.44 algorithm is unique among data compression algorithms in

   that it combines excellent compression ratios with very fast 
   execution times and low memory requirements.  It learns and adapts
   to the input data very quickly which is one reason it provides
   superior compression ratios on relatively small blocks of data.  
   The partial pre-load of the dictionary with expected words and 
   phrases will allow even better compression ratios since it will 
   allow V.44 to encode each pre-loaded word or phrase with between
   7 to 10 bits each time it is encountered in the data. 
   
   V.44 is lossless and is based upon the LZJH data compression
   algorithm.  As described in Annex B of [V44], LZJH operates in
   packet networks using one of two methods: Packet Method where each
   individual IP packet is compressed/decompressed separately, or 
   Multi-Packet Method where several IP packets are
   compressed/decompressed as a continuation using a reliable transport.
      
   Thoughout the remainder of this document the terms V.44 and LZJH
   are synonomous.

1. Introduction

   Cellular and wireless networks are planning on implementing more
   and more Internet, IP based, services in the future.  One problem 
   with the set of IP protocols invented with the Internet in mind is
   the high overhead of additional headers and verbose data fields.
   Since bandwidth is at a premium in cellular, satellite, and other    
   

J. Heath                                                        [Page 2]

Internet Draft           SIP Compression using V.44            Sept 2001

      
   wireless networks the future implementation of these protocols
   poses a bandwidth efficiency problem.

   For example, application signaling protocols such as SIP [SIP], 
   SDP [SDP] and RTSP [RTSP] will typically be used to setup and
   control applications in a mobile Internet based on a cellular
   network. However, the generous size of the protocol messages 
   combined with their request/response nature create delays and 
   waste bandwidth in a cellular network.

   In order to reduce the delays incurred and bandwidth used by
   these protocols it is necessary to use compression techniques in
   cellular, satellite, and other wireless networks.  Some of these
   protocols contain messages that contain data that is known in 
   advance and is highly redundant.  Since the same protocols also
   have messages containing ASCII free form text, a general purpose
   data compression algorithm which can take advantage of words or
   phrases known to appear in the text is the best solution.
   
1.1 Advantages of V.44 Data Compression

   Below are some of the reasons ITU-T V.44 data compression should be 
   considered for this environment:
   
   A. The primary reason for using compression for SIP/SDP is to
      reduce the amount of data going over the RAN.  LZJH gets 
      the best compression in this environment and therefore will
      the most effective in data reduction.
      
   B. LZJH is a general purpose algorithm.  If operating in a network
      entity for one application, such as SIP/SDP, it can be used for
      other applications such as the compression of IP data packets 
      [IPCOMP] to improve the performance of the Radio Access Network.

   C. LZJH is the basis of the latest ITU-T data compression standard,
      ITU-T V.44 and will become widely used in networks.  New
      developments, such as SIP/SDP in UMTS, will benefit from using 
      the latest standarized compression technology.
      
   D. As defined in Annex B of V.44, the algorithm operates in packet
      networks on one packet at a time or on several packets using a
      reliable transport.  LZJH source code handles both methods on a
      per session basis at run time.  Thus, each network entity can
      indepedently determine, based on its resources, which method to
      use at any time.
      
   E. LZJH is superior to the other algorithms being considered for
      the SIP/SDP type application.  In this application, LZJH will get
      about twice the compression as LZW using the same MIPs and memory.  
      LZJH will get 20% to 35% better compression than LZSS while using 
      about one fifth the MIPs and similar memory.  Refer to section 4
      for algorithm comparisons.
      

J. Heath                                                        [Page 3]

Internet Draft           SIP Compression using V.44            Sept 2001
   
   
   F. LZJH was designed for packetized data.  It can get good
      compression on packets of 200 bytes and decent compression on 
      packets as small as 50 bytes.

1.2 Background of LZJH Compression

   LZJH is similar to the algorithm described in [LZ78] although is has
   aspects which are similar to the algorithm described in [LZ77].  As
   such, it provides the execution speed and low memory requirements
   of [LZ78] with compression ratios that are better than [LZ77].
   Originally developed for the satellite industry to compress IP
   datagrams independantly, it is ideal for the SIP/SDP application.
   The LZJH algorithm was modified to compress a continuous stream of
   data for a modem environment and this modified version is the basis
   for Recommendation V.44.  LZJH is an adaptive, general purpose,
   lossless data compression algorithm that provides excellent
   performance across a wide variety of data types, particularly ASCII
   text with high redundancy.  

   A typical [LZ78] compression algorithm, such as LZW, is not
   suitable for application in a packet network since it takes too long
   to build up its dictionary, resulting in poor compression ratios on
   IP datagrams that are compressed separately.  

   A typical [LZ77] compression algorithm, such as LZSS, suffers in the
   packet network application due to poor execution times.  
   
   LZJH not only has superior compression ratios when encoding or 
   decoding packetized data, but it uses little memory and provides 
   very fast execution times.  
   
   The details of LZJH compression can be found in [V44].

2. LZJH Design and Operation for SIP

   As stated earlier, LZJH operates using one of two methods in a
   packet network.  Packet Method where each IP packet, or protocol
   message, is compressed separately and the dictionaries are 
   re-initialized between messages.  Multi-Packet Method where 
   several messages are compressed and data from previous messages
   remains in the dictionary for use in compressing the current message.
   
   Multi-Packet Method requires that the messages, or packets, be
   delivered in order without any packet loss.  In other words, it
   requires a reliable transport.  The definition of that transport
   in the SIP/SDP or other similar application is beyond the scope of
   this document.
    
   Multi-Packet Method requires a separate history buffer to hold the
   data from the messages that were previouly processed.  This 
   method also requires that each separate thread or session 
   supported by a network entitiy, such as the P-CSCF, have a separate
   
   
J. Heath                                                        [Page 4]

Internet Draft           SIP Compression using V.44            Sept 2001 
   
   
   context for compression.  This context includes information for the 
   reliable link and compression dictionaries, including history buffer.
   
   In contrast, Packet Method does not require a reliable transport,
   does not require in-order delivery of messages, and does not
   require a separate history.  Packet Method is implemented in
   a serving entity, supporting hundreds of simultaneous sessions, 
   with a single instance of encoder and decoder dictionaries.  For 
   this application the total memory requirement for both encoder
   and decoder is a trivial 16K.  About 11K for the encoder, and 
   about 5K for the decoder.
   
   Multi-Packet Method provides better compression ratios than 
   Packet Method, but at the cost of considerable memory for a serving 
   network entity.  In addition, the cost of complexity and bandwidth to
   implement the underlying reliable transport may offset the better 
   compression ratios.  

2.1 LZJH Modifications for Pre-loaded Dictionaries 
   
   The modifications required to pre-load the LZJH dictionaries are
   minimal and will not affect the basic algorithm.  Thus, the same LZJH
   object module operating in a network entity will be able to operate
   normally for general purpose compression or operate using pre-loaded
   dictionaries.
   
   Currently the LZJH algorithm consists of several functions which are
   called by a user supplied control function which controls the
   operation of the algorithm.  They are:
   - initialize Packet Method
   - initialize Multi-Packet Method
   - re-initialize compressor (encoder) dictionary
   - re-initialize decompressor (decoder) dictionary
   - compress packet
   - decompress packet
     
   New functions to support the pre-load of the dictionaries have been  
   added as follows:
   - pre-load compressor dictionary
   - pre-load decompressor dictionary
   - re-initialize compressor pre-loaded dictionary
   - re-initialize decompressor pre-loaded dictionary
   
   The dictionary pre-load procedures will take as an input into the
   procedure two arrays that define the words or phrases (strings) to be
   pre-loaded.  Note that the encoder and its peer decoder must be 
   pre-loaded with exactly the same arrays for compression/decompression
   to work correctly.  The content, origin, and distribution of the 
   pre-load arrays is beyond the scope of this document and there could 
   conceivably be different pre-load arrays for each message type.
   
   The pre-load arrays consists of an array of the strings to be

   strings as follows:

   char pl_data [] = "INVITE"
                     "SIP"
                     "/2.0"

                     "Call-ID: "
                     "CSeq: ";
   
   byte pl_len [] = {6,3,4,4,5,11,6,4,9,6,0};

   The above defines 10 strings to be pre-loaded.  Note that a string
   length of zero indicates the end of the strings.  Also note this 
   mechanism is subject to change as better ideas come along.
   
   Once the encoder and decoder dictionaries are pre-loaded with a set 
   of strings, the re-initialize pre-loaded dictionary procedures will
   re-initialize only the dynamic portion of the dictionaries and
   histories, the static, pre-loaded, strings will be maintained.  Thus,
   the LZJH encoder does not have to keep compressing the same 
   pre-loaded data on each message which saves processing time.  To 
   remove the pre-loaded information, the control function uses either 
   the re-initialize compressor (or decompressor) function to clear the
   information or uses the pre-load compressor (or decompressor)
   dictionary functions to pre-load different information.
   
   It may be desireable to place a byte into the message header or as
   the first byte of compressed message data to indicate which pre-load 
   table was used by the compressor.  Alternatively, the type of 
   message, INVITE, etc., can explicitly indicate which pre-load
   table was used.
   
2.2 Operation and Performance

   During the pre-load of either the compressor (encoder) or 
   decompressor (decoder) dictionary, the information required to define 
   the strings is loaded into the dictionary structures and the strings 
   themselves are cancatenated into one array of data that occupies the 
   first N locations of the packet buffer to be processed.  Thus, the 
   data to be compressed is copied into the first location following the
   "static" data in the packet buffer prior to compression.
     
   Once pre-loaded, the dictionary can be re-initialized while
   maintaining the pre-loaded portion of the dictionary and static data,  
   a major savings in execution speed.  With LZSS, it will be necessary
   to compress the static data each time to rebuild the binary tree.

2.3 Data Integrity

   If a CRC or other such mechanism is not used by the underlying link
   layer to insure the integrity of the messages transferred over the
   RAN, then it may be necessary to prepend a 16 bit CRC or LRC to the
   compressed data to insure its integrity prior to decompression.

3. LZJH Pre-load Test Results
  
   The LZJH algorithm was modified as described in section 2 and tests
   were run on the SIP messages described in section 3.1.1 of
   <draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-05.txt> [FLOWS].
   
3.1 Test 1

   The first INVITE message and ACK message sent from User A to User
   B in section 3.1.1 of [FLOWS] are compressed separately with the LZJH
   dictionary pre-loaded with expected strings. 

   message    uncompressed bytes    compressed bytes    ratio     
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   INVITE            423                     152         2.8
   ACK               212                      88         2.4
      
   Note in section 4.1 the LZJH algorithm without a pre-load reduced
   the same INVITE message to 266 bytes.  The pre-load improved the 
   compression ratio by 75% on the INVITE.
   
   This is the compression ratio on an INVITE and ACK messages 
   compressed separately, using LZJH Packet Method, where a reliable 
   transport or any other mechanism to maintain data between messages
   is not required.  Both used the same set of pre-loaded strings.           

3.2 Test 1A

   The same INVITE message and ACK message from Test 1 are compressed
   using Multi-Packet Method where the dictionary is maintained 
   between the two messages. 

   message    uncompressed bytes    compressed bytes    ratio

3.3 Test 2

   The first INVITE message in section 3.1.1 of [FLOWS] is repeated 5 
   times with certain fields changed for each repitition, such as To URL 
   and display name, rtpmap, etc.  This is to provide a ballpark 
   comparison with the "friendly" test in section 5 of UDPCOMP SIP 
   compression [UDP].

   As can be seen, compression ratio improvements in the first 2 INVITES 
   are dramatic compared to UDPCOMP and even the last 3 INVITES are 
   better even though the INVITE messages are larger.  The total 
   compression ratio of all 5 INVITES is 6.7 compared to the total
   ratio of 2.7 (2009 / 737) for UDPCOMP, more than double.
   
   This test shows the compression ratio on a series of 5 INVITE 
   messages using LZJH Multi-Packet Method over a reliable transport.

3.4 Test 3

   Each of the 5 INVITE messages compressed in Test 2, above, is 
   compressed separately using LZJH Packet Method without a reliable
   transport or any other mechanism to maintain dictionaries between
   each message.

   message    uncompressed bytes    compressed bytes    ratio

   INVITE 4            425                     158       2.7
   INVITE 5            429                     159       2.7      
   
   The average of the 5 INVITES is a compression ratio of 2.7 which is
   exactly the same total compression ratio achieved by UDPCOMP on 5
   INVITES.  Each compressed message stands on its own and will obtain
   the same compression regardless if previous messages are received.
   
3.5 Test Conclusions

   In an enviroment where the codebook or dictionary of SIP messages
   is maintained between messages via a reliable transport or other
   mechanism, LZJH with a pre-loaded dictionary can obtain compression
   ratios that are more than double those of UDPCOMP (refer to Test 2).  
   
   In environment where each message stands on its own, LZJH with a 
   pre-loaded dictionary can reduce a SIP message by some 60% where
   UDPCOMP actually expands the first INVITE message in [UDP] section 5.
   
   SIP signalling requires the exchange of just a few messages, if it 
   takes a few messages for a complicated mechanism to obtain good 
   compression ratios over the total of all messages then any advantage 
   is negated.

Internet Draft           SIP Compression using V.44            Sept 2001 


   LZJH can obtain very good compression ratios using Multi-Packet
   Method over a reliable transport.  However, since LZJH can reduce SIP
   messages by more than half without any mechanism where the data in
   one message is used to compress following messages, the complication
   of a reliable transport or other such mechanisms may offset the extra
   savings.  Since LZJH supports both methods, it is up to network
   designers to determine which method to use on each call flow.
   
4. Algorithm Comparison

   Compression ratio comparisons between three algorithms, LZJH, LZSS,
   and LZW, are provided in this section.
   
4.1 Comparison Example 1

   The first INVITE message in section 3.1.1 of [FLOWS] is compressed
   by each algorithm without the pre-load of any algorithm.  This shows
   the raw ability of the algorithm to compress a single SIP message.
   
   algorithm    uncompressed bytes    compressed bytes     delta
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   LZJH            423                     266               -
   LZSS            423                     329              23.7%
   LZW             423                     329              23.7%
   
   In the above example, LZJH obtains a compression ratio of 1.55 on a 
   single SIP message without a pre-load of the dictionary.
   
4.2 Comparison Example 2

   The first INVITE message in section 3.1.1 of [FLOWS] is duplicated 
   into a single message and then compressed by each algorithm without 
   the pre-load of any algorithm.  This compares the ability of the 
   algorithm to compress a SIP message when the same SIP message is 
   already in the dictionary or history memory.
   
   algorithm    uncompressed bytes    compressed bytes     delta
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   LZJH            846                     273               -
   LZSS            846                     357              30.8%
   LZW             846                     536              96.3%
   
   This example shows that LZJH uses just 7 additional bytes to encode
   the entire duplicated 2nd SIP message (273 - 266 = 7).  LZSS uses
   28 additional bytes, and LZW 207 additional bytes.

4.3 Comparison Example 3

   An HTML file with significant redundancy is compressed.  This is
   to test both the compression ratio and encoder speed of each
   algorithm.  The SIP messages are too small for accurate encoder speed
   measurements.  The file is compressed as separate packets of 1500


J. Heath                                                        [Page 9]

Internet Draft           SIP Compression using V.44            Sept 2001 

   
   bytes each with compression dictionaries re-initialized between each
   packet, the compression ratio is the average for all packets.  The
   encoder time is total for all packets.
   
   Note that at this writing, the author does not have a version of
   LZSS using binary trees for speed measurement, thus, a variant of
   LZSS is used for the speed measurements, LZS which uses hash tables
   and is faster than LZSS.  Compression ratio measurements are LZSS.
   
   algorithm    encoder    uncompressed    compressed      delta
                  time        bytes          bytes

   LZS/LZSS        13         97030          42562         21.3%     
   LZW             3          97030          62586         78.4%
   
   The above example shows that both LZJH and LZW encoders are
   several times faster than that of LZSS.  Decoders are not 
   measured here, however, previous testing has shown that the
   LZJH decoder is about 3 times faster than the LZJH encoder.  The
   LZSS decoder should be as fast as the LZJH decoder and the LZW
   decoder should be slower by about a facter of 2.
   
4.4 Comparison Conclusions
   
   Among the 3 algorithms, LZJH is the obvious choice for both speed
   and compression performance.                              
   
5. Security Considerations

   There are no specific security considerations regarding the 
   proposal in this Internet Draft.  However, the application of
   data compression, as described herein, should always be done at a
   layer above any encryption, such as IPSec. 
   
6. Intellectual Property Right Considerations
   
   The LZJH data compression algorithm is referenced in one or more
   patents or patent applications.  To the extent that some of the 
   concepts in this document are adopted in a specification, Hughes 
   Network Systems agrees to license patents technically necessary to 
   implement the specification on fair, reasonable, and 
   nondiscriminatory terms.  Since HNS is a potential manufacturer of 
   3rd generation satellite terminals, this may be based on 
   reciprocity where possible.

Hi guys,

I had initially sent out a question on this issue and received no
responses; so I'm trying again... :^)

I'm trying to understand the appropriate translation of ANI II digits to
their SIP equivalent.  However, when
I try to match the currently defined ANI II digits from
http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/ani_ii_assignments.html
against the keywords defined in
Appendix A of draft-ietf-sip-privacy-02.txt, it appears to be a sparse,
non-invertible mapping.

So, I have a few questions:
1) Is there a more recent version of this syntax?
2) Could someone define a less sparse, invertible mapping as a best
current practice?
3) Should we instead just define a new tag such as, ";ani-ii=number" ?
4) Other ideas?

Here's the sparse, non-invertible mapping that I came up with:

ordinary                  00
residential
business
priority
hotel                     06
failure                   02
hospital
prison                    29
police
test
payphone                  70
coin                      27
payphone-public
payphone-private
coinless
restrict
coin-restrict
coinless-restrict
reserved                  80-89
operator                  34, 07?
trans-freephone
isdn-res
isdn-bus
unknown
emergency


I was specifically unable to identify a mapping for the following ANI II
digits:
01, 20, 23, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32, 52, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 80-89, 93


Here's the lists of digits as defined by www.nanpa.com:

                 routes the call to a CAMA or Operator
                 Services System, the calling number may be
                 verbally obtained and manually recorded. If
                 manual operator identification is not available,
                 the receiving switching system (e.g., an
                 interLATA carrier without operator capabilities)
                 may reject the call.
    03-05  Unassigned
    06         Station Level Rating - The "06" digit pair is
                 used when the customer has subscribed to a
                 class of service in order to be provided with
                 real time billing information. For example,
                 hotel/motels, served by PBXs, receive detailed
                 billing information, including the calling party?s
                 room number. When the originating switching
                 system does not receive the detailed billing
                 information, e.g., room number, this "06" code
                 allows the call to be routed to an operator or
                 operator services system to obtain complete
                 billing information. The rating and/or billing
                 information is then provided to the service
                 subscriber. This code is used only when the
                 directory number (DN) is not accompanied by
                 an automatic room/account identification.
    07          Special Operator Handling Required - calls
                 generated from stations that require further
                 operator or Operator Services System
                 screening are accompanied by the "07" code.
                 The code is used to route the call to an
                 operator or Operator Services System for
                 further screening and to determine if the station
                 has a denied-originating class of service or
                 special routing/billing procedures. If the call is
                 unauthorized, the calling party will be routed to
                 a standard intercept message.
    08-09   Unassigned
    10         Not assignable - conflict with 10X test code
    11         Unassigned
    12-19   Not assignable - conflict with international
                 outpulsing code
    20         Automatic Identified Outward Dialing (AIOD) -
                 without AIOD, the billing number for a PBX is
                 the same as the PBX Directory Number (DN).
                 With the AIOD feature, the originating line
                 number within the PBX is provided for charging
                 purposes. If the AIOD number is available
                 when ANI is transmitted, code "00" is sent. If
                 not, the PBX DN is sent with ANI code "20". In
                 either case, the AIOD number is included in
                 the AMA record.
    21-22   Unassigned
    23          Coin or Non-Coin - on calls using database
                 access, e.g., 800, ANI II 23 is used to indicate
                 that the coin/non-coin status of the originating
                 line cannot be positively distinguished for ANI
                 purposes by the SSP. The ANI II pair 23 is
                 substituted for the II pairs which would
                 otherwise indicate that the non-coin status is
                 known, i.e., 00, or when there is ANI failure.

                 ANI II 23 may be substituted for a valid 2-digit
                 ANI pair on 0-800 calls. In all other cases, ANI
                 II 23 should not be substituted for a valid
                 2-digit ANI II pair which is forward to an SSP
                 from an EAEO.

                 Some of the situations in which the ANI II 23
                 may be sent:

                       Calls from non-conforming end offices
                       (CAMA or LAMA types) with combined
                       coin/non-coin trunk groups.
                       0-800 Calls
                       Type 1 Cellular Calls
                       Calls from PBX Trunks
                       Calls from Centrex Tie Lines
    24         Code 24 identifies a toll free service call that
                 has been translated to a Plain Old Telephone
                 Service (POTS) routable number via the toll
                 free database that originated for any non-pay
                 station. If the received toll free number is not
                 converted to a POTS number, the database
                 returns the received ANI code along with the
                 received toll free number. Thus, Code 24
                 indicates that this is a toll free service call
                 since that fact can no longer be recognized
                 simply by examining the called address.
    25         Code 25 identifies a toll free service call that
                 has been translated to a Plain Old Telephone
                 Service (POTS) routable number via the toll
                 free database that originated from any pay
                 station, including inmate telephone service.
                 Specifically, ANI II digits 27, 29, and 70 will be
                 replaced with Code 25 under the above stated
                 condition.
    26         Unassigned
    27         Code 27 identifies a line connected to a pay
                 station which uses network provided coin
                 control signaling. II 27 is used to identify this
                 type of pay station line irrespective of whether
                 the pay station is provided by a LEC or a
                 non-LEC. II 27 is transmitted from the
                 originating end office on all calls made from
                 these lines.
    28         Unassigned
    29         Prison/Inmate Service - the ANI II digit pair 29
                 is used to designate lines within a
                 confinement/detention facility that are intended
                 for inmate/detainee use and require outward
                 call screening and restriction (e.g., 0+ collect
                 only service). A confinement/detention facility
                 may be defined as including, but not limited to,
                 Federal, State and/or Local prisons, juvenile
                 facilities, immigration and naturalization
                 confinement/detention facilities, etc., which are
                 under the administration of Federal, State, City,
                 County, or other Governmental agencies.
                 Prison/Inmate Service lines will be identified by
                 the customer requesting such call screening
                 and restriction. In those cases where private
                 paystations are located in
                 confinement/detention facilities, and the same
                 call restrictions applicable to Prison/Inmate
                 Service required, the ANI II digit for
                 Prison/Inmate Service will apply if the line is
                 identified for Prison/Inmate Service by the
                 customer.
    30-32   Intercept - where the capability is provide to
                 route intercept calls (either directly or after an
                 announcement recycle) to an access tandem
                 with an associated Telco Operator Services
                 System, the following ANI codes should be
                 used:

                       30 Intercept (blank) - for calls to
                       unassigned directory number (DN)
                       31 Intercept (trouble) - for calls to
                       directory numbers (DN) that have been
                       manually placed in trouble-busy state
                       by Telco personnel
                       32 Intercept (regular) - for calls to
                       recently changed or disconnected
                       numbers
    33        Unassigned
    34         Telco Operator Handled Call - after the Telco
                 Operator Services System has handled a call
                 for an IC, it may change the standard ANI digits
                 to "34", before outpulsing the sequence to the
                 IC, when the Telco performs all call handling
                 functions, e.g., billing. The code tells the IC that
                 the BOC has performed billing on the call and
                 the IC only has to complete the call.
    35-39   Unassigned
    40-49  Unrestricted Use - locally determined by
                 carrier
    50-51   Unassigned
    52         Outward Wide Area Telecommunications
                 Service (OUTWATS) - this service allows
                 customers to make calls to a certain zone(s) or
                 band(s) on a direct dialed basis for a flat
                 monthly charge or for a charge based on
                 accumulated usage. OUTWATS lines can dial
                 station-to-station calls directly to points within
                 the selected band(s) or zone(s). The LEC
                 performs a screening function to determine the
                 correct charging and routing for OUTWATS
                 calls based on the customer?s class of service
                 and the service area of the call party. When
                 these calls are routed to the interexchange
                 carrier via a combined WATS-POTS trunk
                 group, it is necessary to identify the WATS
                 calls with the ANI code "52".
    53-59   Unassigned
    60         TRS - ANI II digit pair 60 indicates that the
                 associated call is a TRS call delivered to a
                 transport carrier from a TRS Provider and that
                 the call originated from an unrestricted line (i.e.,
                 a line for which there are no billing restrictions).
                 Accordingly, if no request for alternate billing is
                 made, the call will be billed to the calling line.
    61         Cellular/Wireless PCS (Type 1) - The "61" digit
                 pair is to be forwarded to the interexchange
                 carrier by the local exchange carrier for traffic
                 originating from a cellular/wireless PCS carrier
                 over type 1 trunks. (Note: ANI information
                 accompanying digit pair "61" identifies only the
                 originating cellular/wireless PCS system, not
                 the mobile directory placing the call.
    62         Cellular/Wireless PCS (Type 2) - The "62" digit
                 pair is to be forwarded to the interexchange
                 carrier by the cellular/wireless PCS carrier
                 when routing traffic over type 2 trunks through
                 the local exchange carrier access tandem for
                 delivery to the interexchange carrier. (Note:
                 ANI information accompanying digit pair "62"
                 identifies the mobile directory number placing
                 the call but does not necessarily identify the
                 true call point of origin.)
    63         Cellular/Wireless PCS (Roaming) - The "63"
                 digit pair is to be forwarded to the
                 interexchange carrier by the cellular/wireless
                 PCS subscriber "roaming" in another
                 cellular/wireless PCS network, over type 2
                 trunks through the local exchange carrier
                 access tandem for delivery to the
                 interexchange carrier. (Note: Use of "63"
                 signifies that the "called number" is used only
                 for network routing and should not be disclosed
                 to the cellular/wireless PCS subscriber. Also,
                 ANI information accompanying digit pair "63"
                 identifies the mobile directory number
                 forwarding the call but does not necessarily
                 identify the true forwarded-call point of origin.)
    64-65  Unassigned
    66         TRS - ANI II digit pair 66 indicates that the
                 associated call is a TRS call delivered to a
                 transport carrier from a TRS Provider, and that
                 the call originates from a hotel/motel. The
                 transport carrier can use this indication, along
                 with other information (e.g., whether the call
                 was dialed 1+ or 0+) to determine the
                 appropriate billing arrangement (i.e., bill to room
                 or alternate bill).
    67         TRS - ANI II digit pair 67 indicates that the
                 associated call is a TRS call delivered to a
                 transport carrier from a TRS Provider and that
                 the call originated from a restricted line.
                 Accordingly, sent paid calls should not be
                 allowed and additional screening, if available,
                 should be performed to determine the specific
                 restrictions and type of alternate billing
                 permitted.
    68-69  Unassigned
    70         Code 70 identifies a line connected to a pay
                 station (including both coin and coinless
                 stations) which does not use network provided
                 coin control signaling. II 70 is used to identify
                 this type pay station line irrespective of
                 whether the pay station is provided by a LEC
                 or a non-LEC. II 70 is transmitted from the
                 originating end office on all calls made from
                 these lines.
    71-79  Unassigned
    80-89   Reserved for Future Expansion "to" 3-digit
                 Code
    90-92  Unassigned
    93         Access for private virtual network types of
                 service: the ANI code "93" indicates, to the IC,
                 that the originating call is a private virtual
                 network type of service call.
    94         Unassigned
    95         Unassigned - conflict with Test Codes 958 and
                 959
    96-99  Unassigned

Bryan,

It is not mean to be an invertible 1 to 1 mapping - if that is what is
needed, then you must use SIP-T.  The rationale behind the mapping was to
cover the most common and most likely to be used in IP service logic in PSTN
to SIP calling.

However, I thought they matched up better than you have listed.  I'll take a
look and maybe we can add/modify a few.

I doubt we need a BCP - if it is not almost obvious what the mapping is,
then we have not defined it correctly.

Thanks,
Alan Johnston

<< Hi guys,
 
 I had initially sent out a question on this issue and received no
 responses; so I'm trying again... :^)
 
 I'm trying to understand the appropriate translation of ANI II digits to
 their SIP equivalent.  However, when
 I try to match the currently defined ANI II digits from
 http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/ani_ii_assignments.html
 against the keywords defined in
 Appendix A of draft-ietf-sip-privacy-02.txt, it appears to be a sparse,
 non-invertible mapping.
 
 So, I have a few questions:
 1) Is there a more recent version of this syntax?
 2) Could someone define a less sparse, invertible mapping as a best
 current practice?
 3) Should we instead just define a new tag such as, ";ani-ii=number" ?
 4) Other ideas? >>

<<My comment:
It seems best to use your suggestion 3 - simply define a tag for 
"ani-ii=number" and use the currently defined numbers, not some newly 
invented list of keywords that have unknown meanings. Let's not reinvent the 
wheel!

Mike Pierce

Hi all,

I had earlier proposed a mechanism for third party
call control. Here are some more analytical details on it:

http://www22.brinkster.com/mbhatia/draft-bhatia-3pcc-refer-00.txt

Some simple advantages of the technique against the one specified in
Rosenberg/Peterson/Schulzrinne/Camarillo draft:

- Controller has the option of acting as a proxy or a back
to back user agent for the duration of the call after the REFER.

- Controller does no have to manipulate any SDP, unless the
application desires it.

- Does not rely on the usage of INVITE without SDP (a large number
of proxies and UAs have trouble handling it).

- Does not require putting A or B on hold, which generally causes the=20
UA to put the peer back on hold.

- Does not suffer from any potential timeout issues, or assume any
special behavior of the clients (some controllers use "flow 1" in the
sip-3pcc draft, which works best when B is some kind of automatic
device, like a media server).

- Cannot cause an "infinite loop" of INVITEs (Some controllers tend to
use the "flow 2" in the sip-3pcc draft, which suffers from this
problem).=20

The approach does use the SIP REFER method and the Replaces header:


        A               Controller             B
        |                   |                  |
        |             create callid1           |
        |   REFER callid1   |                  |

        |------------------>|                  |

        |                   |    ACK           |
        |                   |----------------->|
        |                   |                  |

In this scenario, the controller has no ongoing calls with A and B
in the beginning. It creates a local context for callid1. This context
MUST contain a SIP call id, and MAY contain from and to tags locally
generated at the controller. At this point the controller sends a REFER
with the Replaces callid1 header to A. If A is interested in the call,=20
it sends a 202 Accepted back to the controller. At this point the=20
controller starts a timer, "timer-callid1", on callid1 for TC seconds.
(TC is an application specific timer, which should at least take into
account the retransmissions from A. ~10*T2 seconds is probably a good
value).
When the INVITE arrives from A with the Replaces callid1 header, the
timer is cancelled, the INVITE is forwarded to B. At this point the=20
controller may act as a Back to Back user agent or a proxy for the
call duration, depending on the kind of application running on the
controller. The 200 OK from B arrives and is forwared to A. This way
the controller does not need to assume anything about what SDP will
be used for the call.

1. Controller creates SIP call leg 1 (Call id=3D12345%40192.168.118.3;
              to-tag=3D12345;from-tag=3D5FFE-3994), and sends a REFER to =
A:
         =20
        REFER sip:A@agentland SIP/2.0
        Via: SIP/2.0/UDP controller.nextone.net
        To: <sip:A@agentland>
        From: <sip:B@controller.nextone.net>;tag=3D193402342
        Call-ID: 898234234@controller.nextone.net
        CSeq: 93809823 REFER
        Refer-To: =
<sip:B@controller@nextone.net?Replaces:12345%40192.168.118.3;
                   to-tag=3D12345;from-tag=3D5FFE-3994>
        Referred-By: <sip:B@controller.nextone.net>
        Contact: sip:B@controller.nextone.net
        Content-Length: 0

     Note the presence of the To tag, even though the INVITE is
     being sent by A. The Controller may or may not put the To tag.

     2. B sends a 202 Accepted to the Controller.
    =20
     3. B sends an INVITE to the Controller

        INVITE =
<sip:B@controller@nextone.net?Replaces:12345%40192.168.118.3;
                   to-tag=3D12345;from-tag=3D5FFE-3994> SIP/2.0
        Via:     SIP/2.0/UDP sip:A@agentland
        From:    A <sip:A@agentland>;tag=3D3pcc
        To:      B <B@controller@nextone.net>
        Call-ID: 31415@agentland
        CSeq:    1 INVITE
        Contact: A@agentland

MID-call:

The same mechanism can be used in the middle of a call. This is the
scenario when the controller already has a call up with A. The only
change in this case is that the REFER is sent on the existing call leg.
The call flows in this case are similar to the call transfer call
flows given the sip-call-transfer draft. In this case A sends a NOTIFY

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>I had earlier proposed a mechanism =

size=3D2>Rosenberg/Peterson/Schulzrinne/Camarillo=20
draft:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>- Controller has the option of acting =
as a proxy=20
or a back<BR>to back user agent for the duration of the call after the=20
REFER.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>- Controller does no have to =
manipulate any SDP,=20
unless the<BR>application desires it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>- Does not rely on the usage of =
INVITE without=20
SDP (a large number<BR>of proxies and UAs have trouble handling=20
it).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>- Does not require putting A or B on =
hold, which=20
generally causes the <BR>UA to put the peer back on hold.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>- Does not suffer from any potential =
timeout=20
issues, or assume any<BR>special behavior of the clients (some =
controllers use=20
"flow 1" in the<BR>sip-3pcc draft, which works best when B is some kind =

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DCourier size=3D2>- Cannot cause an "infinite loop" of =
