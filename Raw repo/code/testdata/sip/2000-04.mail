Since conversion of a document of that size takes some of (my) time, it
will happen when it is submitted as an Internet draft in a week or two.
Your patience is appreciated.

Is this a practical problem? How many proxy servers that implement
Route/Record-Route couldn't be trained to do that? Also, I believe this
has been discussed since the first bake-off or thereabouts, so most
implementors should have seen this.

One solution is to define a status code in 4xx (or maybe 3xx) that says
"modification failed, call remains".

I suppose other 4xx conditions could suddenly arise (for example, I
somehow turn on authentication in mid-call), but these seem somewhat
unlikely. 

I'm curious how RSVP deals with this, since it also has the problem that
state may be modified during a reservation.

Any updates on your communication with the RFC 2617 authors regarding the
use of qoutes with Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers?

Thanks.

SIP messages can contain any URI wherever a SIP URL can appear. WHilst
its not forbidden to put an http URL or a URN in the to and from field
(and things will still work, but it might not get routed too far), I'm
not sure why you'd want to do that. We have generally discussed using
tel URLs in these places, in addition to SIP URLs. 

I'm curious where you found these messages?

We can take a poll at the bakeoff, but I'm sure there are
implementations that won't be there...

Actually, to be consistent with a regular INVITE, it would need to be a
2xx that says "modification failed, call remains", since a 200 OK to
initial INVITE means the call is up.

I'm not sure we want to do this, though. I think we are pretty far down
the road of re-INVITE being different from INVITE.

This issue isn't really specific to INFO. In general, the question is
whether you can send a request immediately after sending an INVITE, and
can the UAS send a request in the reverse direction after receiving the
INVITE?

We discussed this issue as it relates to BYE. I believe the issues here
are similar. If the UAC waits for a provisional or final response, it
will have both a Route and a tag, and can thus insure that the request
gets to the right place. If the UAC sends a request out before waiting
for that response with the tag and route, it might work, but it becomes
dependent on the consistency of call processing logic at intermediate
proxies. 

The issue is similar for the called party. If it sends the request
before the caller gets a provisional or final response to the initial
INVITE with a tag, the caller won't know from whom the new request is.
So, its a good idea for the called party to wait for an ACK before
sending a new request, but its not mandatory.

Do you have a specific need for sending INFO right away? Remember, INFO
cannot be used to modify session or call state.

Regarding your second question, sure. No m lines in the SDP.

I suggest we take a poll at the next bakeoff and see what folks have
implemented. If everyone is using quotes, we can go with that...

A simple question on the proxy behavior. How the proxy 
(or the UAC) gets the Request-URI for the INVITE message 
to be sent out?
When the proxy server receives an INVITE, it consults the 
location server to decide where to proxy this request. 
Should the proxy server use the Request-URI (or part of it), 
or should it use the To header to query the location server to 
identify the next hop? If it uses the Rquest-URI, the host portion 
of the Request-URI should mostly be one of the host names on 
the proxy itself. If the proxy uses the To field, possibly the 
Request-URI has already been changed to be quite different from 
To. Then he To doesn't make sense here. Or should it be that 
the proxy first check againt the Request-URI to see if it knows the 
user. If not, resort to the "To" field?

Should section 4.3 in bis be interpreted in this way? If there's
a section in the bis that describes this issue, please give me
a pointer. Thanks...

Yes, the request URI is what a proxy or redirect server should generally
use in order to determine the next hop.

Except for the case of a local proxy, in which case the host name in the
request URI is not one of the host names of the proxy itself. In this
case, a proxy should generally forward it to the address in the request
URI.


 If the proxy uses the To field, possibly the

A proxy will not generally need to look at the To field for general
message routing.

Say if the Request-URI is somebody@foo.com and foo.com is one of the 
host names of the receiving proxy itself. So the proxy now takes 
"somebody" to do the lookup, as the foo.com does not give any information
about the destination the INVITE should be going, though in the To
header is actually "somebody@BellCanada.com", which is the destination.
But "somebody" is not unique without the host name and may not tell much 
about where he is. I missed something here?

As I said, the To field is not used by the proxy. BellCanada.com is not
the domain of the proxy; it cannot know anything about this name space,
and therefore is not in a position to know anything about
somebody@bellcanada.com.

The proxy uses the request URI. If you are saying that the problem is
that "somebody@foo.com" is not unique within foo.com (in otherwords,
there are two somebodys), you have mismanaged your own namespace.

Thanks for pointing/confirming about the unique name space. Then if
there is a "somebody@mciworldcom.com" and a "somebody@bellcanada.com",
the proxy server needs to configure two names as somebody1@foo.com and
somebody2@foo.com to send the call to different called destinations? So
the proxy server should not serve too many different destination domains
as this would make the name management impossible to give them all different
names in the proxy's domain. Is this right?

This question is regarding section 12.3.4 of 2543 (and 2543bis).
If the answer is in the mailing list archives, or the notes file,
or the faq, I've missed it.

If a forking proxy receives an INVITE request, and generates two
INVITES from it, according to 12.4 the only difference between them
is the branch=x in the via header (and probably the Request-URI too)

If it happens that both of those forked requests are sent to the same
stateful proxy as the next hop, how does that proxy know that
the second isn't a retransmission?  To, From (including tags),
Call-ID, and CSeq are all identical.

Adding a tag on the From header at the forking proxy would seem to
be a bad idea, since then the response wouldn't match at the UAC.
Also, there may already be a tag on the From header.

Does this mean the stateful proxy needs to compare Via headers
also, in determining whether the received request is a retransmission?
Or, should it compare the Request-URI?
Is there some other way it can tell that the second is a real request?

Bill, I think you are referring to the problem of request merging in a 
forking proxy - refer to Jonathan's page - he has a small article and 
possible solutions.

You've lost me. If I call somebody@mciworldcom.com and
somebody@bellcanada.com, those will go to two different proxies (or
possibly the same proxy doing virtual hosting). If those map to
different people, then the outgoing URIs will be different.

No, of course not. Why is this a problem? The proxy is serving many
domains, as you say. To me, this means it handles requests for
domain1.com, domain2.com, etc. You also seem to imply that these are
mapped into a single namespace in the "proxy's domain". I don't follow
that. If it receives a call for user1@domain1.com, it checks its tables
for domain1.com, and finds that this is mapped to user_1@foo.com, and
sends it out to foo.com. Not all incoming request get mapped to foo.com.
For those that do, its up to foo.com to properly manage their namespace.

SIP messages can contain any URI wherever a SIP URL can appear. WHilst
its not forbidden to put an http URL or a URN in the to and from field
(and things will still work, but it might not get routed too far), I'm
not sure why you'd want to do that. We have generally discussed using
tel URLs in these places, in addition to SIP URLs.

I'm curious where you found these messages?

Right, I think I actually constructed this example.

Its purpose is mainly to test parser and proxy robustness. A proxy which
receives an INVITE with a request URI that has a scheme it doesn't
understand, can't really route it, so it should probably send a 404.
Having these funky URLs in Contact is much more likely.

As voice, video, and data continue to converge, policy-based networking
allows administrators to easily manage network traffic - dynamically
prioritizing the delivery of time-critical and bandwidth-intensive traffic.

IPHighway has just released a new series of white papers that highlight the
promise of policy-based network management, and how it can improve Quality
of Service (QoS) to better support next-generation, business-critical
applications.

The series includes 4 targeted documents, they offer a comprehensive
overview of policy-based networking and its possibilities:

*	#1 - Introduction to Policy Based Networking & QoS
(509KB) 
*	#2 - Policy Standards & IETF Terminology
(484KB) 
*	#3 - Policy-based Networking Products, Design & Architecture
(535KB) 
*	#4 - IPHighway Target Markets & Case Studies
(1,159KB)

I see the problem I have is thst from all the call flow examples in the
call flow draft, the INVITE message always have user@proxydomain in the
Request-URI and the Request-URI changes all the time from proxy to proxy.
For example, if the INVITE goes through proxy ss1.mciworld.com and
ss2.mciworld.com. The Request-URI in the INVITE message is shown as
bigguy@ss1.mciworldcom.com and then changed to bigguy@ss2.mciworldcom.com.
Should the caller UAC just send in Request-URI bigguy@mciworldcom.com to
SS1 proxy. The SS1 does a look up and know that SS2 handles
bigguy@mciworldcom.com
and proxy it to SS2? Otherwise, as in the draft, it implies to me
that everyone in the mciworld.com also should have a unique name in the
ss1.mciworldcom.com so that SS1 can handle it.
That leads me to think that when an INVITE is sent to a proxy, it should use
the proxy's host name in the host part of the Request-URI. But as what you
pointed out here, really  the Request-URI should be the destination
user@host
and is sent to the proxy of the destination domain.
Thanks for your help. Very much apprecaited.

Found that article, but I think the problem I'm describing is a little
different.  Jonathan's diagram is:


                            ----
                       /---| B  |-\
                      /     ----   \
     ----       ---- /              \  ----         ----       ----
    | C1 |-----| A  |                -|  D |-------| E  |-----| C2 |
     ----       ---- \              /  ----         ----       ----
                      \     ----   /
                       \---| C  |-/
                            ----

and the key item is that both forked requests are to go to C2.

I would instead draw the diagram as:

                            ----                  ----
                       /---| B  |-\           /--| C2 |
                      /     ----   \         /    ----
     ----       ---- /              \  ---- / 
    | C1 |-----| A  |                -|  D |
     ----       ---- \              /  ---- \
                      \     ----   /         \    ----
                       \---| C  |-/           \--| C3 |
                            ----                  ----
where the key item is that the two forked requests from A are intended
to get to different endpoints; they just happen to cross at another
proxy on the way.  (Or, perhaps the translation done at A says the next
proxy for both C2 and C3 is D; then we avoid B and C completely.)

Jonathan's mechanisms to toss the secondary requests believing them
to be duplicates isn't right for this case.

I think the problem still is that proxy-D believes the second request it
receives is a duplicate, even if the Request-URI for the first
says C2 and the second says C3.

Bill, I think you are referring to the problem of request merging in a 
forking proxy - refer to Jonathan's page - he has a small article and 
possible solutions.

Li,

I thought your question might have been based on the use of Request-URI in the
Call Flows draft.

I think the Request-URIs in the draft were formulated based on the (mistaken?)
idea that the host portion of the Request-URI should map to the IP address of
the proxy or server (the entity to which the request was sent).

For example, in 3.1.2 on page 25 of draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt, message F4
has the INVITE Request-URI of UserB@ss1.wcom.com but the To header contains
UserB@there.com where ss1.wcom.com is the Proxy Server.  

Should the Request-URI instead match the To header in this case?

Always have the host portion of the Request-URI mapped to the
IP address of the proxy or server may have a problem when there is
a local proxy that handles many (or all) outgoing calls for a caller.
Put Request-URI as UserB@wcom.com in this example may be better,
my own take. Clearer to me. If proxy ss1 only handles calls to users
in wcom.com, things may not be too bad if the INVITE message has
Request-URI with ss1.wcom.com in the host portion. But say if the caller
also wants to call somebody outside of wcom.com but should access through
the
wcom's ss1 proxy for all his services. If in this case the caller UAC gets
all the destinations in the world mapped to a unique name@ss1.wcom.com
in the Request-URI in the INVITE message, we'd have problems of too many
mappings to handle for ss1.wcom.com. Of course, probably user A can send his
different calls directly to different proxy servers of the destination
carrier's
network, which I don't know if it is the case.

Li Li,

Just to be clear, it is certainly legal for the request uri received at a
proxy to contain a host portion that does not point to the proxy. 

For instance, it is perfectly valid for a customer using an MCI Worldcom
proxy with a host name of sip.wcom.com to call someone with a request uri of
sip:lili@ss8networks.com.  

Thus, if I wanted to call you, using my proxy server for the first hop
(maybe because that is the only way I can get the call to go through the MCI
Worldcom firewall) I can send the following INVITE request to my proxy.
Note that my user agent may be configured to send all requests to the
sip.wcom.com proxy, or I may on a call-by-call basis decide where to send
the request.

Calling UA       --------------------->  Proxy
srd@srd.wcom.com                         sip.wcom.com

INVITE sip:lili@ss8networks.com SIP/2.0
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP srd.wcom.com
From: sip:srd@srd.wcom.com
To: sip:lili@ss8networks.com
callid: 1234@srd.wcom.com
Cseq: 1 INVITE

In this case the proxy is providing the service to the calling user.  If the
proxy doesn't know anything about lili@ss8networks.com then it would proxy
the request to the ss8networks.com host, in this case assumed to be a proxy,
but it could be your end device.

Proxy            --------------------->  Proxy
sip.wcom.com                             ss8networks.com

INVITE sip:lili@ss8networks.com SIP/2.0
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP sip.wcom.com;branch=xyz
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP srd.wcom.com
From: sip:srd@srd.wcom.com
To: sip:lili@ss8networks.com
callid: 1234@srd.wcom.com
Cseq: 1 INVITE

Note that the request uri doesn't change, just the destination for the
message.

It is also possible that the proxy is also providing a service to the called
user, in which case it may change the request uri before sending it to the
next hop.

It would probably be helpful to add a scenario like this to the call flow
document.

Bill,

The proxy needs to use the request URI to differentiate between requests
received.  Consider the following scenario discussed earlier on the list:

     C1--->A--->B--->C--->A--->C2

This is a "legal" request loop when the same request (as defined by to,
from, callid and cseq) gets to A the second time with a different request
uri.  As such, it should not be dropped or rejected as a via loop.

Note that in this scenario, proxy A needs to use the branch tag in the first
Via it adds to the request to point to (or contain) the original request
uri.  If the request uri indicated in the branch tag is the same as the
request uri in the request the second time the request is received by A,
then it is a via loop.  If not, then it is a legal loop.

I'm sorry if the wording is a little convoluted, I'm still a little sleep
deprived from flying over the pacific ocean...

Steve

Steve,

Thanks for the response.

I had thought loop detection was a completely separable issue.  It
obviously isn't.

From your response, I take it the proxy needs to use the Request-URI
as part of the loop detection, and somehow encodes the Request-URI
into the 'x' of branch=x in the via header.

Does that also imply the proxy needs to use the Request-URI for
retransmission detection as well?  So that it compares From, To, Call-ID,
CSeq, and Request-URI to determine whether the received request is
a retransmission of a previous request?

It seems it would have to; otherwise proxy A in your example would
consider the second request it received (the one with the modified
Request-URI) a retransmission of the initial request from C1, 
and ignore it.

At the Adelaide meeting, I believe there was general consensus on the
method described in draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-00 for qos and
security preconditions.

Two remaining issues were identified
  (1) the method needs a new name
  (2) whether the UAS can specify preconditions if the UAC doesn't

PRECONDITION-MET is clearly a bad choice of a method name.  However
with one vote each for PRE-INFO, ASSERT, CONFIRM, QUACK, PROGRESS,
ADMITTED, PRDONE, PRMET, PREMET, and PREDONE, there was clearly
no consensus among the authors.  Plenty of nominations.  Need votes.

If the UAC does not put a precondition line into the SDP, and the UAS
does, the main question is how the UAS knows that it will be honored.
(If it inserts the line and doesn't ask for a confirmation, then it 
clearly won't know if it is honored or not.  sharp stick.)

If the UAC supports reliable provisional responses, then the UAS can
ask for a PRACK, and get a PRACK with SDP with a precondition line.
UAS then knows to expect a FOOBAR message (or whatever it gets called).

If the UAC doesn't include an SDP with the PRACK, or includes an SDP
without the precondition line, then the UAS knows to not expect a FOOBAR.

So the case left open is if there is no support indicated for 100rel.
I'd consider that to mean no support for preconditions either.

Comments?

Always ready with an opinion, while QUACK is a winner name :),
I'll vote for PRMET.  I think your suggestion that 100rel support
is required for UAS asserting PRMET is just fine.

Bill,

Yes, you are correct, the proxy needs to use the request uri to determine
retransmissions as well.  And yes, the proxy needs to be able to determine
the original request uri based on the content of the branch tag.

Why is that? At least it reflects what's going on...

Yes, or we could use Supported to make it more explicit.

Hi,
The bis draft (latest copy)  does suggest that while generating branch-ids
one should use a crypto hash of to,from,callid,cseq &Request-URI suggesting
MD5 as an algorithm.

Infact section 12.3.1 mentions the use of branch in loop detection

"A request has been looped if the server finds its own address in the Via
header field and the hash computation over
the fields enumerated in Section 6.45.5 yields the same value as the

--0__=S9f5gn3833EEW5G4PEyguhHF5j6Yun3GPS49G4pMQGhlXWW1dAk4CxIv
Content-type: text/plain; charset=windows-1257
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable


=93branch=94 parameter in the Via entry
containing the proxy server=92s address.
The To, From, Call-ID,andContact tags are copied exactly from the origi=
nal
request. The proxy
SHOULD change the Request-URI to indicate the server where it intends t=
o
send the request.
A proxy server always inserts a Via header field containing its own add=
ress
 into those requests that are
caused by an incoming request. Each proxy MUST insert a =93branch=94 pa=
rameter
(Section 6.45). "


However, 12.3,4 does not mention veryfying from the branch id for a
retransmission. Should ths not be added ?

Steve,

Thanks for the response.

I had thought loop detection was a completely separable issue.  It
obviously isn't.

From your response, I take it the proxy needs to use the Request-URI
as part of the loop detection, and somehow encodes the Request-URI
into the 'x' of branch=x in the via header.

Does that also imply the proxy needs to use the Request-URI for
retransmission detection as well?  So that it compares From, To, Call-ID,
CSeq, and Request-URI to determine whether the received request is
a retransmission of a previous request?

It seems it would have to; otherwise proxy A in your example would
consider the second request it received (the one with the modified
Request-URI) a retransmission of the initial request from C1,
and ignore it.

We have identified in another SIP WG draft "QoS Assured" which
is basically the same as discussed here, and "QoS Enabled". Am
wondering if we should not have some foresight and chose a
naming system that will make sense later on.

Fully agree with what you've explained. Adding a
different scenario to the flow chart is good.

Hi,

in case replies are sent by a server UA via several TCP connections (for
example,
a new connection is created for each message) close out of which of the
connetions
must be treated by a client UA as CANCEL in case the transaction is not
complete?

Thanks a lot!

I don't know, there are some pretty serious regulatory issues involved.  I'm
almost inclined to say that SHOULD is to weak and that if the encryption key
information is not available then the ISUP information SHOULD NOT be
included in the SIP message.

This doesn't break the call, it just weakens the interoperability between
the SIP and PSTN networks.  All of the information necessary for the call to
be re-originated from the SIP network to the PSTN exists in the SIP headers.
The only loss is some of the information carried in the ISUP message (caller
id, reason codes, etc.).  This is analogous to interoperability between an
SS7 ISUP network and a CAS network, where information is lost when the call
is handed off to the CAS network.  The calls still work, just with a limited
set of features.
 
If it is absolutely necessary to include the ISUP for all call related
features to work then the calling gateway can insist on use of the security
pre-condition mechanism defined in the manyfolks draft.

Hi,

rfc2617.txt HTTP Authentication : Basic & Digest Access Authentication, section 3.2.2.3,
refers to H(entity-body), when calculating A2 if the QOP value is "auth-int".

3.2.2.4 goes on to describe H(entity-body) as the hash of the entity body, not the
message body.....

rfc2543 doesn't appear to elaborate on this!

Can someone please describe or point me towards some information describing
what constitutes the entity-body of a SIP message?

An example would also be useful!

Thanks In Advance
Phil Hoffer

There was a practical reason that this was added that I can't reconstruct at
the moment  (I know I've had white board discussions with Robert Sparks on
this one).  

I'll dig through my notes and the list archive to see if I can figure it
out.

For ACKS, it is given that the ACK request Uri is based on the Route (if any), else the Contact(if any)

else the To field of the 200 response.

Does this hold good for all other responses, such as > 200 status codes.(because the

record route makes sense only for 200 )

The reason for this question is:

Consider a situation such as:

endpt A --INVITE----> proxy A ----INVITE--> proxy B----> endpt B.

endpt B ---4xx----> proxy B  and proxy B ---ACKs---> endpt B and this continues to endpt A.

Here, how does proxy B know endpt B's address to send it an ACK.

Thanks!

hi,

    I would like to know if there exists a standard way to describe the
payload size  of the RTP stream. So for instance,

10, 20, 30 ms.  We've read the sip spec, but could not find it.

I think, You may use the attribute parameter in SDP (rfc-2327, page 22).

   a=ptime:<packet time>
     This gives the length of time in milliseconds represented by the
     media in a packet.

"Message body" and "entity body" are synonymous in SIP. Here is a quote
from sec. 3 of the RFC2543 that uses the terms interchangeably:

Both Request (section 4) and Response (section 5) messages use the
   generic-message format of RFC 822 [24] for transferring entities (the
   body of the message). Both types of messages consist of a start-line,
   one or more header fields (also known as "headers"), an empty line
   (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the carriage-return line-feed
   (CRLF)) indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional
   message-body. To avoid confusion with similar-named headers in HTTP,
   we refer to the headers describing the message body as entity
   headers.

My understanding concerning Acks for responses >=3D3xx:

- Set Request-URI based on Record-Route and Contact=20

it.=20

For ACKS, it is given that the ACK request Uri is based on the Route (if =
any), else the Contact(if any)
else the To field of the 200 response.

Does this hold good for all other responses, such as > 200 status =
codes.(because the
record route makes sense only for 200 )
The reason for this question is:
Consider a situation such as:

endpt A --INVITE----> proxy A ----INVITE--> proxy B----> endpt B.

endpt B ---4xx----> proxy B  and proxy B ---ACKs---> endpt B and this =
continues to endpt A.
Here, how does proxy B know endpt B's address to send it an ACK.

Sunitha,
 
The correct behavior for ACKs in the scenario you discuss is as follows:
 
A                       P1                        P2
B
INVITE--------------->
                           INVITE----------------->
 
INVITE--------------->
 
<--------------------4XX
 
ACK------------------->
                           <---------------------4XX
                           ACK-------------------->
<------------------- 4XX
ACK-------------------->
 
At each point, the ACK is sent to where the original request was sent.  Note
that P1 and P2 need to add a To tag when sending the response downstream to
know that the ACK was destined for them and not for B.
 
This is different then a 200 OK response, which looks like:
 
A                       P1                        P2
B
INVITE--------------->
                           INVITE----------------->
 
INVITE--------------->
 
<--------------------200
                           <---------------------200
<------------------- 200
ACK-------------------->
                           ACK-------------------->
 
ACK------------------->
 
In this case, the ACK is sent per the rules you mention (route if available,
etc.)
 
This is all fairly clearly described in section 10.5.1.
 
Steve

For ACKS, it is given that the ACK request Uri is based on the Route (if

else the To field of the 200 response.

Does this hold good for all other responses, such as > 200 status

The reason for this question is:
Consider a situation such as:

endpt A --INVITE----> proxy A ----INVITE--> proxy B----> endpt B.

Here, how does proxy B know endpt B's address to send it an ACK.

This flow does not apply to stateless proxies.  As stated in section 12.3 of
the RFC:

"...a stateless proxy forwards every request it
   receives downstream, and every response it receives upstream."

Thus the stateless proxy does not send the ACK.

I'm not sure I understand your question on reliability.

Subject: [SIP] Questions about SIP support for gateways connected to PBX's
Sender: sip-admin@lists.bell-labs.com

I'm looking into the development of an IP telephony system.  In particular,
I'm looking into the development of something like a PC-based key telephony
system in which user agents can access the PSTN or analog PBX extensions via
a gateway.  Each PC can monitor one or more of the PBX extensions/PSTN
telephone lines offered by the gateway, and each extension/PSTN line may be
monitored by one or more PC (We don't necessarily want to be able to dial
down to each individual computer.).  SIP seems like it can handle this at
the feature level, but I'm now at the point where I have some questions
about accessing the PSTN or a PBX via a gateway.  I'm hoping some of you can
help me.


1. Most PBX's allow access to their features (forwarding, transfer, etc.)
over analog lines through a hook-flash/DTMF sequence.  Does SIP support
this?  I haven't seen any information in the SIP drafts about supporting a
hook-flash as a digit, and I'm wondering if this (allowing the user agents
to control PBX features on the analog lines that are terminated by the
gateway) is supported by SIP in some way.

2. I have a related question about generating individual DTMF digits.
Assuming I'm using a gateway that can generate DTMF tones (probably a safe
assumption), does SIP support a means of instructing the gateway to insert
DTMF tones into an active call's audio?  This would be useful for the
previously-mentioned access of PBX features.  It would also be useful for
accessing systems with automated voice response or automated attendants.  My
reading of the drafts leads me to believe that this can be done (by sending
additional INVITE messages with the same Call ID and with
incrementally-longer digit strings), but I'd like to see my novice
interpretation of the draft confirmed by someone with more experience.  
     If I'm correct in thinking that this method allows the dialing of
individual digits, does that mean that overlap dialing is also supported by
SIP?  If my hunch is wrong and SIP doesn't support overlap dialing, does SIP
provide a way for me to open a call through the gateway without sending any
PSTN/PBX address digits (just to get dial-tone from the PBX or PSTN) so that
I can then generate digits locally and send them in the audio stream (not an
ideal solution if audio coding with lower bit-rates is used, but possibly
useful for my needs)?  

Thanks for your help!

I noticed in the Bake-off client classification form that there is an item:

"reject unknown request methods with 405 response"

I was under the impression that you respond to unknown methods with a 501
Not implemented response and the 405 response should only be sent if the
request is recognized but disallowed.

Robert.

Hi,

I' ve heard lots of people and I' ve read many documents (including the
excellent draft presented by Henry in Adealaide)  about QOS in
SIP-signaled networks, as well as about security (encryption of
signalling messages, at least).

Nevertheless I' ve not been able to find any official SIP drafts
tackling these issues: can anyone bief me about the state-of-the-art in
these two areas ?


   * did I miss some relevant WG document
   * or is it an explicit desire by the WG not to restrict the number of
     QOS mechanisms that can be utilized by implementors
   * or is it just a matter of time and we will have something like an
     informational RCF with a taxonomy of possible QOS
     methods/suggestions on how the various policy-based mechanisms can
     be coupled with SIP?

What about security ?

Thank you very much,
and apologies in advance, should this issue have already been
exetensively discussed by the list

I apologize for the formatting problem in the previous message, but it seems
like the question was understood.

If UDP proxies do not send ACKs, then that clears it up for me.
I was reading section 4.2.2: 

2xx responses are acknowledged by client user agents, all other final
responses by the first proxy or client user agent to receive the response.

It sounds like that only applies to TCP proxies.

Although it's moot now, I was wondering about the reliability of the 4XX on
it's way back to A.  If it were ACKed by P2, and lost between P2 and P1, or
P1 and A, then I figured that the INVITE would be have to be retransmitted
by A, which didn't seem correct.

Thanks for clarifying.

Eric.

This flow does not apply to stateless proxies.  As stated in section 12.3 of
the RFC:

"...a stateless proxy forwards every request it
   receives downstream, and every response it receives upstream."

Thus the stateless proxy does not send the ACK.

I'm not sure I understand your question on reliability.

Yes, the intention is to keep specific QoS mechanisms
apart from call signaling. The I-D draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-00.txt
desribes how QoS preconditions (regardless of QoS mechanism
being used) can be signaled with SIP/SDP. QoS mechanism
themselves are out of scope of SIP WG.

The I-D draft-sinnreich-interdomain-sip-qos-osp-01.txt is of 
informational nature and documents how to put all the pieces 
(SIP call signaling, RSVP QoS reservation, COPS Policy,
OSP settlement) in a complex commercial service provisioning 
environment together.

I agree with this.  The ISUP information must be treated as very sensitive,
by regulation (at least in the US).

Hi,

I' ve heard lots of people and I' ve read many documents (including the
excellent draft presented by Henry in Adealaide)  about QOS in
SIP-signaled networks, as well as about security (encryption of
signalling messages, at least).

Nevertheless I' ve not been able to find any official SIP drafts
tackling these issues: can anyone bief me about the state-of-the-art in
these two areas ?


   * did I miss some relevant WG document
   * or is it an explicit desire by the WG not to restrict the number of
     QOS mechanisms that can be utilized by implementors
   * or is it just a matter of time and we will have something like an
     informational RCF with a taxonomy of possible QOS
     methods/suggestions on how the various policy-based mechanisms can
     be coupled with SIP?

What about security ?

Thank you very much,
and apologies in advance, should this issue have already been
exetensively discussed by the list

According to the spec, you are correct.  The server should respond with a
501.

	"The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill
the request. This

request method

Hi Everyone,

I think the Grammer in rfc 2543 for "TO" field say that :
TO = ("TO" | "t") ":" (name-addr | addr-spec) *(";" addr-params)

questions:

1. Is there any limit for the character length in name-addr|addr-spec ?
2. there can be 0 or more addr-params -> (we can have multiple tags ? in
same "TO" ) is some thing worng with grammer here ?

Thanks : )

well, draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-00.txt doesn' t seem to me to be an
official WG I-D anyway.
So I would conclude that the WG is not even  interested in specifying  the
preconditions necessary for QOS mechanism to be applied to SIP-based
networks.

There's still some missing piece, or at least something I don' t understand,
in this picture, since it seems to me that previous discussions have clearly
shown how QOS handling appears to be the real driving force behind an
operator deploying a SIP-based network (without QOS there appear to be
little reason to have equipment in the core of the network: endpoints can
use SIP to call each other e2e)


Do you know anything about the security issue ? (signalling encryption)

Thank you very much

_Stateless_ UDP proxies do not send ACKs, stateful do. Note that
stateless proxies cannot generate responses of their own as well, they
just proxy responses according to the Via header.

Assuming you refer to the picture from your previous message and P1 and
P2 are stateless, no ACKs will be generated by either P1 or P2.  In this
situation, UAC A and UAS B will provide reliability so the ACK
effectively becomes end to end. The correct diagram follows:

A                       P1                        P2

There are two kinds of signaling encryption: end-to-end and hop-by-hop.

E2E is difficult if a SIP proxy in the middle of signaling chain
needs to know a particular message element for call processing.
RFC2543 introduces these header field classes: those which 
1) MUST NOT  be encrypted 2) MAY be encrypted 3) SHOULD be encrypted.

In fact, a caller never knows which of the fields really MAY be
encrypted because a SIP proxy in the middle may still want
to use a "MAY-be-encrypted" field for call processing logic.
The same applies also for SIP bodies. A proxy may want
to examine SDP payload in order to open pinholes in firewalls
or it possibly uses JPEGs in INVITEs to implement
"deny-calls-originating-from-skin-headed-callers" policy.

The most recent suggestion was to let caller encrypt whatever
he wants to and see if it works. If the encrypted message
encounters a SIP proxy which is unable to process it
the proxy sends an appropriate reply to the caller. The
reply may include some some hint on which parts of the message
were needed in plain text. Then, the caller will decide
if he wants to resend the message with indicated fields
in plain text or give up the call.

With HBH encryption, SIP messages are completely encrypted
but  all of the SIP entities along the signaling chain
see the messages (or part of them if E2E encrytion is
also used) in plain text. Which could make someone
who is concerned about privacy of his signaling worried.
To minimize the risk of disclosure of unencrypted signaling 
to untrusted proxies transitive HBH trust may be deployed.
Which means that SIP proxies forward HBH-encrypted SIP 
messages only to trusted adjacent proxies and assume they
will behave the same way.

With the exception of the proposal for "cannot process
encrypted fields" reply, all aforementioned issues are 
already addressed in the SIP RFC.

Giuseppe,
The I-D draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-00.txt
desribing how QoS preconditions can be signaled with SIP/SDP
is the result of multiple efforts that have been ongoing
among several people in the WG for a while now.

Several of us in the group are quite enthusiastic about it,
and think it will be very good for SIP in the future to
include the mechanisms and methods described in the draft.
It will also meet some of the critical requirements we have
as service providers too. My belief is that there is quite
a bit of support for the work.

It hasn't yet been included as part of a WG item probably because
a few issues (not-technical) need to be worked out. I hope these
will be overcome in the next few days/weeks and then we can help
progress it to a WG item, with consensus from people on the list
and the WG chairs.

Thanks,
       K. K. Ramakrishnan

Based on reports from Adelaide, it sounds like the consensus of the working
group was to progress the Call Flows I-D (draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt) to
Informational RFC as soon as possible.

One item that needs to be resolved first is the "phone-context" tag which is
used extensively in the Gateway dialing sections of the document for private
phone numbers (extensions).

In RFC2543, support for phone numbers in SIP URLs was included by including
parameters from the then current version of the Tel URL I-D if "user=phone" was
present.  Since then, there have been additional drafts of this document
(currently draft-antti-telephony-url-12.txt).

One of the critical additions to the Tel draft since RFC2543 was the addition of
the phone-context tag used for local numbers to identify the scope in which the
number is valid.  I believe this tag needs to be included in SIP URLs in the
next SIP draft.

For example, the U.S. directory assistance telephone number can be written in
global form as:

	sip:+1-314-555-1212@gateway.carrier.com;user=phone

However, if the number was only valid if dialed from within the U.S., the number
could be written as a local phone number as:

	sip:314-555-1212@gateway.carrier.com;phone-context=+1

Where the phone-context tag indicates that it is only valid from within country
code 1.

Another more compelling use of the phone-context tag is in dealing with private
numbers - numbers that are not part of the public number space, but are part of
a private numbering plan administered by a corporation or organization.  The
examples in the Call Flows document are of this kind:

	sip:777-1234@gateway.mycarrier.com;phone-context=mycarrier

In this example, it appears that the host portion (gateway address) of the URL
is sufficient to specify the context of the private number.  However, for cases
where a gateway is shared among multiple customers, each with possibly
overlapping private numbering plans, the use of phone-context is required:
	sip:777-1234@gateway.mycarrier.com;phone-context=mycarrier-customer1

The use of the phone-context tag also allows interdomain private dialing,
something impossible in todays PSTN.  For example, dialed digits for a
particular dialing plan could be sent to a proxy for gateway lookup

	sip:444-1000@proxy.wcom.com;phone-context=carrier-customer2

The proxy would lookup the gateway based on dialed digits and phone-context.  If
the proxy did not have gateway information for that carrier (domain), the
request could be proxied to that domain with the Request-URI becoming:

	sip:444-1000@proxy.carrier.com;phone-context=carrier-customer2

These are just a few examples of the use of this tag.

Are there any reasons why this tag should not be supported in SIP URLs in the
next draft of RFC2543?

Eric,

"Stateless proxy" and "UDP proxy" are not synonymous terms.  A stateful
proxy can support UDP.  The only limitation with regards to TCP and UDP is
that a proxy that supports TCP for an individual request must be stateful
for that request.

Giuseppe,

I would like to add the responses from Jiri Kuthan and K. K.
Ramakrishnan regarding QoS that for AAA issues: There was
interest in the AAAArch BOF for AAA functions for areas such as
SIP where admission control is depending on application servers
(such as SIP proxies) and there can be more complex models, such
as "the called party pays and admits the call", also using
clearinghouses. There may be some model I-Ds on this topic.

Suggest you may want to attend the AAAARch session at the next
IETF.

Henry

I agree completely that there is a great need for phone-context.
Draft-dcsgroup-sip-proxy-proxy-01 made a simple suggestion that
Figure 4 in RFC2543 be updated with the current syntax from
draft-antti-telephony-uri-12, since it apparently came from
there to begin with.

Discussions in Adelaide seemed to focus on the question of
whether ";phone-context" appeared to the left of the "@"
or to the right of the "@".  To the left of the "@" there
are already defined some tags, such as "isub=" and "postd=",
so there is obviously not an issue with parsers.  

Making it part of the telephone-subscriber syntax seems cleaner
in that it avoids confusion in cases such as
	sip:somethingorother@gateway;phone-context=mycarrier
where the meaning isn't at all clear; whereas
	sip:somethingorother;phone-context=mycarrier@gateway
means the username has some strange characters in it, and
	sip:somethingorother;phone-context=mycarrier@gateway;user=phone
means to apply the telephony-subscriber syntax to the username.

BTW, our use of phone-context is to store the fact that LNP dip
was done, and the results.

From: Alan Johnston <alan.johnston@wcom.com>
To: SIP <sip@lists.research.bell-labs.com>
Subject: [SIP] phone-context and RFC2543bis

Based on reports from Adelaide, it sounds like the consensus of the working
group was to progress the Call Flows I-D (draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt) to
Informational RFC as soon as possible.

One item that needs to be resolved first is the "phone-context" tag which is
used extensively in the Gateway dialing sections of the document for private
phone numbers (extensions).

In RFC2543, support for phone numbers in SIP URLs was included by including
parameters from the then current version of the Tel URL I-D if "user=phone" was
present.  Since then, there have been additional drafts of this document
(currently draft-antti-telephony-url-12.txt).

One of the critical additions to the Tel draft since RFC2543 was the addition of
the phone-context tag used for local numbers to identify the scope in which the
number is valid.  I believe this tag needs to be included in SIP URLs in the
next SIP draft.

For example, the U.S. directory assistance telephone number can be written in
global form as:

	sip:+1-314-555-1212@gateway.carrier.com;user=phone

However, if the number was only valid if dialed from within the U.S., the number
could be written as a local phone number as:

	sip:314-555-1212@gateway.carrier.com;phone-context=+1

Where the phone-context tag indicates that it is only valid from within country
code 1.

Another more compelling use of the phone-context tag is in dealing with private
numbers - numbers that are not part of the public number space, but are part of
a private numbering plan administered by a corporation or organization.  The
examples in the Call Flows document are of this kind:

	sip:777-1234@gateway.mycarrier.com;phone-context=mycarrier

In this example, it appears that the host portion (gateway address) of the URL
is sufficient to specify the context of the private number.  However, for cases
where a gateway is shared among multiple customers, each with possibly
overlapping private numbering plans, the use of phone-context is required:
	sip:777-1234@gateway.mycarrier.com;phone-context=mycarrier-customer1

The use of the phone-context tag also allows interdomain private dialing,
something impossible in todays PSTN.  For example, dialed digits for a
particular dialing plan could be sent to a proxy for gateway lookup

	sip:444-1000@proxy.wcom.com;phone-context=carrier-customer2

The proxy would lookup the gateway based on dialed digits and phone-context.  If
the proxy did not have gateway information for that carrier (domain), the
request could be proxied to that domain with the Request-URI becoming:

	sip:444-1000@proxy.carrier.com;phone-context=carrier-customer2

These are just a few examples of the use of this tag.

Are there any reasons why this tag should not be supported in SIP URLs in the
next draft of RFC2543?

ITU (SG11) is currently defining a variant of ISUP that is being called 
"Bearer Independent Call Control" (BICC).  I'm sure many of you are aware 
of this.

They have completed work for Q.BICC to handle Narrowband ISDN services over 
ATM (this is now numbered Q.1901) and they are now beginning work on IP and 
other networks.

It seems that networks using SIP will have to interwork with these networks 
as well as the current PSTN that uses ISUP.

Could (or should) this be included in the SIP-T draft?  Would it be its own 
type or could/should it be included as a value for the version or spec field?

One of the premises we were aiming for with this work was that the
originating gateway did not need to know the terminating entity (gateway
or otherwise) before launching the call. If the terminating entity was a
gateway, the ISUP information could be used and transparency is
achieved. If the terminating entity was not a gateway, the ISUP is
ignored and everything still works. I still believe this to be a
valuable goal, and I'd like to consider other options besides abandoning
it.

My assumption is that the only sensitive information, per se, is the
calling name and number (at least as far as regulatory issues in the
PSTN go). Are there any others?

So, some possibilities:

1. We rely on hop by hop encryption. If the message hits a point where
the next hop is not over an encrypted transport, the sensitive
information (or the ISUP message in its entirety) is removed. This is
kind of bad, since the proxies then need to examine bodies.

2. Variant on (1); if the call hits a non-encrypted hop, an error is
generated, and the originating gateway relaunches the INVITE without
ISUP or with the sensitive information removed. We talked about this
during the security task force meeting - a caller preferences extension
that could request a proxy to reject the request if it crosses a trust
boundary.

3. The calling name and number are removed from the ISUP message (or set
to something innocuous), and the information is conveyed using the DCS
mechanisms for caller privacy.

Others?

These preconditions are for security for the sessions (i.e., RTP), not
for SIP.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The SIP INFO Method
	Author(s)	: S. Donovan
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-info-method-03.txt
	Pages		: 10
	Date		: 06-Apr-00
	
This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP).  This extension adds the INFO method to the SIP
protocol.  The intent of the INFO method is to allow for the carrying
of session related control information that is generated during a
session.  One example of such session control information is ISUP and
ISDN signaling messages used to control telephony call services.
This and other example uses of the INFO method may be standardized in
the future.

I believe this may be too strong.  ISUP doesn't use end2end encryption 
today over the SS7 network which is essentially a connectionless packet 
network.  There is no reason to require end2end encryption for SIP-T when 
carrying ISUP over a similarly designed (in terms of security) IP network.

If a carrier doesn't want to carry ISUP in the clear over an IP network due 
to regulatory reasons, there is not reason it has to.  The carrier can 
require its vendors to provide the requisite features for this (such as you 
describe).

BTW, what (US) regulation covers security of ISUP?  I'd like to look it up.

Thanks,
Chip

Hello,

We are two students writing on a graduate thesis about VoIP security
with SIP/SDP/RTP, with focus on encrypting the media stream. We are
new to this, and would be grateful for help on this subject.

There are some problems transferring or agreeing on a session
encryption key using the k= field in SDP, if one are to send it in a
SIP INVITE through a NAT. Since the NAT needs to change some fields in
the SDP description, the SDP must not be encrypted.

The end user should be oblivious of the FW/NAT and thus should neither
query it for the adresses to enter into the SDP, nor depend on the FW
to encrypt anything.

A couple of possible solutions (?).

The simplest (and least secure) way to transfer a symmetric key would
be that the caller enters his public key (or Diffie-Hellman "A") into
the k= field of the SDP.

"k=base64:<caller key>"

together with a couple of attributes that could look something like

"a=key-encr-alg:RSA"
or
"a=key-encr-alg:D-H"

for describing the algorithm the key in the k= field corresponds to,
and

"a=media-encr-alg:3DES-CBC"

for describing preferred media encryption algorithm.

In case of RSA, the "callers key" is the public key, corresponding to
a private key only known by him. In case of Diffie-Hellman the
"callers key" is the "A"-part of the partly built media key.

The callee then generates a "callee key". In case of RSA, this is the
symmetric media key, encrypted using the callers public key. In case
of Diffie-Hellman, the "callee key" is the "B"-part of the partly
built symmetric media key. The callee sends this back in the k= field
in the SDP of the 180 response. Should the callee fail to meet the
specific security wishes of the caller, it could simply omit the k=
field in the response, and the caller could choose to proceed and not
encrypt the media or just hang up.

  CALLER		          SIP-PROXY(s)                   CALLEE
    |                           |                           |
    | INVITE w/SDP(caller's key)|                           |
    |-------------------------->| INVITE w/SDP(caller's key)|
    |                           |-------------------------->|
    |                           |                           |
    |                           |   100                     |

    |   180 w/SDP(callee's key) |<--------------------------|
    |<--------------------------|                           |

Another way could be to insert something similar to a TLS handshake
(or some other more secure way of agreeing on or transferring keys)
into the Reservation stage in the QoS/security negotiation described
in draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-00.txt.

This would probably also need a couple of attributes to tell the
callee which handshake protocol should be used.

Comments?

(After reading RFC 1889 (RTP), 1890 (AVP), 2327 (SDP), 2543 (SIP), and a
number of drafts, we have not found any solutions to the problems
described above.)

In RFC 2543, there are two magic numbers: seven and eleven.

  Page 89:
          Retransmissions cease when the client has sent a total of ELEVEN
packets
 
  Page 91:
          or once it has sent a total of 7 request packets.

Is there any particular reasons for them? 

Thanks,

Renwei

This is a secret, but a major U.S. convenience store chain is sponsoring
this work. They are into sips of slurpee and coffee, I gather. Other
numbers (e.g., for status codes) are still available for sponsorship.

The numbers were picked more-or-less arbitrarily, as a compromise
between the likely network failure rates, reasonable time-outs (i.e., if
you didn't get a response in that interval, somebody else will likely
lose patience anyway) and avoiding continuous flooding of the network.

More seriously, there is a rationale way to determine when to stop
retransmitting. It has to do with the original value of the retransmission
timer, the exponential back-off and its 4 second cap, and the application
level timers in telephony gateways.

Would it be possible to explain in the draft exactly when to use the INFO

K. K. sums it up nicely. It is my personal hope to poll the WG on inclusion
of the manyfolks work as core WG activity once we get the RFC2026 stuff
worked out. I think it has fairly broad applicability.

Ok, I'll bite. What's so sensitive in ISUP that wouldn't be sensitive if
carried in SIP headers?

I think rather the issue is that ISUP assumes full transitive trust among
everybody and hence if you don't trust the next hop for everything there's
no way to "scrub" the ISUP body and hence you have to drop the whole
bag-o-bits.
Encryption just hides the sucker from eavesdroppping and modification by
intermediate baddies.

Right?

I have some doubts about the lookup key used by the registrar. Let us say
that a user A sends a REGISTER to his registrar :

REGISTER mydomain.com:5060 SIP/2.0
Via: ...
From: ...
Call-ID: ...
CSeq: ...
To: <userA@mydomain.com>
Contact: <sip:userA.sipphone.com:5055;maddr=1.2.3.4>;expires=7200
Content-Length:0

Now, there are 2 fundamental questions :

1) How to locate the registrations of userA
Use "userA@mydomain.com" as search key. Is that a correct answer ??
(In other words use user@host as the search key.)

2) How to determine if this Contact updates an existing Contact or is a new
Contact ?

At one point, the spec says SIP URI in Contact should be compared according
to the URI comparison rules and then subsequently it says registrations are
matched based on the user, host, port and maddr parameters. 
Can someone clarify this ??

Thanks,
Shail

Folks,

Thank you for your attention to my presentation of
our mobility management requirement in Adelaide.

Let me add a brief explanation about a relation between
SIP and wireless soft hand-off, since I feel I didn't answer
raised questions well. Please read the related part (4.1)
of our revised draft <draft-itsumo-sip-mobility-req-01> also.

First, we believe that the requirement wireless
'technology-independent" is very important principle.
At the same time, the soft hand-off is one of the key
technology promising high efficiency for the CDMA-based
wireless system. So any protocol on top of the wireless
shall not break the soft hand-off capability in the
wireless part. These are our basic assumptions.

The soft hand-off has some aspects like giving smooth hand-off
taking several tens seconds or more for the radio path change
and giving more than one radio paths during the hand-off.
If the soft hand-off is handled in the L2 only or below
L3 and doesn't affect the upper layer process, it is no
problem with SIP.

But if we consider the future RAN using IP transport,
SIP User Agent and/or Proxy Server may need a process
to support the mobility management on top of the soft hand-off.
Because SIP controls smooth hand-off of its IP sessions.

Although the details are still open issues, this is the
basic consideration about the soft hand-off.
Any questions and comments are welcomed.

Thank you.

Baba//

Hi Baba,

I am not sure that I understand the requirements as discussed here.  I understand that the technology independance requirement, and quite like that, however I dont understand the need of the SIP protocol level to be involved in the Soft hand-off.  I would have expected that the soft hand-off would be entirely within the "access network" (the mobile network technology), from the prespective of the SIP applications.  As such, the application shouldnt even be aware of the hand-overs (wont even change IP address).

Regards,

..//steve

Hi, Baba and Steve:

I guess that Steve is right.

Let us keep the activities of the lower layer (e.g., link/network) separate
from the application layer (e.g., SIP) as far as practicable.

For example, if the network layer address (e.g., IP address) is not changed
during the soft-handover why should we bring that abstraction to the
application layer (e.g., SIP)?

Best regards,

In a nutshell, the soft hand-off  process

 i.   a mobile station (MS) commences communication
      with a new base station (BS) without interuppting
      communication with the old base station. In
      other word, the MS receives multiple copies of
      the "same" signal  from multiple BSs simultaneously.
 ii.  Then, the MS (DSP algorithms within the hand set) forwards
      a weighted combination of the received signal to the higher layers.

Thus, in order to maintain advantages of the soft hand-off process in
an IP environment, during the soft hand-off process of an MS (refered
to as the MS, hereafter)

   a.  the packets destined for the MS should be forwarded to
        multiple BSs (at least current and previous ones) during the
        soft hand-off process to ensure that signals received from
        different BSs carries actual user data, and
   b. multiple copies of the same packet forwarded by different
       BSs to the MS must arrive at the MS synchronously so that at the
       CDMA layer all signals contain identical user information, and
       accurate information is forwarded to higher layers of the MS.

Without much elaboration, we refer to (a) and (b) as "virtual"
soft hand-off in <draft- itsumo-sip-mobility-req-01.txt>. In
order to support it, we need to commence a synchronous multicast
of packets bound for the MS to multiple BSs during the soft hand-off
process and this is where SIP gets involved.  A simple and neat resoultion
of this problem is a challenge and we are currently working on it.

One last point, one way for ensuring wireless "technlogy independence"
axiom/requirement is that the MS may communicate its hand-off
preference (soft or hard) to its corresponding host via the SDP.

Hi Steve and Radhika,

Thank you for your comments.

First of all, I agree with you that SIP needs to do nothing in
any case if IP address of Mobile Station (MS) is not changed.

And I also agree with both of you in the case of certain (and maybe
popular) architecture, e.g. the one on which 3GPP or 3GPP2 is
working right now. Because in this case the soft hand-off is
completely processed in or under the layer 2 and MS can not
distinguish if it is the hard hand-off or the soft hand-off from
upper layers.

As Faramak mentioned in his reply, we are looking at the future RAN
which will use the IP even for its transport method, i.e. IP
in the RAN or IP to the BTS, at the same time. Even in this case,
the mobility management by SIP shall not break the soft hand-off
process using IP communication. That is the point where we are
thinking as one of the important principles.

Regards,

baba//

	Title		: Mobility Management in a SIP Environment Requirements,
                          Functions and Issues
	Author(s)	: F. Vakil, A. Dutta, J. Chen,  S. Baba,
                          Y. Shobatake, H. Schulzrinne

Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception in
communication services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as
the signaling protocol for multimedia applications on the Internet.
Thus, it is essential to develop a mobility management scheme that
utilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well as other
protocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently.
Without providing any specific solution, this document presents
preliminary requirements and identifies the issues that need to be
resolved in order to develop a mobility management scheme for
supporting multimedia applications in a SIP signaling and control
environment.

Alan,

I believe the existing SIP syntax allows for arbitrary URI parameters, so
there really aren't any syntactic changes needed.  The real question is the
semantics. I don't believe the semantics of which you want to use
"phone-contet" for have been discussed on the list.

I'd suggest you write your thoughts up as an ID and share them with us. I
think the basic idea sounds pretty good, but I'd like to see a more complete
framing of your intent.

One can envision a layer-2 hand off, a layer-3 (mobile-IP) hand off, or a
layer-4 handoff . . .

This mobility approach seems to me to be appropriate to a layer-4 handoff,
wherein the IP address actually changes. This has applicability outside
classic mobilephone. For example, when I undock my PC, I might want to
switch from my wired 100TX card to my wireless 802.11 card. Both can be
active during handoff -- then I shut down the wired card and undock.

I understand what you want to do.  I like it.
I don't like saying that because your IP address changed,
ALL application level protocols have to know about it.

If that's what you want to do, let's purge the app level
protocols of the part that changes, even if we have to add a layer
somewhere.  It SHOULD NOT require changes in EVERY protocol
to make real mobility work.  

That is the basic issue I see with the flurry of mobility efforts.
These guys are EVERYWHERE telling us that we have to change what we
are doing in order to accommodate mobility.  There isn't a protocol
effort I'm involved in that doesn't have a cadre of people trying
to get something in it to make mobility work.

That is just plain wrong.  If mobility is, or is about to be,
ubiquitous, then we should change IP if we have to.  We should not
change SIP, LDAP, COPS, ISUP, DNS, NTP, HTTP, FTP, RADIUS,
and every other protocol we really use.  

It is entirely inappropriate for any session level protocol, let alone
session establishment protocols, to have knowledge that the end
device is mobile.  It's like having the protocol have to know
whether they are on a LAN or a WAN.  Somewhere, someone cares,
but it shouldn't be SIP!

Hi,

Is this a layer 2 multicast?  If so, it seems this problem could be solved 
by simply changing the ARP table during soft handoff.  Am I missing 
something here?

thanks,

I am glad that I am not alone. I had begun believing that we had lost sight
of the objective of having a layered protocol. If we cannot localize the
knowledge of delivery addresses, we have probably broken the protocol and
will have to go back and start over as soon as the next major evolutionary
change happens. It appears to me that if we have chosen to use UDP and TCP,
the necessity of having IP and the associated IP addresses underneath it
should be explicitly rejected. Some other protocol should be allowed at
that level if it works better. In the same sense that HDLC works best in
some spaces and Ethernet works better in others. If we are keeping the type
of network hardware separate form the application level, it is highly
illogical that we should expect the app to know about changes required for
mobility. Someone pointed out that simultaneous arrival of duplicate frames
is important for soft handoff. Should the SIP application be tasked with
tracking the transmission delay for multiple routes in order to make this
happen? If we get carried away and make the protocol monolithic there will
be very little chance for it to succeed.

Hello,

If the MS IP address does not change during the soft hand-off
(i.e., cells belong to the same subnet) you are right in principle.
However, if the cells belong to different subnets and the MS IP
address changes, we need to multicast at the IP layer.

Regards, Faramak

Hi, Everyone:

It appears to me that some people may think: SIP can only be used in certain
special circumstances.

However, per RFC 2534, SIP is an application layer control (signaling)
protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions with one or more
participants.

So, SIP can be used for all networking environments: Fixed wire-line
networks, cellular (wireless) networks, and/or wireless LANs.

In the cell-based networking environment, 100s and 1000s of users will be
entering and leaving a cell while each session has to go on using SIP.

Definitely, there may be some special requirements especially for the highly
mobile cellular (wireless) networking environments (or in combination of
fixed + mobile) that have NOT been envisioned in RFC 2534. Some of these
issues have been surfaced in some recent internet drafts and email
discussions.

As a result, it is no wonder that we may see some extensions of SIP to
accommodate those requirements in the future.

We might have to address those issues to make SIP a powerful application
layer control protocol that can be used in all networking environments.

Going forward, let us address those technical issues keeping our eyes open.
(Let us keep in our mind that SIP still needs extensions even for the fixed
wire-line networking environment - not to speak about highly mobile
communications networking environments).

Hi,

Perhaps out of all of the replies, this is the most appropriate to respond to.

It is interesting that it is pointed out here that for some of the popular archectures where this is being considered that the soft hand-over doesnt come into the process as it happens at layer 2.  It is also interesting to not that a significant portion of those archectures do run on top of IP.  I think that it is required to remember where the IP network that the Application in the mobile terminal sees actually is - it is not necessary the IP network that is used to run the RAN.

Regards,

Brian,

I think the more interesting question is what you
do when there is no end to end transparency. In
particular, what do you do when you have non-IP
mobile devices which are proxied by IP devices
which terminate the RTP flows into something
else. Sound like anything familiar?

In that case, end to end transparency is already
fogged and it's not entirely clear that mobile IP
is the right answer; it could just as easily be
modeled as a decomposed trunking situation where
the application layer MGC deals with the hard
handoffs. In this case, I don't think you are
inventing unreasonable application layer mobility
awareness since any SIP needs to have the ability
to deal with mid-call SDP changes (codecs, if
nothing else). The mobile SIP on the other hand
could deal with the hows and whens of the handoff
burden but that's not an unreasonable thing to
ask; in fact it's a feature, not a bug that a SIP
application could manage mobility in this way.

		Mike

I honestly think this topic should be discussed in another WG, which WG is
something for others (IAB, Area Directors) to decide.

Hi, Everyone:

I feel that it will be conflicting if we discuss this in another WG because
of the following:

1. To support mobility in the application layer for session layer, it will
require to extend the SIP.
2. SIP WG  has the sole authority to see whether the extension for mobility
in SIP is consistent with the overall architecture.
3. SIP is the control protocol for all networking environments.

The only thing that I can foresee is: To form a separate sub-group within
the SIP so that SIP WG can see the overall consistency in extensions.

Best regards,

Radhika R. Roy

When building a telephone network a very important factor is GoS - Grade of
Service, i.e. the probability that a call will block due to resources not being
available. I would like to confirm my understanding of how this can happen with
SIP.

If resources for a call are not available the call should block before the
called party is alerted. For this to happen both endpoints must have all the
information they need to know to perform resource reservation before the called
party is alerted, and they should be able to communicate this availability.

Assuming RSVP is going to be used for resource reservation:

These events are required for a reservation: (taken from RSVP rfc)
      H1   A receiver joins the multicast group specified by
           DestAddress, using IGMP.

      H2   A potential sender starts sending RSVP Path messages to the
           DestAddress.

      H3   A receiver application receives a Path message.

      H4   A receiver starts sending appropriate Resv messages,
           specifying the desired flow descriptors.

      H5   A sender application receives a Resv message.

      H6   A sender starts sending data packets.

As far as I understand the SIP exchange of INVITE, RINGING does not permit this.

I will look at a point to point full duplex audio call:

The calling end determines the local address to which media should be sent
The calling end sends INVITE, passing the local address to which media should be
sent.
The calling end cannot make any resource reservation yet, since it does not know
the destination address for media
The INVITE is routed to the receiving end of the call.
The receiving end of the call can now send a RSVP path message back to the
calling end to reserve a media path in that direction
The called end determines the local media address where media should be
received.
The called end sends this local address to the calling end via a 183 response
The called end starts alerting

Here is the problem. The called end has started alerting without knowing that
bandwidth has been reserved in the direction from the calling end to the called
end. Potentially when the user picks up the phone only a one way voice path will
be possible.

To solve this problem an ACK to the 183 response, confirming that bandwidth is
available should be sent from the calling end before ringing commences.

Sunitha,
 
Given that the INFO message can only be used in the context of an existing
session, I'm not so sure that a standalone INFO call flow would be very
useful (much less very interesting, given that it would be a simple INFO,
200 ok exchange, or INFO, 481 exchange if it occurred outside of an existing
session).
 
It might, however, be useful to have a call flow that shows the use of the
INFO message to carry mid-call signaling.
 
This seems like a candidate for the call flow document.  
 
Steve

Hi : 

Are there any call flows with the INFO method, similar to the ones in the
call flow document. 
  


Thanks!

While this is pretty much the current state of affairs, I would like to
point out even the SIP terminal mobility solution affects more than one
protocol. 

Changes to both SIP and to DHCP and I suspect IP itself are needed. The IETF
also standardizes PPP extensions for address assignment and agent discovery,
etc.. 

Address assignment, VPN support, NATs, Firewalls, policy metrics, multicast
and routing in general are all affected by the mobility solution. 

The point is that mobility solutions can affect more than one protocol. 

The decomposition of a PSTN gateway has led us to the advantage of this
particular solution for a particular business case - namely legacy
circuit-based cellular. This same decomposition led us into Megaco I might
add.

If the IAB wants to solve just this business case, then so be it. If they
want to do more then so be it. Either way more than one protocol is
affected. Right now the solution is being worked adhoc in multiple WGs. 

If this is the correct way to proceed, I have no problem with it.

From my understanding the SIP terminal mobility solution does not =
require
changes to every application even without dynamic DNS updates. This is =
a
common misconception.=20

Perhaps Hennning or someone could describe the interactions when =
someone
wants to FTP to another IP based terminal with a mobile user. Will FTP =
have
to change?

&lt;draft-itsumo-sip-mobility-req-01&gt; also.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; First, we believe that =
the requirement wireless</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; =
'technology-independent&quot; is very important principle.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time, the =
soft hand-off is one of the key</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; technology promising =
high efficiency for the CDMA-based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; wireless system. So =
any protocol on top of the wireless</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; shall not break the =
soft hand-off capability in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; wireless part. These =
are our basic assumptions.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; The soft hand-off has =
some aspects like giving smooth hand-off</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; taking several tens =
seconds or more for the radio path change</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; and giving more than =
one radio paths during the hand-off.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; If the soft hand-off =
is handled in the L2 only or below</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; L3 and doesn't affect =
the upper layer process, it is no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with =
SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; But if we consider the =
future RAN using IP transport,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; SIP User Agent and/or =
Proxy Server may need a process</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; to support the =
mobility management on top of the soft hand-off.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">&gt; &gt; &gt; Because SIP controls =

Hi, Everyone:

We are concentrating to extend SIP to support mobility - I guess that it
clear. It is an application protocol. SIP WG is chartered for this because
SIP is applicable for all networking communications environments.

Even now, we are discussing SIP in the context of NATs, firewalls, etc.
whether there is a mobility or not. It is the nature of on-going standard
works because people like to use it in many situations. In fact, it is a
healthy state of business because it proves the popularity of SIP to be a
real one - not just niche market.

Let us NOT predict something based on unnecessary fear. Today, we are taking
care-of how SIP's extensions are affecting the works of MMUSIC, IPTEL, etc.
It is a nature of standard works. We have not even decided what needs in SIP
to support mobility. Once we know this, we will go step by step as we do for
other cases.

In SIP WG, we will concentrate for extensions of SIP to support mobility
only.

Hope this will further clarify.

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy
AT&T

PS: MEGACO is different story - it is a stand-alone case all by itself. It
can be used by SIP if needed.

Radhika,

Would you like to take this view back to the ITU (SG16), where you disagreed
with the same point when I made it about H.323 to try to save people the vast
amounts of unnecessary work they're doing there on mobility?

Regards,
Chris

Chris:

I disagreed with you that we should not keep our solution assuming that all
mobility related things will be transparent to the appln. (e.g., H.323)
layer.

The work H.323 mobility is going-on. All renown companies that are building
mobility related equipment throughout the world are a part of it.

Now there are internet-drafts related to SIP mobility as well.

Let me clarify: If the network point of attachment is NOT changed, there is
almost (some non-real-time mobility management may be needed) no need to do
anything in the application layer (e.g., SIP, H.323). But it is only a
special situation.

In many situations, it may not be possible. We are addressing those from
mobility management point of view. There can be two aspects of this: 1.
Should we consider hand-off in the appln layer? 2. Should we consider NO
handoff in the appln layer?

I hope that we could agree that the mobility solution would be transparent
to the application layer (we could save our time)!

Best regards,
Radhika

When building a telephone network a very important factor is GoS - Grade of
Service, i.e. the probability that a call will block due to resources not being
available. I would like to confirm my understanding of how this can happen with
SIP.

If resources for a call are not available the call should block before the
called party is alerted. For this to happen both endpoints must have all the
information they need to know to perform resource reservation before the called
party is alerted, and they should be able to communicate this availability.

Assuming RSVP is going to be used for resource reservation:

These events are required for a reservation: (taken from RSVP rfc)
      H1   A receiver joins the multicast group specified by
           DestAddress, using IGMP.

      H2   A potential sender starts sending RSVP Path messages to the
           DestAddress.

      H3   A receiver application receives a Path message.

      H4   A receiver starts sending appropriate Resv messages,
           specifying the desired flow descriptors.

      H5   A sender application receives a Resv message.

      H6   A sender starts sending data packets.

As far as I understand the SIP exchange of INVITE, RINGING does not permit this.

I will look at a point to point full duplex audio call:

The calling end determines the local address to which media should be sent
The calling end sends INVITE, passing the local address to which media should be
sent.
The calling end cannot make any resource reservation yet, since it does not know
the destination address for media
The INVITE is routed to the receiving end of the call.
The receiving end of the call can now send a RSVP path message back to the
calling end to reserve a media path in that direction
The called end determines the local media address where media should be
received.
The called end sends this local address to the calling end via a 183 response
The called end starts alerting

Here is the problem. The called end has started alerting without knowing that
bandwidth has been reserved in the direction from the calling end to the called
end. Potentially when the user picks up the phone only a one way voice path will
be possible.

To solve this problem an ACK to the 183 response, confirming that bandwidth is
available should be sent from the calling end before ringing commences.

Keep in mind that both RFC 2327 (SDP) and RFC 1890 (AVP) seem to say
that you can ignore the value of ptime:

RFC2327, Section 6, "Suggested Attributes":

	 It should not be necessary to know ptime to decode RTP or
	 vat audio, and it is intended as a recommendation for the
	 encoding/packetisation of audio.

RFC1890, Section 4.2:

	 A receiver should accept packets representing between 0
	 and 200ms of audio data.

RFC1890, Section 4.3:

	 All frame-oriented audio codecs should be able to encode
	 and decode several consecutive frames within a single packet.

I think another very important issue here is how to keep a given QoS for a
established call, how do we guarantee the current QoS of at the next
location? maybe there will not be enough bandwidth at that point and the
hand-off will fail anyway.

Brian,

I think the more interesting question is what you
do when there is no end to end transparency. In
particular, what do you do when you have non-IP
mobile devices which are proxied by IP devices
which terminate the RTP flows into something
else. Sound like anything familiar?

In that case, end to end transparency is already
fogged and it's not entirely clear that mobile IP
is the right answer; it could just as easily be
modeled as a decomposed trunking situation where
the application layer MGC deals with the hard
handoffs. In this case, I don't think you are
inventing unreasonable application layer mobility
awareness since any SIP needs to have the ability
to deal with mid-call SDP changes (codecs, if
nothing else). The mobile SIP on the other hand
could deal with the hows and whens of the handoff
burden but that's not an unreasonable thing to
ask; in fact it's a feature, not a bug that a SIP
application could manage mobility in this way.

		Mike

Hi, Everyone:

Yes, it is right that QOS issues need to be addressed. We may proceed as
follows:

1. First, let us see how SIP can support mobility while a mobile user moves
from one place to another (e.g., maintain the session level connectivity).
2. Second, how the QOS is maintained in the mobile environment.

We are addressing the first one for now.

For QOS, we are waiting to see the final standard of SIP that supports QOS
considering the fixed environment. When it is complete, we can then use it
for extension in mobile environment (I hope that we can do although it is a
complex problem).

However, when the two endpoints do not support the same level of QOS, they
may fall back to the common denominator (e.g., best-effort). It may be true
for both fixed and mobile environment. In mobile environment, there may be
additional requirements. For example, service providers may have to make
apriori agreement what will happen if the same level of QOS is not provided.

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy

I was going to jump in earlier ... but I agree with at least layer
3 ... and therefore SIP should be aware of soft handoff.

The issue here is that you get redundant streams (from the
voice payload point of view) from two different sources/sinks
during soft handoff.

If only one "end" was in the process of soft handoff ... I think
some combination of also/replace (with same call_id) would
work ... with a codec that knows what do to with two (payload)
redundant streams. The situation gets messy when both ends
are undergoing soft handoff or conferencing cases. I think
this is what Faramak was referring to as being difficult.

Hi,

I'm wondering the same thing as what Radhika raised.
Because I think some issues of the mobility management could
have to be discussed in the SIP WG.

Of course, we may be able to discuss whole issues separately first,
then come back to the WG with the related issues only later.
But I don't know if it works effectively or not.
So I would like to hear more suggestions.
That would help me to make my view clear either.

Regards,

baba//

The SIP WG charter does not currently include mobility solutions in
it's scope. However mobility support will be a key aspect of evolving
networks and there is a specific WG in the IETF which deals with it -
Mobile IP.

The Mobile IP WG is currently debating multiple I-Ds that propose
handoffs at the network layer. If at all handoffs are to be moved to
upper layers (from link/physical layers) then it may be optimal to do
it at the network layer.

While it's potentially OK to have a pre-shared
secret between a proxy and a UA, it clearly
doesn't scale well to have a mesh of pre-shared
secrets between all of the UA's for end to end
authentication of SIP traffic. As far as I can
remember, there's a way to send a key end to end
in the k: field of SDP, but that suffers from
two problems:

1) the key is intended for what the SDP
   announcement is describing, which is normally
   just a media descriptor. I don't think it
   is intended to be used for SIP session level
   keying. If there's a standard way to describe
   how to tell the UAS that that key ought to
   also be used for, say, http-authenticate's,
   that would probably be a fine solution.

2) the key is shipped in the clear. If there
   is no underlying transport crypto, then
   the key is really in the clear which makes
   the entire use of crypto rather dubious.

Toward the latter, assuming there is no transport
level security, maybe an acceptable alternative is
to use hop-by-hop keying between the UAC->Po Po->Pt
and Pt->UAS. In that case, we could use the
existing pre-shared secret for proxy-authenticate,
say, to encrypt the key itself in the SDP
announcement. 

Has anybody thought about this issue before? Is
this one of those areas where header encryption
might actually be useful, but for hop-by-hop
instead of end to end?

Sorry for the long hiatus between IETF and this message.

I promised at the SIP working group to talk with Erik Guttman about the
standardization procedure for SLP templates and post the procedure
here.

The procedure does not require that the template be an RFC, only
that it be an Internet draft. Once the template has been finalized,
there is an email address (srvloc-list@iana.org). The list hasn't been 
activated yet, but Erik says that if the template is sent to
him, he'll make sure that it gets into the template repository.
Erik is the "designated export" who is maintaining the repository.

I would suggest that the working group consider submitting the
template after working group last call on any drafts that
may impact the template. In fact, having the template go through
a last call when the drafts do would also help assure that it
accurately reflects the SIP protocol. Naturally, it would help
if the template draft were a working group item, but I'm prepared
to move it along as an individual contribution if the working
group would rather not include it (I should note that the NAT
working group has included the RSIP template as a working group
item).

Comments?

When you put it this way, it sounds pretty much like a call transfer between

Hi Basavaraj,

In SIP, there is a 're-invite' scheme which makes
user mobility available. I think this is more powerful
than the network layer hand-off in some cases.
So I'm not sure that all user/application requirement
is satisfied with the network layer hand-off.

Then a question comming up to me is,
Are you suggesting the need of cooperation between
SIP/application layer and the network layer mobility
management protocol?
or the solution in the network layer only for all
problem with mobility?

I just want to understand what you said.
Thank you.

   I think there are actually two things, both
   useful in their own right:

   1) "Call Transfer" where the call state is
      "moved" from one UA to another. This 
      might be how you do hard handoff. (?)

   2) "Conferencing" where a UA decides which
      speakers/microphones to turn on/off at
      any given time based on some feedback.      

   The latter is what I was describing, though
   in the context of mobility. In that case, it's
   a matter of chasing the moving
   speaker/microphone rather than tuning one in at
   a time.

Thinking aloud, there is definitely a need for cooperation between the

Subject: [SIP] SIP Info Method and IS-41 Cellular Signalling Protocol

I'm working on a design for replacing the IS-41 North American cellular
signalling protocol with IP protocols. I had a couple of questions about
how the SIP INFO method, or potentially another SIP method, might
be used.

1) In the introduction to draft-ietf-sip-info-method-03.txt, exchange
of radio signal strength information is explicitly mentioned as
an application of the SIP INFO method. The HandoffMeasurementRequest
and HandoffMeasurementRequest2 messages in IS-41 are sent by the anchor
Mobile Switching Center (MSC) to a potential serving MSC to obtain information 
about the signal strength of a Mobile Station (MS) in order to determine
if the potential serving MSC is a better candidate for handling the
mobile's call (called "hard handoff" in cellular jargon). They could be 
replaced with a SIP INFO method. There are three problems:

	a) The radio information is always solicited by the anchor MSC,
	and from the ID, the SIP INFO method seems like it is 
	sent unsolicted. I suppose one could come up with two INFO
	methods, one to solicit the radio information and one to
	return it, but this seems like a hack somehow.
	
	b) In the ID, it explicitly states that the INFO method is 
	only applicable when there is a call in progress. Problem is,
	there isn't a call in progress between the anchor MSC and
	the serving MSC, that's why the anchor MSC is soliciting
	the radio quality information in the first place.
	
	c) The INFO method seems like it is meant to be sent between 
	SIP UAC's, while the HandoffMeasurementRequest(2) methods
	are primarily designed to be sent between network elements.
	A SIP replacement would probably be sent between the last hop SIP
	proxies acting as Call Agents (CAs) for the call, which replaces
	the MSC in an all IP network.

2) There are a bunch of IS-41 messages that involve transmitting
feature or other information between the MS's Home Location
Register (HLR) and the MS. These are initiated by either the serving
MSC or the HLR. Examples are InformationDirective, which is used
by the HLR to provide notifications to an idle MS, and FeatureRequest,
which sends particular features to a potentially idle MS (features
being things like messages or playing particular tones). Again, these
seem like candidates to replace with the SIP INFO message, but 
the potential lack of any call in progress would prohibit that.

The alternative I could see would be establishing a session in order
to then send the information via the INFO method, but that seems like
overkill. And in the case of HandoffMeasurementRequest(2), the
message isn't intended for a SIP UAC anyway.

Maybe SIP is the wrong protocol to consider, since it is dedicated
to setting up and maintaining sessions, and not to exchanging information
between network elements or between network elements and terminals?

Can anybody provide some guidance?

I'm coming into this discussion late so please excuse me if I'm repeating
anything. I've just spent the last three months working with the
Mobile Wireless Internet Forum on how to introduce IP into the radio
access network (RAN) in 3G CDMA systems, and we will be continuing this
discussion until a concluding report is made in August. In March, I
posted some notes to the mobile IP mailing list where a discussion
of "micro-mobility" was underway. I`ve been planning to write up these thoughts 
in an ID sometime soon, since the question of replacing soft handoff with IP 
mobility solutions keeps coming up, but in the interim, here is a summary.

Within the RAN, there is no one to one mapping between
the octet stream of a call coming into the RAN and the octet stream
coming out into the IP stack on the mobile. The RAN controller
breaks the incoming octet stream into multiple (up to 6) streams that are
then sent to multiple base stations. In the mobile, the multiple
incoming radio signals are combined at L1 to produce the packet
that appears in the IP stack. Similarly, on return, multiple copies of
a packet from the mobile flow from the multiple base stations to the
RAN controller where the best one is selected (called frame selection or 
macrodiversity combination). So it is not possible to assign a single base 
station (and thus a single SIP registrar server or mobile IP FA in
the RAN) to the mobile. 

Exactly how to utilize IP in the RAN is an open question, but nobody
I've talked to thinks that the IP packets coming out of the mobile
will be running directly on L2 over the RAN anytime soon. In current
networks, the RAN controller takes the incoming voice and shapes
it into packets that the base station can quickly take out and
send over the air. Similarly, in the other direction, the base
station takes packets off the air and sends them largely unmodified
to the RAN controller. So the traffic in the RAN looks like radio packets. 
There is alot of very sophisticated (and proprietary) control protocol
between the base stations and the RAN controller, involving signal
processing, for doing soft handoff. There are also very tight
delay and jitter constraints. The RAN controller has time slots
between 5 and 80 ms to reach the base station, if it misses a time
slot, the base station tells it that it needs to do better, and the
packet may be dropped, potentially resulting in a degradation of
call quality. Most proposals for using IP in the RAN involve simply
replacing the L2 transport as specified with IP, so the current
proprietary RAN signalling and data protocols would run over IP
unmodified. Indeed, both 3GPP and 3GPP2 (European and North American
3rd generation) cellular designs have hooks for IP as control transport 
in the RAN, though not for IP data transport.

Given these constraints, I am skeptical about replacing soft handoff
with either L3 (mobile IP or any of the pre-frame selection
micromobility proposals) or L7 (SIP) mechanisms. Should the radio
manufacturers and cellular operators desire it, it would be interesting to look
at an Open RAN protocol that would take the current proprietary soft handoff 
mechanisms and standardize them. But, for now, I think any IP mobility 
solutions need to be restricted to post frame selection, i.e. hard handoff 
only.

Note that the situation is different in TDMA systems like GSM. In that
case, there is no soft handoff and I believe that the mobile can
only be in contact with a maximum of two base stations at a time, and then only
until handoff is complete between one and the other.

Stephen, agreed that soft-hand  is mostly dealt with  at layer two, however if
the IP-enabled Mobile station  is moving between adjacent cells where each cell
belongs to a different subnet (subnet mobility) within a domain, soft-hand off
can be emulated (achieved) at layer 3 by using IP multicast from the immediate
first hop router within a domain, and layer two soft handoff may not be needed
at that point. Things would be bit different if each adjacent cell belongs to a
different domain however.

If we are using using SIP as a signaling mechanism for wireless end-points, it
could be used to trigger that soft-hand off emulation at the first hop router
level.

Ashutosh

Hi, Everyone:

My comments are as follows:

1. We are extending SIP to support mobility in the application layer. So,
SIP WG is the right place. The SIP WG is the only group that knows what to
do the SIP protocol in the application layer.

Let me provide another analogy. We are extending SIP to support QOS. That
does not mean that extension of SIP has to be done in the QOS WGs (DiffServ,
MPLS, etc).

Only SIP WG can ensure whether the extension of SIP to support mobility
remains within the framework SIP architecture because they are the expert in
this application layer protocol (not mobile IP or other WGs).

2. For other points, the technical justifications and contributions will
proof the fact. No personal opinion will help unless it is justified from
technical point of view. (Personally, I would be happy to do as much less
work as we could do to support mobility in SIP.)

Hope this will clarify further.

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy
AT&T

The SIP WG charter does not currently include mobility solutions in
it's scope. However mobility support will be a key aspect of evolving
networks and there is a specific WG in the IETF which deals with it -
Mobile IP.

The Mobile IP WG is currently debating multiple I-Ds that propose
handoffs at the network layer. If at all handoffs are to be moved to
upper layers (from link/physical layers) then it may be optimal to do
it at the network layer.

What should a registration server acting as a forking proxy do when it
receives a SIP OPTIONS message which resolves to 2 or more contacts?

Should it:

A. Respond with "300 Multiple Choices".
B. Fork the request off to the multiple choices and then relay the
   first received response back to the original requester?
C. Something else.

I suspect A, but I can't seem to find enough information in
RFC2543 to be certain.

Thanks,

<RRR> I would be happy to do so if possible because the less work is better.
Do the technical contributions support this?

The Mobile IP WG is currently debating multiple I-Ds that propose
handoffs at the network layer. If at all handoffs are to be moved to
upper layers (from link/physical layers) then it may be optimal to do
it at the network layer. 
<RRR> I would be happy to see the technical contributions how they provide
the solution in the link and/or application layer without affecting the SIP
layer. Even if the hand-off is provided in the lower layer, there are other
things as well - location updates. How this affects the SIP application
layer need to be seen. It appears the SIP layer will be involved as it is
seen from the present contributions.

Hi James,

Have you considered the SUBSCRIBE & NOTIFY methods ("SIP for Presence"
draft)? These methods can be used by a UA to request future notification of
specified asynchronous events (according to my understanding of it).  This
seems to be what you are wanting in a least a few of your bullets.

Cheers,

Robert.

Subject:	[SIP] SIP Info Method and IS-41 Cellular Signalling Protocol

I'm working on a design for replacing the IS-41 North American cellular
signalling protocol with IP protocols. I had a couple of questions about
how the SIP INFO method, or potentially another SIP method, might
be used.

1) In the introduction to draft-ietf-sip-info-method-03.txt, exchange
of radio signal strength information is explicitly mentioned as
an application of the SIP INFO method. The HandoffMeasurementRequest
and HandoffMeasurementRequest2 messages in IS-41 are sent by the anchor
Mobile Switching Center (MSC) to a potential serving MSC to obtain
information 
about the signal strength of a Mobile Station (MS) in order to determine
if the potential serving MSC is a better candidate for handling the
mobile's call (called "hard handoff" in cellular jargon). They could be 
replaced with a SIP INFO method. There are three problems:

	a) The radio information is always solicited by the anchor MSC,
	and from the ID, the SIP INFO method seems like it is 
	sent unsolicted. I suppose one could come up with two INFO
	methods, one to solicit the radio information and one to
	return it, but this seems like a hack somehow.
	
	b) In the ID, it explicitly states that the INFO method is 
	only applicable when there is a call in progress. Problem is,
	there isn't a call in progress between the anchor MSC and
	the serving MSC, that's why the anchor MSC is soliciting
	the radio quality information in the first place.
	
	c) The INFO method seems like it is meant to be sent between 
	SIP UAC's, while the HandoffMeasurementRequest(2) methods
	are primarily designed to be sent between network elements.
	A SIP replacement would probably be sent between the last hop SIP
	proxies acting as Call Agents (CAs) for the call, which replaces
	the MSC in an all IP network.

2) There are a bunch of IS-41 messages that involve transmitting
feature or other information between the MS's Home Location
Register (HLR) and the MS. These are initiated by either the serving
MSC or the HLR. Examples are InformationDirective, which is used
by the HLR to provide notifications to an idle MS, and FeatureRequest,
which sends particular features to a potentially idle MS (features
being things like messages or playing particular tones). Again, these
seem like candidates to replace with the SIP INFO message, but 
the potential lack of any call in progress would prohibit that.

The alternative I could see would be establishing a session in order
to then send the information via the INFO method, but that seems like
overkill. And in the case of HandoffMeasurementRequest(2), the
message isn't intended for a SIP UAC anyway.

Maybe SIP is the wrong protocol to consider, since it is dedicated
to setting up and maintaining sessions, and not to exchanging information
between network elements or between network elements and terminals?

Can anybody provide some guidance?

Hi,

I wanted to point out that you can use k= is a few different ways:

k=base64:<key here in base64>   which suffers from the problem your mention
k=prompt:  i don't know how this is supposed to work
k=<mumble>:<url>

the URL could use the https: scheme to grab a key.  while clearly 
suboptimal, this could work in a relatively secure fashion.  sorry that i 
don't remember what <mumble> is off the top of my head.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

Who is the "we" here?  To be specific, has this been formally included as a 
topic for the SIP WG?  If so, I doubt that anyone assumed soft-handoff 
would be considered as part of the scope of "mobility".

thanks,

I am quite pleased with the PDF version for its general readability.
However, there is one line in the PDF version of RFC2543bis which has me
confused. The definition of "hexpart" on page 18 goes `hexpart = hexseq
- hexseq :: [ hexseq ] - :: [ hexseq ]', although the hyphens are
actually elongated ones (octal code 227, outside the 7-bit ASCII
alphabet). Should there simply be vertical bars here?

The goal is NOT to replace soft hand-off with any L3 or L7 mechanisms,
but to devise L3 and/or L7 mobility mechanisms that utilize the soft hand-off
mechanism correctly (i.e., create multiple streams that satisfy delay jitter
requirements and contain identical information).

More work is needed before arriving at a conclusion.

Anders and Thomas,

I am cc-ing this to the mmusic list since SDP is involved here.

First, I would say that you probably shouldn't say that it is the 180
response that contains the key agreement information, as I think that any 
response containing SDP is likely to be suitable. (183 and 200)

Second, I like the mechanism described here regarding agreement on keys
for RTP level encryption. However, as there has been no responses in this
thread from the WG, I would like to bring attention from the WG to this
topic again, hoping for more interest this time.

Does anyone else have comments on this? I really would like to see some
more discussion in this topic. What about the SIP security team, any
thoughts in this direction?

How about writing an ID on this to specify it clearer?


The advantages I can see with the proposal are:
1) Works through NATs.
2) It could be made generic. I believe any need for negotiation between
caller and callee when agreeing on a session key or shared secret (like 
diffie-hellman) could be signaled this way.
3) No need to rely on an infra-structure for fetching of public keys.

Disadvantages:
1) Another extension to SIP/SDP ?
2) The same key is used in the streams caller->callee and 
callee->caller. There may be applications that need to have different
keys in each stream.


Regards
Lars

Yes; LaTeX error of omitting $'s...

Hi,

Who is the "we" here?  To be specific, has this been formally included as a 
topic for the SIP WG?  If so, I doubt that anyone assumed soft-handoff 
would be considered as part of the scope of "mobility".

<RRR> "We" means the members who are interested for extension of SIP to
support mobility as some discussion was held based on the internet draft in
the last IETF meeting. Yes, "soft-handoff" may not be a part of SIP mobility
if it does not affect the application (i.e., SIP) layer resources.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,
 I have a question regarding the behavior of proxy on receiving a CANCEL.
Consider, a forking Proxy received an INVITE and it forked and forwarded the
INVITE to multiple servers downstream, Now along comes a CANCEL from an
upstream client.  The proxy is supposed to fork and send the CANCEL to the
branches which have not yet responded.

How should the proxy react,
(a) if it already received a 2xx response from one of the downstream
branches, (This would be if the final response from the proxy to the
upstream client and the CANCEL crossed over each other.)
- I guess it should be 481 (Transaction not found)

(b) The proxy has not received  2xx nor 6xx from any branches.
Should the proxy send back a 2xx for the CANCEL  immediately and not care
how the downstream servers respond to the CANCEL that is forked by this
proxy, or should it wait till the unfinished branches respond to the forked
CANCEL and then depending on this result send back a CANCEL, i.e. the proxy
send back a 200 CANCEL upstream if the proxy receives a 2xx for all the
forked CANCEL from all it's branches, or maybe proxy the 2xx for INVITE, if
one of the branches respond with 200 for INVITE  ( cross over for the forked
INVITE and forked CANCEL in one of the proxy) and resonpond say 481 for the
CANCEL.

If the proxy responds immediately with 2xx for CANCEL, it is possible that
the initiating UAC receive both a 2xx for the CANCEL and 2xx for INVITE
(Taking into consideration , that if a Proxy receives a 2xx for INVITE from
one of the branches, after it has sent a 2xx for CANCEL upstream, it still
forwards the 2xx for the CANCEL to the upstream client). How does the UA
handle this case.


Sorry for not keeping it short, I tried to look up the rfc but could not
find it discussing the above scenario.

Thanks in advance,
Provin

Hi all,


Dear colleagues, I am following the SIP development and now regarding the 
mobility problem I would like to point out some situations in a SIP 
environment.

In all the cases treated till now all the SIP UA have the REGISTER 
capability and they can find using one or other way (DHCP, SLP) the closest 
registrar server to make the registration.

The problem here arise when we are dealing with a plain UA with the simplest 
capabilities (not including REGISTER). In this case how could notify the UA 
its location to other entities. How can be that UA available to others UA or 
proxies if it has not been registered anywhere?
This is the specific case when an IP device obtain its mobile address starts 
using it for other needs. Initially, it has assigned a mobile IP address for 
other matters and afterwards it launch the SIP UA in case someone wants to 
call him, but that UA has not been registered anywhere.

In the case that we have a complete implementation of the UA including the 
registration feature but the nearest SIP proxy does not have that 
capability, we find the same problem again.

In resume, I am wondering if there is any mean to locate an IP device 
independently if is for IP telephony, mail service, or whatever?

Any suggestion about any solution or clue about any working group related to 
these problems would be welcome.

Thanks
Best Regards
Jose

My general feeling is queasiness. Security protocols are hard to get
right. In general, wherever possible, I would prefer to use a real,
established, tested, and understood security protocol rather than try to
add one into SIP itself. In this case, we have numerous key exchange
protocols at our disposal, including IKE and kerberos.

Dear all,

I am new on the list and have a question regarding the status of the
following internet draft "SIP call control services"
(draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-cc-01.txt), which is  expired December 1999.

Is there a new version of the draft (or maybe other drafts covering the
ideas) planed or even already available?

I noticed that response 487 Request Cancelled is missing from the CANCEL
examples of the SIP Call Flows draft. I'm not sure whether this because the
call flows does not incorporate RFC2543bis or whether this is a genuine
omission.

Cheers,

Robert.

I am quite pleased with the PDF version for its general readability.
However, there is one line in the PDF version of RFC2543bis which has me
confused. The definition of "hexpart" on page 18 goes `hexpart = hexseq
- hexseq

=F6 [ hexseq ]', although the hyphens
 are
actually elongated ones (octal code 227, outside the 7-bit ASCII
alphabet). Should there simply be vertical bars here?

The goal is NOT to replace soft hand-off with any L3 or L7 mechanisms,
but to devise L3 and/or L7 mobility mechanisms that utilize the soft hand-off
mechanism correctly (i.e., create multiple streams that satisfy delay jitter
requirements and contain identical information).

More work is needed before arriving at a conclusion.

Anders and Thomas,

I am cc-ing this to the mmusic list since SDP is involved here.

First, I would say that you probably shouldn't say that it is the 180
response that contains the key agreement information, as I think that any
response containing SDP is likely to be suitable. (183 and 200)

Second, I like the mechanism described here regarding agreement on keys
for RTP level encryption. However, as there has been no responses in this
thread from the WG, I would like to bring attention from the WG to this
topic again, hoping for more interest this time.

Does anyone else have comments on this? I really would like to see some
more discussion in this topic. What about the SIP security team, any
thoughts in this direction?

How about writing an ID on this to specify it clearer?


The advantages I can see with the proposal are:
1) Works through NATs.
2) It could be made generic. I believe any need for negotiation between
caller and callee when agreeing on a session key or shared secret (like
diffie-hellman) could be signaled this way.
3) No need to rely on an infra-structure for fetching of public keys.

Disadvantages:
1) Another extension to SIP/SDP ?
2) The same key is used in the streams caller->callee and
callee->caller. There may be applications that need to have different
keys in each stream.

Hi,

Who is the "we" here?  To be specific, has this been formally included as a
topic for the SIP WG?  If so, I doubt that anyone assumed soft-handoff
would be considered as part of the scope of "mobility".

<RRR> "We" means the members who are interested for extension of SIP to
support mobility as some discussion was held based on the internet draft in
the last IETF meeting. Yes, "soft-handoff" may not be a part of SIP mobility
if it does not affect the application (i.e., SIP) layer resources.

thanks,
-rohan

Subject: [SIP] Proxy behavior for CANCEL



Hi,
 I have a question regarding the behavior of proxy on receiving a CANCEL.
Consider, a forking Proxy received an INVITE and it forked and forwarded the
INVITE to multiple servers downstream, Now along comes a CANCEL from an
upstream client.  The proxy is supposed to fork and send the CANCEL to the
branches which have not yet responded.

How should the proxy react,
(a) if it already received a 2xx response from one of the downstream
branches, (This would be if the final response from the proxy to the
upstream client and the CANCEL crossed over each other.)
- I guess it should be 481 (Transaction not found)

(b) The proxy has not received  2xx nor 6xx from any branches.
Should the proxy send back a 2xx for the CANCEL  immediately and not care
how the downstream servers respond to the CANCEL that is forked by this
proxy, or should it wait till the unfinished branches respond to the forked
CANCEL and then depending on this result send back a CANCEL, i.e. the proxy
send back a 200 CANCEL upstream if the proxy receives a 2xx for all the
forked CANCEL from all it's branches, or maybe proxy the 2xx for INVITE, if
one of the branches respond with 200 for INVITE  ( cross over for the forked
INVITE and forked CANCEL in one of the proxy) and resonpond say 481 for the
CANCEL.

If the proxy responds immediately with 2xx for CANCEL, it is possible that
the initiating UAC receive both a 2xx for the CANCEL and 2xx for INVITE
(Taking into consideration , that if a Proxy receives a 2xx for INVITE from
one of the branches, after it has sent a 2xx for CANCEL upstream, it still
forwards the 2xx for the CANCEL to the upstream client). How does the UA
handle this case.


Sorry for not keeping it short, I tried to look up the rfc but could not
find it discussing the above scenario.

Thanks in advance,
Provin

Hi,
My assumption is that a user "belongs" to a registrar server, the "home"
registrar server", that is operated by a service provider that is providing
the users SIP address. The SIP address points out the registrar server
through DNS for incoming INVITE messages. The problem is now how to forward
these messages to the users current location. This is done to by using the
information from for example a REGISTER message from the user. 

DHCP could be used to find registrar servers within the domain where the
user's phone currently is present. A useful scenario for this is when an ISP
is also acting as SIP service provider and wants to deploy phones to be used
on their access. Then could these phones get automatically configured via
the DHCP options and thereby get the address of their registrar server.

In the case when you have a UA implementing the REGISTER method but doesn't
know the nearest proxy you could assume that you know the address of your
home registrar server, analogous how you know about your mail server. This
information could be sent to you when you got the subscription, or
information on a SIM card etc. The register messages could be sent directly
to this network assumed that there is no firewalls in between. 

In the case of firewalls you first might have to contact a SIP server in the
domain where you currently are for authorization to let you through the
firewall. This server would then act as a proxy and forward your
registration message to your home registrar server. The proxy server in the
visited domain might be found with SLP or DHCP if you got the IP address
from this domain.

The case with a simple UA not implementing REGISTER could be solved if SIP
and mobile IP are provided by the same service provider. I am not a mobile
IP expert, so correct me if I am wrong...
The solution relies on either static mobile addresses per user or that there
is a server providing a dynamic mobile address that is fixed through the
whole mobile session, even when the user is moving around between networks.
In the first case could this static address be hard wired into the users
home registrar server the time the account is set up. In the second case
could the entity providing mobile addresses update the registrar server with
the current mobile address that an user is available on.

mne: Re:[SIP] SIP and soft hand-off


Hi all,


Dear colleagues, I am following the SIP development and now regarding the 
mobility problem I would like to point out some situations in a SIP 
environment.

In all the cases treated till now all the SIP UA have the REGISTER 
capability and they can find using one or other way (DHCP, SLP) the closest 
registrar server to make the registration.

The problem here arise when we are dealing with a plain UA with the simplest

capabilities (not including REGISTER). In this case how could notify the UA 
its location to other entities. How can be that UA available to others UA or

proxies if it has not been registered anywhere?
This is the specific case when an IP device obtain its mobile address starts

using it for other needs. Initially, it has assigned a mobile IP address for

other matters and afterwards it launch the SIP UA in case someone wants to 
call him, but that UA has not been registered anywhere.

In the case that we have a complete implementation of the UA including the 
registration feature but the nearest SIP proxy does not have that 
capability, we find the same problem again.

In resume, I am wondering if there is any mean to locate an IP device 
independently if is for IP telephony, mail service, or whatever?

Any suggestion about any solution or clue about any working group related to

these problems would be welcome.

Thanks
Best Regards
Jose

Hi,

Who is the "we" here?  To be specific, has this been formally included as a 
topic for the SIP WG?  If so, I doubt that anyone assumed soft-handoff 
would be considered as part of the scope of "mobility".

<RRR> "We" means the members who are interested for extension of SIP to
support mobility as some discussion was held based on the internet draft in
the last IETF meeting. Yes, "soft-handoff" may not be a part of SIP mobility
if it does not affect the application (i.e., SIP) layer.

thanks,
-rohan

Robert,

Thanks for the feedback - you are correct.  The 487 Request Cancelled response
to the INVITE should be added to scenarios 3.2.1, 4.2.1, 5.2.6, 7.7, and 7.10.

Thanks,
Alan Johnston

Hi Jorgen,

Thanks for your description for each case.
See my comments below.

 

> The case with a simple UA not implementing REGISTER could be solved if
>  SIP
> and mobile IP are provided by the same service provider. 

That is the particular case that I wanted point out, when ISP does not 
provide any SIP server and the UA don't have any way to advice its old proxy 
server that it has changed the location.

Thus, is there any other Location mechanism to locate this UA?

In the new location the UA has been assigned an IP address in a domain where 
there isn't any SIP proxy available and the UA does not have implemented the 
REGISTRAR feature.

Is it possible that ISP once has assigned the mobile IP address has any mean 
to locate the user device and its capabilities (UA or H.323 end device) and 
let others ISP know that this UA is on its domain?

Then, when any remote UA wants to set up the call to that UA it can address 
the signaling directly to the address assigned by the Local ISP to that UA.

Here we could have almost the same situation. If ISP providing mobile IP has 
not implemented SIP service, how can notify the UA local registrar that the 
UA is now on its domain?

Maybe I am too much exigent in deploying this scenarios but I just was 
wondering if exist any "Swiss Army Knife" mechanism to locate each user 
despite its situation and  Signaling protocol is using for setting up a 
phone call. Just locating the user location, IP address assigned and end 
device capabilities and then let know to other ISPs that it has that 
information available. Thus, that device would be globally available.

Thanks Jrgen for your help and let me know if you have any clue for this 
situation or there are any other working group that are working on that kind 
of issue.

Thanks a lot.

Best Regards
Jose

I think there's a terminology problem here. When layer 2 people talk about
mobility it means something different than when layer 3 people talk about
mobility, and still something different when layer 7 people talk about
mobility. What is common however, is the need to keep an application happy
in the face of changes in the underlying network connectivity.

- For layer 2 folks, this means keeping the mobility transparent to layer 3
and above in order to provide what looks like a homogenous topology to the
algorithms and protocols which run IP and other global protocols in layers
3, 4 and above. This of course works well in a single administrative domain,
scales only so far, and depends on pretty tight timing and a fair amount of
state.

- For layer 3 folks, this means keeping the logical connectivity seen by the
transport and above constant in order to keep the transport protocols
(especially TCP) happy. By extension this is needed to keep applications
which view transport failure as fatal or semi-fatal from thinking the world
has fallen apart when an IP address changes.

- For layer 7 folks, it just means that the application protocol can deal
with changes in connectivity, network address, and even in some cases,
complete disconnection from the network for extended periods of time (poster
child for this is disconnected file systems like Andrew and DFS, and offline
WEB caching by browsers).

What is (sadly) common among these is only:
1. each assumes that the layers above absolutely positively need
transparency or the world comes crashing down around their ears.
2. each assumes that the layers below can only deal with a subset of the
likely mobility scenarios, and hence are absolutely, positively sure that
they can't depend on the lower layer for performance, robustness, or
scalability reasons.

In the case of SIP, I believe the motivation for doing something to support
mobility directly is driven by:
a) not wanting to depend on Mobile IP in all devices and network
infrastructures. Beyond this, I suspect the dog-leg routing and tunneling
needed by at least the MobileIPv4 approach is viewed as having significant
performance problems for the kind of real time traffic sessions set up by
SIP
b) wanting to have "global" mobility - completely independent of current
network connectivity, administrative boundaries, etc.
c) wanting to potentially deal with mobility at a semantic level above that
of the IP host (e.g. moving a media stream from one device to another).

I don't want to make a value judgement on the validity or relative
importance of these motivations, except to make the observation that the
end-to-end argument has shown again and again its power and general
superiority. It's been true for error control, flow/congestion control,
security, and many of the "ubiquitous" features of computer networks. For me
that says that applications wanting to support mobility in a flexible and
general way will want to have their own mechanisms, but to exploit lower
layer mechanisms AS OPTIMIZATIONS when they are available.

This is NOT precisely true. We specifically did *NOT* extend SIP to support
QoS. That would have been a bad thing to do. What we did instead is allowed
SIP to convey information used to control the lower layer QoS mechanisms,
and to synchronize session establishment with results of QoS signaling
operations.
Perhaps we can use this as guidance for at least the kind of mobility
mentioned in (b) above.

This depends on just what one views as the scope of "mobility" as seen by
SIP. God help us if we try to use SIP as a general hammer to pound on the
mobility nail. I can easily see how folks not close to SIP or its domain of
applicability could draw scary conclusions.

several times. For some reason, the IE5 browser appears to be ignoring the
../../ on the links. Sometimes. I've managed to reproduce it a couple of
times but not consistently. I have not been able to repro with Netscape. I
don't understand. If anybody figures it out, let me know.

I have observed that if I navigate in a stepwise fashion -- that is, go to
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/ them go to teams, then go to call control, I
can read the drafts without difficulty.

I'll dig into it as time permits. In the interim, if you are having
difficulty with the links, try either a stepwise navigation as above (which
works for me), back up to the "teams" level and work back down, or just use
the draft name given as an index into either the "drafts" directory or into
the IETF web site for drafts.

Subject: [SIP] OPTIONS behaviour with forking proxy

What should a registration server acting as a forking proxy do when it
receives a SIP OPTIONS message which resolves to 2 or more contacts?

Should it:

A. Respond with "300 Multiple Choices".
B. Fork the request off to the multiple choices and then relay the
   first received response back to the original requester?
C. Something else.

I suspect A, but I can't seem to find enough information in
RFC2543 to be certain.

Thanks,
Mark

I figured it out.

The problem is the trailing / I inadvertently left on the published link. It
appears to glitch out the version of Apache used by the ISP hosting the
page.

try:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/teams/callcontrol/index.html

instead.

Some days, I realize how much I've already foggotten and wonder if there's
anything left at all.

During the SIP bake-off, two SDP-related issues were raised:

Currently, s= is defined as text, which is 1*(some set of bytes), i.e.,
at least one character. It doesn't seem necessary to enforce that s=
have anything in them (like a space). Other textual Internet protocols
seem to be fine with having empty unformatted fields (like Subject: in
email).

Secondly, the rtpmap description does not specify whether the 'encoding
name' is case-sensitive or not. Since it's also used as a media type and
media types are case-insensitive (RFC 2616, 3.7), it probably makes
sense to make them CI in SDP as well.

Comments are appreciated.

Henning

OPTIONS isn't any different from any other method...you fork the request off
to every registered location, and send back all the 2xx-class responses or
the first failure response you get.

This means that people who send OPTIONS requests need to expect to get
multiple 2xx responses, of course.

The following issues were discussed at the SIP bake-off. Comments from
the list are appreciated. 'Suggested solution' is the preference
expressed by the bake-off attendees.

1) SDP case-sensitivity for encodings (see previous message)

Suggested solution: case-insensitive (possibly with upper-case as the
canonical version)

2) tag: currently is hex, should token be allowed?

Suggested solution: yes, token should be allowed.

3) REGISTER authentication

Some suggested that proxy-authorization should be used instead of
Authorization for REGISTER. Text needs to be clarified but consensus was
that Authorization is to be used (if a proxy, real or co-located also
wants the client to authenticate, it is free to return a 407 and the
client should use the same mechanism to return Proxy-Authorization).

4) Digest quoting of URIs

RFC 2617 is inconsistent. The BNF specifies that URIs are appended as
arguments, while the example in RFC 2617, Section 3.5 encloses them in
quotation marks. The latter is considered correct since the URI may
contain non-token characters.

5) From/To header

Some implementations do not put a space between the display name and the
'<'. This is legal, if unusual.

6) Expires header

If a new registration has a shorter expiration date, it updates the old
one.

7) Multicast INVITE/REGISTER

It was suggested to include a maddr in the Via header containing the
multicast address. This makes it easier for the server to tell that the
request was received via multicast (since sockets may receive both
unicast and multicast packets).

8) Overlapping transactions

A number of people expressed unhappiness about not allowing overlapping
transactions as it greatly complicates the client state machine for
things like hold/mute. This may need to be discussed again. Maybe
limiting this restriction to media list changes would address most of
the concerns.

9) Status code for non-matching media (in SDP)

Currently, we have 606 for "Not Acceptable", but this terminates
searches. Thus, it was suggested that we may want to add a 488 code for
incompatibility at an individual terminal (which allows the proxy to
search elsewhere for matching media).

10) Record-Route

It was suggested that UAS should reflect all Record-Route headers into
Route headers, as that might simplify implementation of future features.
This is already implied by the current wording in 6.33.2.

Henning:

In reply to the first SDP issue (s=nothing):

*	According to RFC 2327 s= is a required SDP parameter. Is it the
intention of the spec writers
      to allow nothing to be sent?
*	If so, then should s= even be a required SDP parameter?
*	If s=nothing is permitted, then the fact that s= was present in the
SDP message must be recorded
      in order to adhere to the requirement that s= was indeed in the SDP
message.
*	If an SDP parser is strictly compliant, it will complain about the
s=nothing scenario.
*	SDP parameters are required to appear in a specific order. This
possibly presents
      issues, if a SDP parser strictly validates, depending on how it deals
with the above issue.
*	Section B7, RFC 2543, says that for two-party sessions, the SDP s=
parameter may be left empty. 
      Isn't this in conflict with RFC 2327? However, in the case of
multicast sessions it has to be s=something. 
*	Having the s= parameter follow a varying rule set seems to add an
unnecessary complication for
      SDP message validation.

Comments appreciated. Thanks.

Bill Lee

One slightly more complex case would be where the user has bought his SIP
address from a vanity name provider, and the vanity name provider forwards all
requests on to his real SIP server, which is the server he registers with.

Hi,
My assumption is that a user "belongs" to a registrar server, the "home"
registrar server", that is operated by a service provider that is providing
the users SIP address. The SIP address points out the registrar server
through DNS for incoming INVITE messages. The problem is now how to forward
these messages to the users current location. This is done to by using the
information from for example a REGISTER message from the user.

DHCP could be used to find registrar servers within the domain where the
user's phone currently is present. A useful scenario for this is when an ISP
is also acting as SIP service provider and wants to deploy phones to be used
on their access. Then could these phones get automatically configured via
the DHCP options and thereby get the address of their registrar server.

In the case when you have a UA implementing the REGISTER method but doesn't
know the nearest proxy you could assume that you know the address of your
home registrar server, analogous how you know about your mail server. This
information could be sent to you when you got the subscription, or
information on a SIM card etc. The register messages could be sent directly
to this network assumed that there is no firewalls in between.

In the case of firewalls you first might have to contact a SIP server in the
domain where you currently are for authorization to let you through the
firewall. This server would then act as a proxy and forward your
registration message to your home registrar server. The proxy server in the
visited domain might be found with SLP or DHCP if you got the IP address
from this domain.

The case with a simple UA not implementing REGISTER could be solved if SIP
and mobile IP are provided by the same service provider. I am not a mobile
IP expert, so correct me if I am wrong...
The solution relies on either static mobile addresses per user or that there
is a server providing a dynamic mobile address that is fixed through the
whole mobile session, even when the user is moving around between networks.
In the first case could this static address be hard wired into the users
home registrar server the time the account is set up. In the second case
could the entity providing mobile addresses update the registrar server with
the current mobile address that an user is available on.

=C4mne: Re:[SIP] SIP and soft hand-off


Hi all,


Dear colleagues, I am following the SIP development and now regarding t=
he
mobility problem I would like to point out some situations in a SIP
environment.

In all the cases treated till now all the SIP UA have the REGISTER
capability and they can find using one or other way (DHCP, SLP) the clo=
sest
registrar server to make the registration.

The problem here arise when we are dealing with a plain UA with the sim=
plest

capabilities (not including REGISTER). In this case how could notify th=
e UA
its location to other entities. How can be that UA available to others =
UA or

proxies if it has not been registered anywhere?
This is the specific case when an IP device obtain its mobile address s=
tarts

using it for other needs. Initially, it has assigned a mobile IP addres=
s for

other matters and afterwards it launch the SIP UA in case someone wants=
 to
call him, but that UA has not been registered anywhere.

In the case that we have a complete implementation of the UA including =
the
registration feature but the nearest SIP proxy does not have that
capability, we find the same problem again.

In resume, I am wondering if there is any mean to locate an IP device
independently if is for IP telephony, mail service, or whatever?

Any suggestion about any solution or clue about any working group relat=

Probably best discussed on the confctrl mailing list. However, all other
protocols and standard C/C++ coding convention is that the empty string
("") is always legal as input. Clearly, for positional parameters, this
does not work, but for things like s=, it makes no difference. It is
annoying to have to remember everywhere to code

if (strlen(s) == 0) {
  free(s);
  s = strdup(" ");
}
sprintf(sdp, "s=%s", s);

or similar.

I would say that it shouldn't (and I suspect that many implementations
don't send it).

I doubt that any existing implementations break on that. If they do,
they are not going to work well in practice...

Ruling out in a protocol what robust implementations need to do anyway
seems like a futile exercise. The only difference is that difficulties
are detected later, in the field...

I would think that making s= optional and (certainly) allowing the null
string as an argument to s= seems in the spirit of all other Internet
text protocols, beyond the reasons mentioned above.

I'd like to make those individuals interested in PSTN-SIP interworking aware
of a new Draft.  And initiate a discussion on the topic described.

This draft proposes a method by which a SIP application can request Media
Gateway event detection and reporting, via the MG's Media Gateway
Controller.  A primary application is to enable DTMF collection but all MG
event related capabilities are supported.  Both MGCP and Megaco protocols
are described.

Comments, corrections, and criticism are welcome.

Thanks,
Bert

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


	Title		: SIP INFO Method for Event Reporting
	Author(s)	: V. Bharatia, E. Cave, B. Culpepper
	Filename	: draft-culpepper-sip-info-event-00.txt
	Pages		: 10
	Date		: 19-Apr-00
	
This document describes the use of the SIP INFO Method for
communicating mid-call events in SIP [1] sessions.  Two new MIME
types are described, according to the rules defined in RFC 2046 [2],
for use in the INFO message.  These media types can be used within a
SIP INFO message to request, and report, event detection between SIP
network entities.  Emphasis is placed on DTMF signaling to
communicate user indications when using SIP between a Media Gateway
Controller (MGC) and a SIP application.

It should send back a 200 OK; no error occurred in this case. 481 is
sent when the proxy receives a CANCEL for a transaction it doesn't know
anything about. Note that the CANCEL still needs to be proxied even in
the latter case.

Yes. CANCEL requests are hop-by-hop.

Absolutely. The spec actually says that the UACs must be prepared to
handle this.

See sections 4.2.5, 12.4 in 2543bis.

Any half-way robust implementation needs to be able to deal with missing
s= and with s= followed by nothing. Might as well get the benefit of
allowing it officially.

Just to be clear here - you send back all 200's, or you send the best
response presuming there are no 200's. The best response isn't
necessarily the first failure response.

Also, just like any other method, the server could alternately redirect
instead of forking, option A above.

There was another issue raised; SDP says very little overall about case
sensitivity. The type (m=, s=, etc.) is case sensitive, and the values
depend on the type. The only types which discuss case sensitivity are:

1. t and r, which indicate that the d,h,m,s (days, hour, minutes,
seconds) characters are case sensitive.
2. a=charset:, which uses case insensitive matching for the character
set.

So, we also agreed that in the spirit of SDP, all other values are CASE
SENSITIVE unless otherwise noted. This includes the encoding name
Henning mentions below, which, along with the character set, represent
the only two case insensitive matches in SDP (I believe).

The only place there MUST appear LWS is between tokens. Since > is a
separator, according to this paragraph,  LWS can appear, but not MUST
appear.

Note that this is consistent with the Expires:0 operation; the reason we
did Expires:0 to erase registrations is that it didn't require special
case treatment for enabling removal. Thus, an implementation which does
not currently have code to special case 0 should work this way already.

This is already specified in rfc2543:

The text should be clarified in that it only says this for proxy. Its
also true for a UAC.

An implementation can send any 400 code, in fact, and just change the
reason phrase. No need to wait for an additional response code for
people to begin doing this.

Actually, I had a different interpretation of 504. 504 is when a proxy
tries to contact some other service, like a location server, and that
service does not respond. Thats why its a server failure; the other
service represents part of the operation of the server itself (many
folks include the location service within the proxy, for example). Thats
why its 500 class.

Also, I agree with Igor that 408 is used when a proxy gives up. Be
warned about this, however. Lets say a proxy forwards some request, gets
a 100. It then times out, and sends a 408. Unfortunately, the next hop
server then responds with a 300. Kind of too late... THe ideal solution
here is that when the timer expires, the proxy sends a CANCEL. This
should cause an almost immediate final response to the original request,
which can then be forwarded, or a 408 generated. This is safer, in the
sense that the server knows what the response from downstream is. Of
course, it gets more complicated if the CANCEL does not generate a
response to the original request. In this case, you are dealing with (1)
a UA which does not respond to the original request with 487 upon
receiving CANCEL, since you do not have to according to rfc2543, or (2)
some kind of downstream failure. In either case, you are much safer in
generating the 408.

Hi,

in case replies are sent by a server UA via several TCP connections 
(for example, a new connection is created for each message) close 
out of which of the connetions must be treated by a client UA as 
CANCEL in case the transaction is not complete?

Thank you for your responce.

Absolutely correct. The big difference between 400 and 600 is search
termination.

Hmm. This is a good point. Given the increasing use of tel URLs, its
probably worth changing this in rfc2543bis. This doesn't introduce
backwards compatibility problems; it just means that calls to UAs
compliant to the bis version will get set up successfully, when they
won't with rfc2543.

In general, the *request URI* is what is important in processing a
request. The To field is used only for (1) call leg identification
(along with From and Call-ID), and (2) FYI to the called party. The
request URI represents the desired user at the server being contacted.
The To field may contain a URI which is meaningless within the namespace
served by the server. 


Thanks for putting these lessons learned together. They should be
incorporated into the FAQ.

The server should not open a new connection to send a response if one is
already open. You should not be opening a new connection for each
response.

As a result, it is the original connection the request was sent on,
that, if closed, implies CANCEL.

Duh. Of all the sentences in the spec I miss, somehow its this one. My
apologies. I'm glad at least the recommended clarification we made fits
with whats actually in the spec :)

Hi all

I have a small doubt in the concept.

There has recently been some discussion on the way to
do message waiting indication (mwi) using SUBSCRIBE/
NOTIFY SIP extensions.  However, I am not aware of
any proposals to for specifying waiting message list
summary, supplied in mwi NOTIFY message.  In other
words, there is no proposed way to supply the summary
of messages being available in the voice mail system.

So I would like to submit a brief sample proposal to
do
message waiting indication with message summary using
SIP
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.  This is based on the recent
SUBSCSRIBE/
NOTIFY IETF draft:
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-00.txt

The main purpose of this proposal is to start the
discussion
on the topic with the aim of eventually submitting an
Inf. Draft.

1. Subscription
----------------
Event field specifies "mwi" field (message waiting
indication).
There is no message body.

SUBSCRIBE ...
To:             ...
From:           ...
Call-ID:        ...
CSeq:           ...
Contact:        ...
Expires:        ...
Event:          mwi
Content-Length: 0

2. Notification
-----------------
Event field specifies "mwi".
Message body specifies the message summary.

NOTIFY
To:             ...
From:           ...
Call-ID:        ...
CSeq:           ...
Contact:        ...
Expires:        ...
Event:          mwi
Content-Type:   application/um
Content-Length: 148

VOICEMAIL: <TOTAL_MESSAGES>; U:n1/n2; S:n1/n2;
F:n1/n2; R:n1/n2; A:n1/n2; D:n1/n2
EMAIL:     <TOTAL_MESSAGES>; U:n1/n2; S:n1/n2;
F:n1/n2; R:n1/n2; A:n1/n2; D:n1/n2
FAX:       <TOTAL_MESSAGES>; U:n1/n2; S:n1/n2;
F:n1/n2; R:n1/n2; A:n1/n2; D:n1/n2
VIDEO:     <TOTAL_MESSAGES>; U:n1/n2; S:n1/n2;
F:n1/n2; R:n1/n2; A:n1/n2; D:n1/n2

where TOTAL_MESSAGES, n1, n2 are integers
U = UNTOUCHED
S = SKIPPED
F = FLAGGED
R = READ
A = ANSWERED
D = DELETED

For example:
voicemail: 10; U:3/1; S:1/0; F:0/0; R:5/2; A:1/0;
D:0/0
where U: 3/1  indicates that there are 3 untouched
messages, 1 of which is urgent.

More formal grammar for the application/um message
body:

application_um_message_body = message_summary_list
message_summary_list = message_summary "\n"
message_summary_list | NULL
message_summary = message_type ": " total_messages ";
" typed_summary_list
message_type = "VOICEMAIL" | "EMAIL" | "FAX" | "VIDEO"
total_messages = INTEGER
typed_summary_list = typed_summary ";"
typed_summary_list | NULL
typed_summary = type ":" number_of_messages "/"
number_of_urgent_messages
type = "U" | "S" | "F" | "R" | "A" | "D"
number_of_messages = INTEGER
number_of_urgent_messages = INTEGER

I'm confused by this last paragraph.  First you say all 'other' values are 
CASE SENSITIVE.  Then you say that encoding name, along with the character 
set represent the only two case insensitive matches.

So are you agreeing that <encoding name> from a=rtpmap and <media> from m= 
should be CASE INSENSITIVE?  Or are you saying that since SDP is silent on 
the case sensitivity of <encoding name> and <media> that they should be 
CASE SENSITIVE?

I agree with Henning's suggestion below that since <media> and <encoding 
name> form a media type and media types are CASE INSENSITIVE, that <media> 
and <encoding name> should also be CASE INSENSITIVE.

RFC 2367 states:

   An SDP session description consists of a number of lines of text of
   the form <type>=<value> <type> is always exactly one character and is
   case-significant.  <value> is a structured text string whose format
   depends on <type>.  It also will be case-significant unless a
   specific field defines otherwise.

The only place where RFC 2367 states that something is case-insentive
is in the case of the charset attribute.

By default, this means that attributes are case-sensitive unless
specified otherwise, and all other fields are case-sensitive.

In the case of the rtpmap attribute, the issue of the meaning of
encoding names is punted to the relevant RTP profile spec.  As far as
SDP is concerned, they're case _sensitive_ by virtue of not specifying
otherwise.  However, the RTP AV profile specifies that the encoding
name is a MIME subtype, and I believe MIME specifies that subtypes are
not case sensitive.  Hence when rtpmap is used with protocol "RTP/AVP"
(and it's not currently specified for any other protocol), then
although the SDP string is case-sensitive to the SDP parser, it makes
sense to treat the encoding name as case-insensitive.  The rest of the
rtpmap attribute would still be case-sensitive.

BTW RFC 2327 also specifies:

   SDP session descriptions are entirely textual using the ISO 10646
   character set in UTF-8 encoding. SDP field names and attributes names
   use only the US-ASCII subset of UTF-8, but textual fields and
   attribute values may use the full ISO 10646 character set.

Thus the rtpmap attribute (with the exception of the attribute name
("rtpmap") itself) is also in ISO 10646 UTF 8.  However, the encoding
name is going to have to be in the US ASCII subset of ISO 10646 UTF 8
to be a valid MIME subtype, although the SDP syntax allows non-ASCII
encoding names.  

The key point is that SDP doesn't specify how to interpret the
encoding-name at all.  The RTP AV profile specifies this, and so adds
additional semantics to the basic SDP syntax.  

Cheers,
	Mark

Whatever you might wish the SDP spec would say, it's fairly clear on
this issue: if there's no s= line, you should treat the SDP as
corrupted and act accordingly.  If you send SDP without the s= line,
you are definitely not compliant with RFC 2327 and shouldn't expect
your message to be accepted.

Changing the spec at this stage would introduce backward compatibility
issues, so should not be done lightly.  The more incompatible changes
we introduce, the less likely we are to be able to move SDP (and hence
SIP and RTSP) to Draft Standard without cycling it at Proposed
Standard first.

Cheers,
	Mark

Sounds like s= might as well be optional then.  There's already a great 
deal of flexibility in SDP that makes interoperation difficult.  The field 
is marked as required in the spec and the grammar for "text" is clearly 1 
or more.  I don't see a compelling reason to change this.

I completely agree with this clarification.  We have always treated it as 
case-insensitive and a consistent interpretation is needed for interoperation.

Thanks for the clarification.

When moving to Draft,  the ABNF should be made consistent with the main 
text in regards to case-sensitivity.

RFC2234 (ABNF) states:
"NOTE:     ABNF strings are case-insensitive and
            the character set for these strings is us-ascii."

An example of the change needed in the ABNF is:
      attribute-fields =    *("a=" attribute CRLF)
should be:
      attribute-fields =    *(%x61 attribute CRLF)

Are you sure that applies to the protocol specified by the grammar or
just to the tokens within the ABNF, so that "CRLF" and "crlf" are
equivalent?

These days, I'm not "sure" of much of anything. :-)

I don't believe RFC2234 is very clear on this issue either.
However, if you look at page 5 under "Concatenation" there is this example:

----begin quote----
    A rule can define a simple, ordered string of values -- i.e., a
    concatenation of contiguous characters -- by listing a sequence of
    rule names.  For example:

         foo         =  %x61           ; a

         bar         =  %x62           ; b

         mumble      =  foo bar foo

         So that the rule <mumble> matches the lowercase string "aba".
----end quote----

Current (modified) wording is:

The server could not produce a response, e.g., a user location, within
the time indicated in the \header{Expires} request-header field.  The
client {\MAY} repeat the request without modifications at any later
time.

Please suggest improvements.

What we are seeing here is a conflict between SAP and SIP. SDP was
originally designed for the multicast session directory programs (sd, sdr)
that use a session id to correlate advertizements from multiple possible
announcers. If you do that, then you need a very complete and autonomous
session description, including session-id and timing parameters.

SDP is then used in SIP (and also MGCP and Megaco) as a way to describe and
negotiate the characteristics of a "private session." If the beginning and
end of the sessions are bracketed by the INVITE and BYE requests, if the
sessions are identified by a SIP "Call-id," then the SDP level session
identifiers and timing indicators are somewhat redundant.

What we probably need is a profile of some sort, that qualifies what is
mandatory and when. For example, I believe that a fully formed "s=" field
MUST be present when announcements of multicast sessions are multicast in
SAP. The same requirement would logically apply when invitations to the same
sessions are sent via SIP. But the requirement is not all that logical for
invitations to ephemeral point to point sessions -- the robustness principle
would dictate that inviters SHOULD fill up a session field, but that
invitees should not reject invitations to point to point sessions when the
"s=" field is absent.

I have no problem with this model; it does, however, require that
the description of 408 be updated in RFC2543bis.

The server could not produce a response, e.g., a user location, within
a suitable amount of time.  This may be due to the time indicated in the
\header{Expires} request-header field or by the expiration of an internal
timer in the server.  The client {\MAY} repeat the request without 
modifications at any later time.

I had originally planned to do this but ran out of time. I will include
one in the next draft. I'd appreciate any INFO call flows that anyone
would like to contribute with message details - especially involving
PSTN interworking.

Can someone please clarify the behavior in the following scenarios :

1) Stateful proxy server returns a final response upstream.
Now it receives a CANCEL request. Should it return a 481 response ??

2) Stateful forking proxy server returns a 200 response to INVITE upstream
and receives another 200 OK from downstream. Should it return this second
200 OK upstream or it is a configuration issue ??

3) Stateful forking proxy server is waiting for a final response on forked
"branches" and meanwhile receives a CANCEL. It returns a 200 OK upstream
and generates locally generated CANCEL requests for pending branches. Now it
receives a 200 response to original request. Should it just drop this
response ??

It may return a 481. However, it should still try to proxy the CANCEL
upstream, I believe.

It should proxy the second 200 OK upstream.

No way. It should proxy the 200 OK upstream (see sec 4.2.5 of
RFC2543bis).

Hi all
nara and Glenn cleared some of my doubts and now i can place SIP in the =
picture in an MGCP media transfer.I have another small doubt.Basically i =
am very new to SIP and  MGCP.Let me give you a very simple scenario.
You have a media gateway which just gets a media stream in analog form =
from a source connected to the media gateway .This media gateway =
transfers the media stream using MGCP and the call agent to a distant =
location where another media gateway of the same vendor is located .This =
media gateway then routes the media stream to some destination in analog =
form.This is the most simplest scenario i could think of.
I think you need to have two call agents residing near the two media =
gateways since they are geographically very far.=20
Now in the above case the vendors of the media gateway are the same and =
there is no need of any SS7 signalling as the endpoints are simple =
analog sources connected by twisted pair wires to the gateway.
Now in this case Is there any need of SIP between the two call agents ?

regards
Hiren

Actually, I think the proxy will generate a 200 OK to to the CANCEL.
There was no error; the CANCEL was received for a valid transaction. 

As for proxying it upstream, if the proxy returned a final response
already, there should either be no pending branches, or a CANCEL was
already sent to cancel pending branches. In that case, there is no need
to proxy the CANCEL.

Yes. In general, a proxy should never absorb 200 OK.

Igor is correct. Remember, CANCEL is meant to "speed up" completion of
the original request. So, after sending a CANCEL, you should still be
prepared for any set of responses you might get, just as if you had
never sent the CANCEL in the first place.

Hi all
nara and hemant have really cleared my doubts regarding the use of SIP in
MGCP
protocol.Thanks a lot.
This is a bit off the line but can anyone direct me to a MGCP discussion
forum.
Basically i am doing some research in MGCP and SIP.

regards
Hiren

Hi all
nara and hemant have really cleared my doubts regarding the use of SIP in
MGCP
protocol.Thanks a lot.
This is a bit off the line but can anyone direct me to a MGCP discussion
forum.
Basically i am doing some research in MGCP and SIP.

regards
Hiren

If you need two call agents, then they must communicate.  What protocol
would you choose?
 
If the call agents come from one vendor, then they may of course use a
proprietary protocol.
However, the network operator may wish to have the CAs use a standard
protocol.  There are
several choices - ISUP/SS7 is one choice, especially the Q.BICC variant.
H.323 is another
choice.  SIP is yet another choice.  
 
You started out assuming you wanted a Media Gateway/Media Gateway Controller
architecture.
That may be very appropriate for some kinds of gateways, but "intelligent"
devices may be
more appropriate for other kinds of endpoints.  Complex systems may have
both kinds in the network.  One of the nice characteristics of sip is that
you can build quite simple UAs, or
quite complex UA/Server combinations.  This is less true of some other
protocol choices.
 
One other statement you made bothers me  you implied that the distance
between the gateways
was the reason you needed two call agents.  This should not be true -
distance is not an important
factor in deciding what Call Agent should control what Gateways.  Such
decisions may take into
account administrative boundaries, network bandwidth, CA capacity, and
network topology.
In a simple case as you describe, one CA may be very appropriate.  
 
Brian

Hi all
nara and Glenn cleared some of my doubts and now i can place SIP in the
picture in an MGCP media transfer.I have another small doubt.Basically i am
very new to SIP and  MGCP.Let me give you a very simple scenario.
You have a media gateway which just gets a media stream in analog form from
a source connected to the media gateway .This media gateway transfers the
media stream using MGCP and the call agent to a distant location where
another media gateway of the same vendor is located .This media gateway then
routes the media stream to some destination in analog form.This is the most
simplest scenario i could think of.
I think you need to have two call agents residing near the two media
gateways since they are geographically very far. 
Now in the above case the vendors of the media gateway are the same and
there is no need of any SS7 signalling as the endpoints are simple analog
sources connected by twisted pair wires to the gateway.
Now in this case Is there any need of SIP between the two call agents ?
 
regards
Hiren

All,

Some drafts like draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt (SIP Telephony Call
Flow Examples) and draft-mark-sip-dmcs-00.txt (Distributed Multipoint
Conferences using SIP) use the Also and Requested-By header fields to
allow conferencing features. But I did not find out where these fields

All,

Some drafts like draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt (SIP Telephony Call
Flow Examples) and draft-mark-sip-dmcs-00.txt (Distributed Multipoint
Conferences using SIP) use the Also and Requested-By header fields to
allow conferencing features. But I did not find out where these fields
are specified. Even in the last RFC2543bis (April 2000) these fields are
not described.

Can someone tell me which document specifies these header fields ?

These fields were defined in the original call control draft:
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jdrosen/papers/draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-cc-01.txt

which has now expired. The group decided that the scope of this was too
large, and so has decided to attack the problem differently. Transfer is
split out, and is now described in:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-sparks-sip-cc-transfer-00.txt

a new draft on distributed multiparty conferencing is pending.

Softswitches run into a similar issue and SIP BCP-T is used for inter softswitch communication. One advantage of using SIP BCP-T is that it allows intelligent terminals to hook up with the network elements and have control of the call which is vital for providing enhanced services. Moreover, for intelligent services, you need to be able to exchange information during the call - esp. DTMF. 

The following draft addresses "in-call" event notification issues like DTMF notification:

If you need two call agents, then they must communicate.  What protocol
would you choose?
 
If the call agents come from one vendor, then they may of course use a
proprietary protocol.
However, the network operator may wish to have the CAs use a standard
protocol.  There are
several choices - ISUP/SS7 is one choice, especially the Q.BICC variant.
H.323 is another
choice.  SIP is yet another choice.  
 
You started out assuming you wanted a Media Gateway/Media Gateway Controller
architecture.
That may be very appropriate for some kinds of gateways, but "intelligent"
devices may be
more appropriate for other kinds of endpoints.  Complex systems may have
both kinds in the network.  One of the nice characteristics of sip is that
you can build quite simple UAs, or
quite complex UA/Server combinations.  This is less true of some other
protocol choices.
 
One other statement you made bothers me  you implied that the distance
between the gateways
was the reason you needed two call agents.  This should not be true -
distance is not an important
factor in deciding what Call Agent should control what Gateways.  Such
decisions may take into
account administrative boundaries, network bandwidth, CA capacity, and
network topology.
In a simple case as you describe, one CA may be very appropriate.

Hi all
nara and Glenn cleared some of my doubts and now i can place SIP in the
picture in an MGCP media transfer.I have another small doubt.Basically i am
very new to SIP and  MGCP.Let me give you a very simple scenario.
You have a media gateway which just gets a media stream in analog form from
a source connected to the media gateway .This media gateway transfers the
media stream using MGCP and the call agent to a distant location where
another media gateway of the same vendor is located .This media gateway then
routes the media stream to some destination in analog form.This is the most
simplest scenario i could think of.
I think you need to have two call agents residing near the two media
gateways since they are geographically very far. 
Now in the above case the vendors of the media gateway are the same and
there is no need of any SS7 signalling as the endpoints are simple analog
sources connected by twisted pair wires to the gateway.
Now in this case Is there any need of SIP between the two call agents ?
 
regards
Hiren

SIP is the Session *Initiation* Protocol, it was not originally
intended for signalling between network elements outside of the
context of setting up a multimedia session. ISUP/SS7 is awkward in
an all-IP network, I`m not all that familiar with H.323.

My understanding is that Megaco is primarily for "dumb"
endpoints, and SIP is for "smart" endpoints. 

This discussion brings up an issue that I'm encountering in my work
with 3rd generation cellular systems. There is need for a signalling
protocol between network elements, like SIP proxies as call agents
or a SIP proxy/call agent and a "smart" IP-based cell phone, outside
of the context of setting up a multimedia session. An example in
the cell phone world is paging to determine whether a cell phone
happens to be in a particular service area. Or having an
intelligent IP cell phone retrieve authentication credentials from 
a proxy, so it can authenticate incoming INVITEs, before any
call is in progress.

There are ways that one could force these situations into a SIP
context, like setting up a multimedia session to perform the operation,
then using a SIP INFO method to transfer the data or perform the
operation, but these seem somewhat forced, like a hack. Despite this, some
people are forging ahead with this anyway due to lack of a better solution. 
Megaco doesn't seem like the right solution either, if its intended use 
primarily covers controlling media gateways for "dumb" devices. Most cell phones 
these days are pretty intelligent, and since 3GPP has decided to standardize on 
SIP for a future all-IP cell phone, cell phones are likely to become even more 
intelligent as they move to using IP for signalling and voice services as well
as for data.

So the question is what to do? Should these functions simply be left to
proprietary protocols? Is there need for another protocol that is 
specifically designed for signalling between network elements, like
proxies, to cover these cases? Or should SIP be somehow expanded
to cover them? 

My opinion is that proprietary protocols are not appropriate, since
most of these functions are covered by standardized protocols in
the current SS7 based network, so this would be a step backwards.
Since I generally like to keep protocols well focussed and therefore
hopefully simple, expanding out SIP to handle these cases seems 
fraught with potential featurization peril. On the other hand,
it is unclear to me whether there are enough cases to cover
having a new protocol.

Comments?

Maybe this isn't the right list to explore this issue (if so, please
tell me to get lost)?

It might be helpful to describe those things that are different for
"network element" signaling and what information needs to be conveyed. I
don't see (yet) why this needs to be a hack, but I would stay away from
"let's just use the INFO hammer" approach.

I wouldn't read too much into a protocol name. This is more of a
historical accident than a political platform. As far as I can tell, SIP
should be able to handle the tasks typically done by signaling
protocols. It is not a multimedia transport protocol such as RTP or a
replacement for email or ftp.

The particular ones I've encountered so far in my work with IS-41 are:

1) Paging a cell phone that currently doesn't have an ongoing call
and might even be in standby mode.

2) Having an IP-based phone obtain authentication credentials from a network 
authentication server, which may also function as a SIP proxy/call agent, to
allow the IP-based cell phone to authenticate INVITEs as having
come from a valid source.

3) Allowing the call agent to request a list of features (tones
and announcements) from its home service database for delivery to the mobile 
terminal (FeatureRequest in IS-41). Athough this message would most likely be 
encountered during setup or execution of a call (when the INFO method could be
used), it may occur outside of that context and it will require communication 
between two network elements, one of which (the home service database) is not 
involved in routing the call.

There are likely to be others.

Using SIP or enhancing it if necessary is certainly an attractive option.
I'm a bit concerned that the INFO method might become a catchall, in
which people start dumping in signalling information in a uncoordinated
manner. 

Perhaps an auxillary protocol, like, SDP for the INFO method would work,
along with opening up the use of INFO between network elements when
a call is not in progress (currently it is only defined for when
a call is in progress).

It's not clear that tunnelling legacy protocols is the right solution
for all IP networks, including IP to the mobile terminal. IMHO, there is
an important compatibility role for legacy protocols, but there
are other areas, authentication for example, that could benefit
from new approaches when signalling to the mobile terminal
over IP becomes possible. All IP network elements may also benefit.

Agreed.

It depends on whether the proxy still has state for the transaction.  
If the proxy has "forgotten" about the transaction, then a 481 is
the appropriate response.

I don't think thats the right behavior. In this case, I think the proxy
should actually proxy the CANCEL, as any other request. Consider this
scenario. A UAC sends an INVITE, goes through a proxy, goes to UAS, 100
comes back. The UAC lets the phone ring for a long time. At some point,
the proxy gives up and destroys transaction state (note that it may have
been stateless to begin with). Now, the UAC finally decides to CANCEL.
So, it sends a CANCEL, and this arrives to the proxy. There is
definitely a value in proxying this CANCEL so that it can cause the
request to be cancelled at the UAS. 

Since the correct behavior of a stateless proxy is to forward all
CANCELs, it makes sense that the default behavior of a stateful proxy
which forgot its state should be the same - proxy the CANCEL.

Actually, I still think that it might be appropriate for the proxy to
return a 4xx response when it receives a CANCEL for the transaction in a
state where it shouldn't receive any save for a race condition. Not that
this makes any difference...

Also note that if the proxy has forgotten about the transaction, it
needs to forward the CANCEL after returning the 481 (and yes, I was
wrong on this in my first reply).

Thanks for responses. One more related question. Let us consider the following
scenario :

1) INVITE from UA to proxy 
2) 100 from proxy to UA and INVITE from proxy to next hop server
3) CANCEL from UA to proxy and CANCEL from proxy to next hop server
4) Proxy gets a duplicate copy of INVITE and returns 487 response
5) Proxy gets a 200 response to INVITE and forwards it upstream. This
creates a messy state at the UA. Is this acceptable ??

Thanks,
Shail

Why would it do this? The proxy should not generate the response to the
INVITE, it should wait for a response. Remember - the point of the
CANCEL is to speed up the return of a response from the UAS. The reason
you really don't want to generate one yourself like this is exactly the
case in step 5 below.

No.

Okay, so what should the proxy do with this duplicate INVITE - simply drop it
(since transaction is cancelled) or return 100 trying ??

Do the same thing you would do if a CANCEL was never received.
Retransmit the last provisional response sent for a stateful proxy, and
proxy the INVITE for a stateless proxy.

Remember - CANCELs only act to speed up a response to the transaction.
The original transaction itself, its state is not directly affected by
CANCEL in a proxy.

I guess this "No" is only valid in the context of item 4 above - the
proxy erred when sending the 487 instead of waiting for one from the UAS
and created this mess. Nevertheless, the protocol still requires UAC be
prepared to receive that 200 OK.

Paging to initiate a call? Why is this different from an INVITE?

I assume that public key mechanisms are not acceptable?

Might help to define 'call agent', as I'm not sure I have the same
understanding of this term as you might. Sounds like an OPTIONS request
to me, but then I'm not sure how 'tones and announcements' fit into
this, as that sounds like media, not signaling.

I share your concern - INFO should be used very sparingly. There is no
cost in SIP in defining new methods, for example, which allows one to
express what actually is meant rather than somehow being implied in the
body or a collection of headers.

hi,

in the sip draft, it is defined that we will be using the SIP URL for
addressing sip objects ( sec. 1.4.1 ). To me it looks like that the SIP
address is similar to the e-mail addresses . ( user@host ). So, why is
it that SIP address was taken as a different address. Why is it that the
e-mail address is not taken as a the sip address ?

My argument is this, since everyone will be having e-mail, the person
can use the same e-mail ids to make calls on SIP. There will be no need
to remeber another id just to make calls. Since we are looking at
convergence, we can have the mail servers act as the sip servers. 

Since I am new to SIP, my thought process might have flaws. Please feel
free to bring them to my notice :-)

Sure, you can certainly use your email address as your SIP address. We
chose the formatting specifically to support this. Its not mandatory, of
course, so that I can have separate providers for sip and email. So, if
dynamicsoft provides both my email and sip service, my email address is
jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com and my sip URL is sip:jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com.

Um, no. Just because these are the same address does not mean they are
the same server. Ideally, with SRV records deployed, there would be a
_sip._udp entry for the SIP server for each domain, likely a different
machine than the mail server.

>From Session Timer draft dated March 2000 (page 5):

   If no 200 OK response to a refreshing re-INVITE is 
   received before the expiration of the session, the 
   UAC SHOULD send a BYE request to terminate the call. 
   It SHOULD send this BYE slightly before   expiration 
   of the session. Ten seconds is RECOMMENDED.

I believe this paragraph is intended to deal with two different issues.
First, when the re-INVITE failed, and, second when the UAC doesn't want
to send re-INVITE to refresh the timer. 

For the first issue, ie. when the re-INVITE failed, I think the UAC
should send the BYE immediately. For the second issue, i.e if the UAC
doesn't want to refresh the timer, then it should send the BYE slightly
before the expiration of the session (10 seconds recommended).

If my interpretation above correct, then that paragraph needs to be
modified because it is confusing. And also you need to change comments
in sample call flow in page 9:

   For whatever reason, the calling UA decides not 
   to refresh. So, after 120 seconds, it sends a BYE.

The correct timeout value should be 110 seconds.

Hi,

I'm querying the idea of escaped characters in Sip Url's.
This is discussed in both the rfc and bis in Section 2.

The RFC says:

"Note that reserved characters have to be
   escaped and that the "set of characters reserved within any given URI
   component is defined by that component. In general, a character is
   reserved if the semantics of the URI changes if the character is
   replaced with its escaped US-ASCII encoding" [12]."

What I am querying is the use of this escaped notation within the hostname
of the SIP-URL.

The bnf in Section 2 Figure 3 defines the hostname to consist of only alphas,
numbers and `-' characters.  It does NOT allow for escaped characters to 
exist as no `%' char is allowed.

However, the bis draft provides an example at the end of Section 2.1 as follows:

"Thus, the following URLs are equivalent:

sip:juser@%65xample.com:5060
sip:juser@ExAmPlE.CoM;Transport=UDp"

Thus we have a contradication to the bnf with the address "%65xample.com".  
It seems to me that there would be no cause to have escaped characters in the 
host name as it could never be resolved to an actual IP address.  And to have to 
revert the escaped char back to its original form is very inefficent as extra checks
will have to be made for each character to see if it is in the escaped form.  Plus the
actual escaped char may be reverted to an invalid char for a host.

The bnf does however allow escaped characters in the userinfo and header elements, 
but not in parameter values.

To summarize, as I understand it:

Escaped characters can only be used in the following elements:

1) user
2) password
3) hname
4) hvalue

and in these cases, when doing a comparison check, the escaped values MUST be
compared in their reverted (non-escaped form).

Escaped values MUST not be used in the following elements:
1) host
2) url-parameter

Please can you confirm and clarify this matter.

thanx


gethin

Bleh,

Apologies for any confusion of message attribution, or whatever, I
seem to be missing half of this thread...

So, should a stateful proxy always return 200 for a CANCEL?  I'm
struggling to envisage a case where it would not.  It seems to me
that returning 481 implies confusing semantics, since the ultimate
UAS could "successfully" CANCEL the offending transaction.

Is this stated explicitly anywhere, or is it implied by section
12.3.4 in rfc2543bis?  Therefore, should a stateless proxy initially
return a 100 for a CANCEL, as specified by section 12.4?  (Seems
pointless if we're always going to return 200...but obviously I
may be way off with the 200.)  Actually, thinking about it, isn't
the opening text of Section 12.4 --
    "The server MUST respond to the request immediately with a
     100 (Trying) response."
-- (potentially also) wrong when considering ACKs?  (Section 10.6)

To finish, can the Ten Commandments of a Stateful Proxy Behaviour,
when dealing with Requests, be summed up as:
 0) Thou shalt always attempt[0] to proxy any Request, unless it
    is a REGISTER for the local domain (or similar);
 1) Thou shalt return 100 (Trying) whilst thou proxies, unless
    the Request is an ACK;  
 2) Thou shalt obey the mighty C code in Section 12.4 of RFC 2543
    when proxying INVITEs, OPTIONSs, BYEs;
 3) Thou shalt return 200 (OK) uponst(?) seeing a CANCEL;
 4) Thou shalt not generate any Responses to ACKs;
 5) See 0;
 6) See 1;
 7) See 2;
 8) See 3;
 9) See 4.

Of course, I made it Ten just to look clever.

Am I being too simplistic?


 - Jo.

[0] Admittedly, I'm blatantly ignoring the case of an INVITE or
    REGISTER that requires authorisaction; or any semantics implied
    by, for example, a Request with a Max-Forwards value of 0.

What about just using OPTIONS? It is a query method that gets routed in
the same way that other SIP requests, such as INVITE, would be.

If all you want to do is have two phones controlled via MGCP from the same
MGC, you don't need SIP.

I would however argue that you want to do more.

What happens if you want to talk from a device controlled by one MGC to a
device controlled by another MGC? What if those MGCs are in two different
administrative domains?

What happens if one of the end devices is NOT a stupid "slave" endpoint and
its operator doesn't want it "controlled" by a single carrier?

How do you invole value-added services provided by someone who is NOT
affiliated with your carrier in conjunction with a call that is controlled
by your carrier's MGC?

  Hi all

  I have a small doubt in the concept.
  Suppose MGCP protocol is used to transfer audio between two telephones
through a packet network using the call agents and media gateways.
  I have read that SIP is used between the call agent to call agent
communication in a wide network. I am failing to get the point behind
this.Please send me some justification of why SIP is required between the
communication.

An INVITE would work if the phone was being paged to set up a call, but paging 
does not necessarily lead to a call being set up. It may be done
for administrative reasons, for example, to flush a cached service
profile if the phone is no longer in the service area. My understanding is that 
INVITE is part of a precall setup process only.

Sure, but I'm talking about setting up the keying in the first place.
Something lightweight is needed. It may be possible to leverage
off the mobile IP keying here.

I thought that OPTIONS was only allowed in the context of either
setting up a call or an ongoing call. With regard to what the "tones
and announcents" are, that's all the IS-41 spec says about the return
value for FeatureRequest. I presume its something like the 
announcement you get when somebody's phone is off and you try to
call it. Though that is in the context of a call setup, FeatureRequest
is not restricted to an in progress call, as far as I can determine.

OPTIONS is meant to be used pre-call, to find out what the other side
can do. An INVITE may follow or not. So it doesn't have to be part of a
call.

I agree that escaping characters in host name makes little sense as that
host name wouldn't be resolvable anyway; it is explicitly disallowed by
the BNF, and the example is inconsistent with the BNF as you correctly
noted. However, I don't think the spec prohibits escaped chars in url
parameters:

other-param     = ( token | ( token "=" ( token | quoted-string )))

and BNF of token allows '%' sign (explicitly in 2543bis).

There will defintely be a need to consider interworking between SIP(-T) and
BICC, but whether this should be done by this group or ITU-T SG11, I am not
so sure about.

I do not think we need to carry BICC inside SIP-T though. BICC is basically
ISUP with extensions for controlling an IP or ATM bearer. SIP-T can already
control IP/ATM bearers using SDP so it wouldn't make sense to carry the
extra BICC stuff as well. It should instead be interworked to the equivalent
SIP mechanism for setting up the bearer.

I expect there will be discussions on this kind of issue at the next SG11
meeting on BICC (1-5 May).

I have a general question about the recommended behavior of a proxy that 
receives a non-compliant message from a UAC.

Specifically, what should a proxy do with a final response to an INVITE
that lacks a 'tag' parameter in its 'To' field.

Should it be forwarded and let the UA figure it out ?
or drop it until the callee gives up and quits re-transmitting it ?

thanks,
david

Hi James,

It sounds to me like you're looking to use SIP for something no
appropriate methods have been defined. You'll be exploiting the
addressing, routing, reliability etc., but not the well-defined
semantics of session setup. This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
  
I would echo Hennings comment about the oddness of a lot of people
seemingly being uneasy about defining new methods, when in fact this is
no more work than defining new headers, and shouldn't result in any more
interoperabiblity problems - proxies are required to treat messages with
unknown methods like other requests and presumably the destination knows
about your extension method.

There are a number of ways to signal the intent of a SIP message, e.g.
  o the method
  o the Content-Type
  o the Content-Function header, possibly with some new token

To me it sounds like in your case defining new methods is definitely
clearer and cleaner than trying to use INFO, especially when there might
not even be a body that could be used to indicate intent.

It should return 481 if it doesn't know what transaction that CANCEL is
for (i.e., it has already forgotten about that transaction or received a
stray CANCEL). I thought it might also return a 481 if it received a
CANCEL for a transaction in the state where CANCEL doesn't make sense
but the spec is quite specific on this (4.2.5 in 2543bis):

A redirect or user agent server (a proxy server as well, I guess)
receiving a CANCEL request responds with a status code 200 (OK) if the
transaction exists and a status 481 (Transaction Does Not Exist) if not.

Note that the class of CANCEL response has no impact on protocol
operation.

No special case is made for CANCEL and all other requests are to be
proxied, hence CANCEL is to be proxied as well. I don't think this
specific situation is described anywhere in the spec.

> Therefore, should a stateless proxy initially
> return a 100 for a CANCEL, as specified by section 12.4?  

No. From section 7.1 in 2543bis: "A server SHOULD send a 1xx response if
it expects to take more than 200 ms to obtain a final response." A
response to CANCEL is sent immediately, so there is no point in sending
a 1xx.

"Any" is probably too generic. You might want to send final responses
sometime as well:)

>  1) Thou shalt return 100 (Trying) whilst thou proxies, unless
>     the Request is an ACK;
See 7.1

>  3) Thou shalt return 200 (OK) uponst(?) seeing a CANCEL;
See above

>  4) Thou shalt not generate any Responses to ACKs;
Universally true.

I don't agree.  One of the interesting cases of SIP-T, for which the whole
notion
of the ISUP MIME type was invented was to allow ISUP SIP ISUP connections.
Allowing BICC SIP BICC should be allowed.  Of course, the BNC-ID, the ?ADM?
message, etc introduced in Q.BICC could just go through the MIME encap.
 
Of course, the cool thing would be to eventually get the media to flow
through all
three networks as one IP end-to-end stream!
 
I'll note that we plan to have the BNC-ID be an item specifiable in SDP for
other reasons
soon.

There will defintely be a need to consider interworking between SIP(-T) and
BICC, but whether this should be done by this group or ITU-T SG11, I am not
so sure about.

I do not think we need to carry BICC inside SIP-T though. BICC is basically
ISUP with extensions for controlling an IP or ATM bearer. SIP-T can already
control IP/ATM bearers using SDP so it wouldn't make sense to carry the
extra BICC stuff as well. It should instead be interworked to the equivalent
SIP mechanism for setting up the bearer.

I expect there will be discussions on this kind of issue at the next SG11
meeting on BICC (1-5 May).

Subject:        [SIP] Carrying Q.BICC as an Mime-type in SIP 

	ITU (SG11) is currently defining a variant of ISUP that is being
called 
"Bearer Independent Call Control" (BICC).  I'm sure many of you are aware 
of this. 

	They have completed work for Q.BICC to handle Narrowband ISDN
services over 
ATM (this is now numbered Q.1901) and they are now beginning work on IP and 
other networks. 

	It seems that networks using SIP will have to interwork with these
networks 
as well as the current PSTN that uses ISUP. 

	Could (or should) this be included in the SIP-T draft?  Would it be
its own 
type or could/should it be included as a value for the version or spec
field?

Without knowing the specifics of your application it seems OPTIONS would be 
appropriate.

One thing you haven't mentioned is alphanumeric "paging", where 
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY would be appropriate.

seems reasonable to exchange keying information either before or during a 
REGISTER.  several methods for "securing" signalling have been proposed: 
Basic, Digest, RADIUS, Kerberos, IKE, TLS.....    stay tuned, this is a 
complex topic.

tones and features seem like the type of thing returned in a 183 session 
progess message, which corresponds to an attempted INVITE, but typically 
not a call "in-progress."

if for some reason, you need to send tones to the phone completely outside 
of the context of an attempted call, i have some ideas, but i would want to 
know more specifics before elaborating.

 From the few discussions I've been involved in and the documents I've 
read, SG11 is very adamant that Bearer-Independent Call Control isn't 
supposed to carry "bearer-dependent" information.  Of course, they have 
relented a little in order to carry some addressing info 
(BIWF-address).  Also, BICC has not been extended to control IP bearers 
yet.  CS2 is still in the requirements stage and the current draft of the 
BICC CS2 requirements includes support of IP bearers as a requirement.

Given that, you may be right that it doesn't necessarily make sense to 
carry BICC in SIP-T, but it is something that should be kept in mind since 
we don't know exactly what SG11 will come up with in the end.

Perhaps what we need is a way to carry SDP in BICC. :-)

Just to be clear are you saying that you should send back 481 and proxy
the CANCEL? I thought that a stateful proxy should always forward on
the CANCEL as while it may have lost state a UAS may not have and
find the CANCEL useful.  (See Jonathon's posting earlier on this thread).

I agree that sending a 100 is not very sensible for CANCELS.
However 12.4 states a forking proxy MUST send back 100 immediately.
This contradicts what we think is the right thing to do here and the
case with ACKs where the draft also says you shouldn't generate any
responses. If we are right maybe the bis draft needs clarifying here.

Hi,

The third-party call control draft (expires September 2000) describes a 
generic way of setting up parties using a "controller".
It also mentions in section 4 that "if a participant initiates 
the call, the controller must step in as a virtual UAC/UAS and 
act as a termination and re-initiation point". I have a couple of
questions regarding this mechanism:

1) A Re-Invite initiated by the controller to one of the UAs to 
put it on hold would use the same call-leg ids of the original
Invite transaction? Note that the original Invite was not
addressed to the controller but rather to a third UA. The controller 
happened to be on the signalling path and was only monitoring the 
messages between the UAs and decided to step in.

2)Could the controller be used to "intercept" Invite requests 
to third-party users and respond to them with 200 OK in order to, say, 
connect (in the RTP sense) the UAC to a non-SIP enabled entity (e.g.
a music source). In this case would the 200 OK use the same call-leg ids
of the original Invite?

Thanks,

Eber Mello

Yes. BTW, 481 means a 481 response to CANCEL, _not_ a 481 to the
original request.

I don't really see a contradiction here. How sending a 481 is different
from sending a 200?

I agree that this needs some clarification. Probably the 200 ms rule
from 7.1 should be repeated in 12.4 as well.

Actually, just for the record, I believe CANCEL'ing outstanding branches
upon receiving a 2xx is optional for a proxy (12.4 in 2543bis), so in
this case proxying CANCEL would be appropriate.

As has been pointed out, I believe OPTIONS is appropriate. What kind of
information are you looking to obtain from the page? Is the intent that
this page have a particular state side effect? If the page has no effect
on the state of the phone, and simply returns the current location of
the phone, its capabilities, and so on, OPTIONS is exactly what you
want.

SIP is not meant as a keying exchange protocol. There are already keying
exchange protocols out there, as Rohan has pointed out. I am very queasy
about trying to invent a new one ontop of SIP just to avoid having to
implement "another" protocol. In reality, you will be implementing
another protocol, but just using SIP as a transfer method between two
points. That is the easy part of any protocol. I'll also note that
security protocols are notoriously easy to get wrong.

Without more specifics, its hard to say what the right way to do it is.

Related to this, there is a tendency of folks to try and support legacy
features within SIP by using the same legacy mechanisms used to
implement those legacy features. I don't think this is the right
approach. Rather, figure out the service requirement, generalize it, and
then consider how it can be done in SIP. Saying we need the equivalent
of "FeatureRequest" makes me nervous since the mechanism for services
within SIP is not the same as PSTN. Consider the specific case you
mention, that of getting an announcement when someones phone is off. In
SIP, it seems like this would work as follows:

1. A calls B, which is routed to B's "home" proxy
2. B is registered elsewhere, at this "remote" proxy, so B's home proxy
forwards the request there
3. at the remote proxy, the call is forwarded the current location of
the user
4. the user does not answer, so the remote proxy returns 408
5. the home proxy receives 408. It has the service enabled so that if it
receives no answer, the call is forwarded to a media server which
responds with a 183, plays the announcement, and then responds with a
final 400.

This achieves the desired service without inheriting the particulars of
how it was implemented within IS-41. 

I'll also observe that one of the absolutely essential components of the
SIP-T work, which also supports legacy signaling, is that call semantics
are always derived from SIP, not the tunneled protocols. INFO carries
messages which have no impact on call or session state, and are
basically "passed to the application", which is a gateway in this case.
This ensures that any features are still  being provided by SIP, in a
SIP fashion, while the ISUP is carrying only information that is "FYI".
This is possible since ISUP signaling is honestly not radically
different from SIP, just that it has lots of extra bits and information
that is not really needed for SIP itself.

So, for people considering INFO method for something or other, be aware
of this. The INFO draft explicitly states a very limited scope for INFO.
Using it as a catchall way for anything will definitely cause
interoperability nightmares.

There are three possibilities about what a proxy might do (as far as
responses to the CANCEL) when it receives one for which no transaction
exists:

1. not respond at all, but rather forward the response from the next hop
upstream (this is what a stateless proxy will do)
2. respond with 200 OK immediately
3. respond with 481 immediately

All three will work just fine. Igor has pointed out correctly that the
client behavior remains unchanged if it gets a 200 as opposed to 481. I
can think of unsubstantial reasons for one over the other. Note that the
spec does not say that a PROXY should return 481 if the call leg is
unknown, only UA and redirects:

I could not find anything in the spec which recommends 481 or 200 for
proxies in this case.

100 is definitely useless for CANCEL. We'll clarify that.

What do you mean by failed? Generated a non-200 class response? In this
case, definitely not, since the re-INVITE can fail for legitimate
reasons, for which you don't want to hang up the call.

If you mean fail in the sense that no response is received at all, I
guess you can send a BYE immediately if thats what you want. However,
the problem may be some kind of temporary network partition, in which
case I can envision other implementations which might prefer to retry
until the expiration of the session timer. I do believe the spec should
discuss options in the case where no response is ever received for
re-INVITE (no final response, that is).

Right, thanks.

Proxies don't really care about tags in the To fields (they do need to
be aware of them for matching rules of responses to requests, but thats
it). So, they should definitely forward the response upstream.

They would use the call-leg ids in place between the controller and the
given UA.

Yup. You can think of it as a gateway, much like SIP to H.323 or SIP to
ISUP, but here its SIP to SIP.

Of course. Here, the controller is just a UAS. It follows the rules for
UAS.

I almost agree.

Yes, the `%' is allowed in tokens, but only as a character in its own right,
not as the start of an escaped value.  The format ("%" HEX HEX) of escaped 
values are valid but escaped values themselves are not explicity 
allowed or defined in a token.

Thus, if a url parameter has the value:

%61

is this considered to be the char `a' or the three characters `%' `6' and `1'

As the bnf stands, it would be the latter.

Quite on the contrary, I think most of the time I will disconnect the
call when non-200 response is received, because it just means
something is wrong. The only exception I can think of is when the
re-INVITE failed because glare condition happens, which in this case
the client should retry the re-INVITE.

It's a good idea to discuss the options, but I think the spec should
not recommend any actions, because this will be too specific to the
applications. Some applications (like yours?) use session-expires to
keep the call alive, while some others (like mine) use it to clean-up
resources when the remote party is suspected to be dead. The
difference is that the later is more willing to send BYE than the
first.

Thanks,

If we have CS(A) --bicc ---CS(B)---sip --- CS(C)---bicc---CS(D)

where 'CS' is 'Call Server', for want of a better term, then there are two
cases:

(i) with the bearer path routed directly between Gateways controlled by
CS(A) and CS(D), and

(ii) with further 'packet-to-packet' gateways contolled by CS(B) and CS(C)
i.e. there are three 'domains' which are physically interworked at both the
call and bearer layer.

There is some doubt as to whether (i) will be possible at all - this depends
on how the support of IP in BICC is defined over the next few months. If it
is possible, I think that it should involve maping the bearer control
mechanism in BICC to the equivalent in SIP (SDP) so that the call can still
work if it terminates on a pure SIP agent. If you don't include this
compatibility, it's not SIP at all. You mention that SDP will be including
an equivalent to BNC-ID (I believe it's called EECID ?). As I understand it
this would allow you to do exactly what I'm suggesting.

If you do this mapping, then you've removed from the BICC information
everything which makes it BICC and not ISUP, so you're not carrying BICC
inside SIP at all.

In case (ii), the three domains are completely independent from each other
when it comes to setup of the bearer connection. Again, the only information
from BICC left to carry over the SIP domain is the ISUP part.

If we were to carry the BICC APM parameter, which contains the Bearer
related information, over SIP, we would be inventing a new way of carrying
out bearer setup on a SIP call - an alternative to SDP. I do not think we
should do this as it would be non-backwards-compatible.

at F5  in page 61 User B sends "486 Busy Here" response to Proxy 2, but
does not add tag value at To header field.

Then at F6 Proxy 2 sends ACK to UserB with tag value "314159"

Is this correct?

Minutes primarily taken from notes of Tom Taylor, who once again
volunteered his indispensable sevices in this heroic effort. Thanks.

These are the minutes of the SIP WG at the 47th IETF in Adelaide.  The
WG met for two sessions, Monday morning and Tuesday afternoon.

1. Agenda Bashing
=================

The proposed agenda was accepted.  Presenters from Kyoto University
asked to be added to the agenda.  The request was denied because their
draft had not been submitted in time to be published by the IETF.

2. Status
=========

Dean Willis presented a summary of status of the WG work items,
followed by a brief discussion of potential charter items. There was
discussion as to whether the DCS drafts would be considered for
adoption by the WG. The current drafts still have RFC2026 complienace
issues preventing WG adoption as work items, but these issues may soon
be resolved. The general consensus seems that several of the DCS
drafts are likely to be adopted once the IPS is resolved.


The WG indicated consensus to adopt several tasks as chartered WG
activities, including:
SIP server features (standards track)
Call flows (informational)
Session Timer (standards track)
Reliability of provisional messages (standards track)
SIP-T efforts:
ISUP MIME types (standards)
ISUP mapping (undetermined)
Single Line Extension (undetermined)
Guidelines for Extensions.


As a general note regarding the management of the work of the WG:
Jonathan Rosenberg is attempting to assemble teams around specific work
items, with the proviso that individual participants should not be
over-committed.  The "single line extension" team is an example of this.



3. Summary of Current Discussion On The List
============================================

Jonathan Rosenberg summarized the status of discussion of a number of
current issues.

3.1 draft-nair-sip-dhcp-00.txt

No issues have been raised on the list, nor comments received from the
DHCP WG.  The fast-track procedure applied to this work appears to be
acceptable to the SIP WG.

3.2 Content In INVITE

Discussion in late December of how to include of content such as JPEG
images in INVITEs brought out a number of points:
 -- whether to include the actual content, include it indirectly through
provision of a URI, or include it indirectly as a media stream
 -- location of the content, in a header or in the body
 -- the need to identify how the content is to be used.
Jonathan perceived no consensus on these items, due to lack of comment
on specific proposals made to the list.


3.3 WWW-Authenticate Syntax

There is a proposal before the list, but no comments have been received.

3.4 tel:// vs. sip:// URLs

Jonathan emphasized the importance of the issue, discussion of which has
stalled.  He would like to see a new push to resolve it.

3.5 URL Parameters For Telephone Numbers

A couple of issues have been discussed under this heading: how to
indicate that the number shown is the result of an LNP lookup, and how
to indicate private dialing plans.  Again, Jonathan would like to see
a renewed effort to resolve these issues.

3.6 To Quote Or Not To Quote: Digest-URI

Robert Sparks commented that most implementations use quotes around the
digest-URI.  Usage for other fields is variable.  He suggests that all
fields be quoted.

3.7 Re-INVITE Glare

Jonathan noted that three proposals are on the table for handling of
coincident re-INVITEs.  Scott Petrack noted the need for a solution that
works with more than two parties.  Jonathan responded that SIP states
are shared only on a per-call-leg basis, except possibly in the case of
multicast, so multileg coincidental invites may not be an issue.

[A couple of points in Jonathan's charts were skipped because they are
being considered by the SIP security task force.]

3.8 When To Send 183 Response

Jonathan presented the rules for use of the 183 response which had come
out of discussion on the list.  A brief discussion followed, in which a
problem with the first rule was noted and resolved.

3.9 Overlap Dialling

Jonathan noted that there was no easy solution to the possibility of
forking for a call in which overlap dialling is being used.  David Oran
suggested that when the gateway rejects the first call, it should return
a contact which redirects all subsequent INVITEs to the same gateway.
Jonathan noted that this changed the meaning of the Contact: header
slightly, but its usage remains within acceptable bounds.

3.10 Early Media Criticality

Jonathan noted a continuing unresolved issue of how to distinguish
between critical and non-critical early media.

In general Jonathan intends to put out notes to the list to stimulate
further discussion of the open issues.

4. Status Of I-Ds (Jonathan Rosenberg)[charts]
======================================

4.1 Caller Preferences
 (draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-01.txt)

Jonathan summarized a number of changes in the current draft.  There
have been no objections to the use of case-sensitive matching.  The
draft is due to go to the IESG, but Jonathan is looking for volunteeers
to check it out first.

4.2 Supported: Header
 (draft-ietf-sip-serverfeatures-02.txt)

The draft has undergone a major overhaul.  The one open point had to do
with use of the header with ACK.  This has been fixed and the draft has
been forwarded to the IESG.

4.3 Reliable Provisional Responses
 (draft-ietf-sip-100rel-00.txt)

A number of open issues still remain.
 -- cumulative acknowledgements: looking for an application to justify
inclusion of the mechanism
 -- response to PRACK: retain mechanism
 -- CANCEL for PRACK: disallow
We are looking to pass this document to the IESG as a Proposed Standard
by mid-April.

4.4 Guidelines For Authors Of SIP Extensions
 (draft-rosenberg-sip-guidelines-00.txt)


Jonathan proposed that this be a WG work item.  It would eventually
become a BCP, but not for another year.  For now it would be a living
document as the WG accumulates experience.  The sense of the meeting was
to adopt the work item, but there were mixed views on how quickly it
should be given formal status, with some arguing for near-term RFC
status.  This point will be taken to the list.  Jonathan has volunteered
to maintain the document if the WG chooses to make it a long-term
project as he proposes.

4.5 Third-Party Call Control
 (draft-rosenberg-sip-3pcc-00.txt)
This document has a number of dependencies, and various models of
control are possible.  In general the work does not involve an
extension to SIP, but only a description of the usage of its
mechanisms.  For this reason Jonathan does not propose that it be a WG
work item, but would like people to comment on it.

5. DCS Drafts
=============

5.1 Resource Reservation (Bill Marshall) [charts]
 (draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-00.txt)

This draft came about through the compromise merger of
draft-ietf-mmusic-qos-00.txt and draft-dcsgroup-sip-resource-01.txt.
The two-stage INVITE has been discarded.  SDP enhancements in support
of QOS and security negotiation include two new attributes (a=qos: and
a=security:), with syntax provided for confirmation that the requested
attribute values have been granted.  Extensions to SIP in support of
the negotiation of these attributes are covered in the same document
as the SDP changes, with AD approval. SIP extensions include use of a
header indicating that preconditions have been met.

The question was raised, whether there was any problem with using the
a=qos: attribute with provisional responses to allow the invitee to
set preconditions.  Bill made the point that the first user of the
attribute has to know whether the other end would understand it.

5.2 Caller Identity (Flemming Andreasen) [charts]
 (draft-dcsgroup-sip-privacy-01.txt)

Flemming summarized changes in the draft.  Earlier work has been
extended to recognize the possibility of boundaries between
proxies. In geneal, rather than requiring a nounary proxy to remove
calling party information, any proxy may encrypt the field and list
itself as an authenticator.  A new header, "Remote-Party-ID", has been
defined.  The set of possible operator services has been generalized.

Scott Petrack suggested that a specific tag for operator services might
not be in the spirit of SIP.  Jonathan agreed that an alternate approach
might be possible.  The basic idea, as always in SIP, is to define a
small set of reusable features rather than a variety of specialized
ones.

5.3 Distributing Call State (Bill Marshall) [charts]
 (draft-dcsgroup-sip-state-01.txt)

The mechanism has changed completely since the previous draft, in an
attempt to make it more general.  The draft now takes care to
distinguish between transaction state, connection state, and call
state.  The rules for including the "State" header have been
simplified.  There was a comment to the effect that the state
information must include the information necessary to ensure that it is
not used for a different call from the one which generated it.

5.4 Proxy-to-Proxy Extensions (Mike Mannette) [charts]
 (draft-dcsgroup-sip-proxy-proxy-01.txt)

Mike reviewed the changes from the previous draft.  LNP support has been
provided and hostport is now a required field in the "Gate" header.  The
"Billing-Info" and "Billing-Id" headers are unchanged.

5.5 Media Authorization (B. Beser) [charts]
 (draft-dcsgroup-sip-call-auth-01.txt)

This draft addresses the need for a per-call mechanism to authorize the
flow of media.  The new draft has been changed to focus only on the
client.  The former "DCS-Local-Gate" header has been renamed to
"Media-Auth".  The content has been generalized to hexadecimal.

6. Subscribe-Notify (Adam Roach)
==========================================
 (draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-00.txt)

Motivation: there is a need for a central definition of concepts which
have been mentioned in various documents.

The draft formalizes the methods and headers associated with
subscription and notification.  Distinctions are made between
call-related and resource-related subscriptions, with the latter
typically being of interest to third parties.  Rules are set down for
notifications and for duration of subscriptions.  The author attempted
to avoid disruption to PINT, but it might be possible to combine the
PINT work with this new material.

Scott Petrack noted that PINT had spent a great deal of time working
to make their mechanisms sufficiently generic.  He urged Adam to
review the PINT archives.  Unsubscription proved to be a tricky topic,
and PINT found it preferable to list events in bodies rather than in
headers.  Scott and Adam will discuss this further off-line.

Henry Sinnreich asked what measures had been taken to coordinate with
the Instant Messaging and Presence (IMPP) WG.  Jonathan replied that
IMPP is addressing a different problem and had already judged SIP to
be unsuitable for their purposes.  He also recalled that a general
subscription/notification BOF was held, but nothing came out of it
because the problem was too broad.

Scott Petrack noted that PINT will change if necessary to conform to
SIP.

An example subscription/notification service was presented, where the
caller is rung back when the callee becomes free.  There are open issues
where further work is required.  Jonathan proposed that another task
force be set up on the Egroup mail server, to refine the problem
statement.

Michael Thomas questioned whether SIP really needed an asynchronous
method of completing a call when the current protocol can support a
blocking approach.

7. Mobility (S. Baba) [charts]
=========================
 (draft-itsumo-sip-mobility-req-00.txt)

The draft provides requirements, open issues, and relevant work items
in SIP and other WGs.  The requirements are organized on a functional
basis.

Addressing the charts, Lawrence Conroy asked what was meant by the
requirement to "utilize" CDMA soft hand-off.  He saw this as invisible
at the IP level.  The presenter pointed out that the process might
involve multiple IP addresses for the same UA.  This would represent a
major extension to SIP.

James Polk noted that the forthcoming Location Information BOF might
be relevant to this problem.

[end of first session]

8. Review Of Charter Work Items  (Dean Willis) [charts]
===============================

Dean asked for comments on the proposed work items before the WG
chairs reviewed them and passed the results of the review on to the
list.  There were no comments.

9. INFO Method, Session Timer, 183 Session Progress (Steve Donovan)
[charts]
===================================================

9.1 INFO Method

Work on the INFO method, draft-ietf-sip-info-method-01.txt, is basically
done.

9.2 Session Timer

The Session Timer draft (draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-01.txt) underwent
significant change to reflect the new "Supported" header.  Some issues
remain before WG Last Call:
 -- refreshing of the timer.  Jonathan suggested that this be done by
re-INVITE, rather than a new method.  Agreed.
 -- Session-Expires header problematic in anything but INVITE -- will be
allowed with INVITE only.
 -- Can a proxy add Required headers? -- could end up with multiple
Required headers if the UAC also includes one.  This doesn't seem to
break anything, but there is an interaction with authorization.  In the
absence of comment from anyone but Jonathan, this should be checked out
on the list.
 -- the question was asked: what happens if the called UA includes
Session-Expires with a re-INVITE and it contradicts the one set by the
calling UA?  Steve suggested that it would be up to the implementation
to sort this out.  The list will be invited to comment.

Next steps:
 -- agreed that this becomes an official WG work item
 -- submit shortly to WG Last Call.

9.3 183 Session Progress

draft-ietf-sip-183-00.txt has a lot of dependencies, resulting in
improved understanding of the issues.  It may be used for early media
and for pre-conditions.  Summarizing the extensions involved:
 -- full session description bodies in 18x responses
 -- add the 183 response
 -- provide the "Session" header to indicate the purpose of the session
description body
The first two items are in 2543 bis already.

It is proposed that the Session header draft be refined to narrow its
focus, taking advantage of the 183 documentation.

10. Call Control (Robert Sparks) [charts]
================================

10.1 Framework For Call Control Extensions
 (draft-campbell-sip-cc-framework-00.txt)

Needs to be aligned with the guidelines.

10.2 Call Transfer
 (draft-sparks-sip-cc-transfer-00.txt)

Proposes a new TRANSFER method (not BYE ALSO), which does not alter the
original session.  Open issues:
 -- name of the method.  Jonathan interjected that he does not want to
build protocols for specific services, hence the method should have a
more abstract name and definition. Dean Willis suggested "Introduce".
 -- whether the method can carry bodies
 -- authentication.  Dean Willis suggested an "Introduced-By" header,
signed by the transferor.

10.3 Service Context -- Use of the SIP Request URI
 (draft-campbell-sip-service-control-00.txt)

This is an informational draft proposing the transmission of service
context through use of a distinctive Request-URI.  Robert provided an
example application and described the advantages of the mechanism.

David Oran was unclear on the intent of the work.  He noted that it
takes the opposite approach to that of HTML, by using the left side of
the URL rather than the right.  The syntax conflict could make the
result different depending on the server. Dean Willis pointed out that
SMTP also uses the left hand side, and that web URLs lack the @ and
therefore HAVE no left hand side.

Robert responded that the URL is intended to be an opaque entity bound
as a whole against a particular service.  David agreed that under these
conditions the format was acceptable.

The work was accepted as a Working Group Informational work item.

10.4 Call Flow Examples (Presentd by Robert Sparks)
 (draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00a.txt)

The draft has had a number of updates.  Please forward any further flows
to Alan Johnston (alan.johnston@wcom.com).

Jonathan noted that the document is getting too large to handle easily.
He proposes to farm out subsections to volunteers to review.  Ideally
they should simulate the flows to validate them.  Alan Johnston will
coordinate the work.

There is an issue with dependencies on work in progress.  The document
will be partitioned so that the stable part is processed first.

11. IETF SIP MIB (David Walker)
 (draft-ietf-sip-mib-00.txt)

Issue: the document is 70 pages long.  Can this be reduced?  It covers
RFC 2543 plus the INFO method and the 183 response.  Items are defined
within configuration, statistics, and notification groups for each of
the UAC, UAS, proxy, registrar, and redirect server, except that
elements common to all of these are grouped separately.  (Nothing has
been defined as yet to be specific to the redirect server.)

Concern: too many measurements.  Discussion of this brought out the
following:
 -- measurements should be defined only if there is a stated use for
them
 -- they are used as a troubleshooting tool, but a message history tool
would do a better job
David will send a note to the list to provoke further discussion.
Comments on how measurements are used will be welcome.  The note will
also raise a number of other questions for comment.

The current draft contains a couple of known errors.

12. BCP For SIP to ISUP Mapping (Gonzalo Camarillo) [charts]
 (draft-camarillo-sip-isup-bcp-00.txt)

This draft covers requirements, call flow examples, and the mapping of
parameters between the two protocols.  Gonzalo went over the changes to
the draft:
 -- new name
 -- additional extension: umbrella REQUIRE
 -- refinement of scope
 -- a discussion of SIP bridging between ISUP networks
 -- corrections to the handling of overlap signalling
 -- added examples.

He presented a walk-through of the overlap signalling case.  There is a
lot of messaging, but, unlike in the previous draft, it works.  There is
an open issue of how to control routing of overlap signalling in the
case of a stateless proxy forwarding to loadsharing MGCs.

A question was asked: how is connection redundancy handled -- for
example, UA multihoming.  What if the successive messages arrive at
different answers.  The reply was that this issue was out of scope of
the draft.  Jonathan remarked that SCTP transport for SIP is a topic
for the future.

Gonzalo concurrently presented a report on the status of the SIP-T
work.  It was noted that of the SIP-T work, the highest priority is to
obtain approval of the ISUP MIME types document. This is currently
planned for May 2000.

13. SIP Mapping Of MLPP (James Polk) [charts]
 (draft-polk-sip-mlpp-mapping-00.txt)

There is a mismatch between SIP "priority" levels and MLPP levels.
The draft proposals are to add a level and add administrative hooks.
Jonathan remarked that the standard is not the place to specify the
administrative hooks -- they belong in an RFP.

Subsequent discussion brought out two points:
 -- added priority level in RFC 2543bis
 -- additional document describing operation of MLPP.  This would cover
a number of items besides SIP, so it should not be a SIP WG document.

Jonathan also wondered whether MLPP really impacts SIP except at the
gateway, since it is concerned with preemption of limited call
resources in the face of higher-priority demand and IP resources are
not so obviously limited as circuits.  Brian Rosen disagreed, pointing
out that MLPP is not only about preeemption.

The outcome of the discussion was consensus to discuss adding another
priority level to 2543bis, or possibly adding "token" to the grammar
allowing arbitrary extension. This will require list review. James
Polk may submit a detailed fraft showing how the SIP priority levels
can be used to implement MLPP requirements.


14. Update On ISUP MIME Types (Lyndon Ong)
 (draft-ong-sip-qsig-mime-00.txt)

The draft has one open issue: the amount of ISUP version information
required. Followup is occuring in the SIP-T subteam and will be
reviewed on the main list when ready.

15. SIP and QOS (Henry Sinnreich) [charts]
 (draft-sinnreich-sip-qos-osp-01.txt)

Henry presented a list of "to do" items associated with the work.  He
hypothesized that a new WG may be required.  As evidence of this he
cited the need for a framework, within which different QOS models might
operate.

Radhika Roy mentioned that ITU-T Study Group 16 is also doing QOS work,
and the two groups could share their results.  Henry agreed that this
was possible.

Patrice Calhoun asked about the relationship between QOS and OSP (Open
Settlement Protocol, which appeared on Henry's charts).  Henry indicated
that OSP was relevant because it supports the clearing house model of
settlements, and the latter differs from the AAA WG model.

Melinda Shore remarked that overall (thinking also of DCS) there seemed
to be some strange QOS work going on, driven by charging models.  Hooks
within SIP are in scope for SIP WG discussion, but the general topic of
QOS for VoIP is out of scope.

Continuing in his presentation, Henry presented call flows showing the
tight coupling between signalling, QOS, and AAA.

Jonathan remarked again that ONLY changes required to SIP are within
the SIP WG's scope.

Dave Oran observed that DCS covers the "push model" of QOS: policy is
pushed to the enforcement point.  There is a need to develop a system
for the pull model, with open security issues standing in the
way. Dave proposed COPS-PR for this role.

Dean Willis suggested that perhaps the Transport Area WG could tackle the
larger problem.  Jonathan proposed discussing the matter with the ADs.

16. SIP Through Firewalls and NATs (Jonathan Rosenberg) [charts]
 (draft-rosenberg-sip-firewalls-00.txt)

Jonathan noted that the topic of firewall/NAT traversal is being covered
by the foglamps BOF.  The question is whether the SIP WG wants to do an
Informational RFC on the specific topic of SIP operation through these
barriers.

Dean Willis suggested that the question of whether this work belongs
in SIP is of the same order as whether MLPP does -- that is, both are
enablements for SIP within specific sectors.

There was a weak hum in favour of the work item.

17. Usage of TRIP For Gateway Registration (Jonathan Rosenberg)
 (draft-rs-trip-gw-00.txt)

This was simply an alert to the topic, which had been raised in the
meeting of the IPTEL WG the previous day.

18. Transferring User Control Information In SIP REGISTER Payloads
(Jonathan Rosenberg)
 (draft-lennox-sip-reg-payload-00.txt)

We need a way to pass scripts from the client to the server.  This
draft is the same as the original version a year ago, with minor
changes.  There are several open issues.  Jonathan asked "Should this
be a SIP work item?", which started a lively discussion.

Radhika Roy suggested there was a relationship to and potential impact
on mobility; Jonathan disagreed.  Lawrence Conroy wondered how the
scripts would be authenticated.  Dean Willis mentioned several
approaches that have been suggested.

Dean put the question: "even with the other alternatives, is it useful
to do this function via REGISTER?"  There was a slight hum in favour,
no opposition, with most registering no opinion.  The work was
accepted subject to approval on the list.

19. Finding A SIP Server With SLP (James Kempf)
 (draft-kempf-sip-findsrv-00.txt)

The intention is to add a template to the IANA service type registry.

Motivation: there are several ways to locate a SIP server through DNS --
for example, by use of a naming convention.  The method presented allows
location by characteristics.  This is useful because different proxies
in a domain can have different characteristics.  The approach taken is
to have one SLP abstract service type: "service-sip", with two concrete
service types.

Jim presented an example: find a registrar supporting CPL.

An open issue is how to handle incoming calls.  With other methods of
DNS usage, one can parse down the hierarchy of server names.  With SLP
it may be necessary to use SIP forking or multicast.

Should this be a WG work item or an individual draft?  IANA approval
requires RFC documentation and approval by Eric Guttman (servloc
Chair).  Comments on the draft can go to Jim directly or to the list.

Jonathan noted that this is one of many possible methods, but that's
OK.  There is certainly no point in discussing whether this work
should go forward as opposed to some other approach. The consensus was
to not adopt this as a WG task at this time, but to follow the work as
it matures and reconsider at a futue point.

20. CGI Interface (Jonathan Rosenberg)
 (draft-lennox-sip-cgi-03.txt)

The draft is being cleaned up.  A couple of issues have been resolved.
There are alternative methods for transfer of the CGI scripts. There
appears to be no intent to make this a WG item at this time.

21. Distributed Multipoint Conferences Using SIP (Jeff Mark) [charts]
 (draft-mark-sip-dmcs-00.txt)

Jeff provided some examples, showing manipulation of full mesh
conferences.  Is there SIP interest in further such full mesh work?

Jonathan noted that conference control is not part of the SIP WG mandate.
The problem of topology management is overly complicated because call
control should be separated from link state propagation.  The latter is not
something SIP is good at.

Jonathan will organize a first pass at rearchitecting the proposal,
but there are other approaches to multi-party conferencing that may prove
worth discussing.

If those of us in the telecommunications industry are going to embrace SIP
as a signaling protocol (as it appears we have), we are going to have to
find ways to do the things in the IP network that we've done in the
circuit-switched network (and wireless network).  The use of the SIP INFO
method, along with new MIME Type proposals, for ISUP and QSIG "tunneling"
appears to be generally endorsed.  It was defined as a solution to providing
much of the circuit-switched network functionality in a SIP network.  I may
be wrong, but the intention of the authors of the SIP INFO ID appears to be
for its use in solving many outstanding issues with converging the
circuit-switched network with packet networks.

Extending (where appropriate) and using existing protocols is preferable to
defining new ones in my opinion.  I do not want to see the INFO method
become a catch-all though.  Obviously, more thought and work is needed to
bring about interoperability between the two telecommunications network with
the IP network.

Bert

Not necessarily to initiate a call but to find the location (cell) of the 
station, or obtain other station information before the call is made. 

I think one of the points Jim is making is that if INVITE is used for both 
these type of queries and for initiating a call, there doesn't seem to be
a way in SIP to tell a station or any other element to treat INVITEs used
for different purposes in a different way. A possibility could be a SIP
pre-call query method.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: DHCP Option for SIP Servers
	Author(s)	: G. Nair, H. Schulzrinne
 	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-dhcp-01.txt
	Pages		: 5
	Date		: 07-Apr-00
	
This document defines a DHCP option that contains a pointers to one
or more SIP servers. This is one of the many methods that a SIP
client can use to obtain the addresses of a local oubound SIP server.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Thats not a good idea. Re-invites may fail for many reasons, including
the fact that the far side doesn't want to change the media session to
what was requested. For example, if the caller wants to add a video
stream, but the server doesn't.

It should.

No; the UAC should not insert the tag into ACK. The 486 should have a
tag, and this should be mirrored in the ACK.

Henning,

I'd like to add another example where the need of an extention to SIP might be
analyzed.

I found your "Mobility support using SIP" paper very interesting.
I think it provides a very clear picture with respect to the scope of SIP (terminal)
mobility, what should be inplemented in SIP, what in L3, what in L2 and the
advantages of SIP mobility, in those cases where it should be applied.

However there are some (very important) scenarios  that are not covered by that
paper, and I didn't manage to figure out whether all the pieces needed to implement
them are already there/something should be added to SIP/another protocol should be
used.

Let' s assume that (for a some reasons that go beyond the technical aspects) we
always have at least 3 SIP proxies betwen two mobile endpoints. (Well, they may also
be something more complicated  than a proxy, but let's call them proxys now)

   * One proxy is in the "serving" domain: the domain where I' m currently
     registered
   * One proxy is in the "home" domain: the domain where I subscribed my mobility
     service
   * One proxy is in the "requesting" domain: the domain of the calling party

Let's now say that the terminal either changes its "serving" domain or, for some
reasons, wants to change its "serving proxy", within the same domain. Everything
happens without a call being in progress (therefore we cannot use the Info method)

What happens when the request to change the "serving proxy" comes

   * (a) from the terminal
   * (b) from the current serving proxy itself
   * (c) from the home proxy

In case (a), the terminal can send a REGISTER message to the new "serving proxy",
but then how is the "home proxy" notified of the change ?

In case (b), how does the "serving proxy" notify the terminal it has to re-register
with another proxy? Is the OPTIONS method appropriate ?

Aren't we misusing it?

Again, how is the "home proxy" notified of the change ?

In case (c), how are both the serving proxy and the terminal notified ?

In general, a call-unrelated signalling exchange might be required between the home
proxy, the current serving proxy, and the new serving proxy.

Does the SUBSCRIBE & NOTIFY mechanism (draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-00.txt)
cover all these cases? In particular:

   * the handover  mechanism must work independently of the existence of a call
     involving the same two entities. Call-related subscribe requests expire at the
     end of the call. The I-D mentions the possibilty (but only for a proxy ?) to
     issue a "third-party" subscribe between the same two entities involved in a
     call. It is unclear to me whether this mechanism allows for a generic
     subscription (for example by one of the endpoints towards his proxy) performed
     during a call, that extends beyond the duration of the call itself.
   * to my understanding, the duration of the subscription should be indefinite
     (minor issue: 5 days would do, anyway)
   * Wouldn' t a generic call-unrelated notification mechanism would put a lower
     burden on the involved parties?

<p><br>Henning,
<p>I'd like to add another example where the need of an extention to SIP
might be analyzed.
<p>I found your "Mobility support using SIP" paper very interesting.
<br>I think it provides a very clear picture with respect to the scope
of SIP (terminal) mobility, what should be inplemented in SIP, what in
L3, what in L2 and the advantages of SIP mobility, in those cases where
it should be applied.
<p>However there are some (very important) scenarios&nbsp; that are not
covered by that paper, and I didn't manage to figure out whether all the
pieces needed to implement them are already there/something should be added
to SIP/another protocol should be used.
<p>Let' s assume that (for a some reasons that go beyond the technical
aspects) we always have at least 3 SIP proxies betwen two mobile endpoints.
(Well, they may also be something more complicated&nbsp; than a proxy,
but let's call them proxys now)
<ul>
<li>
One proxy is in the "serving" domain: the domain where I' m currently registered</li>

<li>
One proxy is in the "home" domain: the domain where I subscribed my mobility
service</li>

<li>
One proxy is in the "requesting" domain: the domain of the calling party</li>
</ul>
Let's now say that the terminal either changes its "serving" domain or,
for some reasons, wants to change its "serving proxy", within the same
domain. Everything happens without a call being in progress (therefore
we cannot use the Info method)
<p>What happens when the request to change the "serving proxy" comes
<ul>
<li>
(a) from the terminal</li>

<li>
(b) from the current serving proxy itself</li>

<li>
(c) from the home proxy</li>
</ul>
In case (a), the terminal can send a REGISTER message to the new "serving
proxy", but then how is the "home proxy" notified of the change ?
<p>In case (b), how does the "serving proxy" notify the terminal it has
to re-register with another proxy? Is the OPTIONS method appropriate ?
<p>Aren't we misusing it?
<p>Again, how is the "home proxy" notified of the change ?
<p>In case (c), how are both the serving proxy and the terminal notified
?
<p>In general, a call-unrelated signalling exchange might be required between
the home proxy, the current serving proxy, and the new serving proxy.
<p>Does the SUBSCRIBE &amp; NOTIFY mechanism (draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-00.txt)
cover all these cases? In particular:
<ul>
<li>
the handover&nbsp; mechanism must work independently of the existence of
a call involving the same two entities. Call-related subscribe requests
expire at the end of the call. The I-D mentions the possibilty (but only
for a proxy ?) to issue a "third-party" subscribe between the same two
entities involved in a call. It is unclear to me whether this mechanism
allows for a generic subscription (for example by one of the endpoints
towards his proxy) performed during a call, that extends beyond the duration
of the call itself.</li>

<li>

(minor issue: 5 days would do, anyway)</li>

<li>

burden on the involved parties?</li>

Thanks for the information. So can we consider Also and Requested-By header
fields MUST NOT be used for future SIP implementations ???
Do you know when the new distributed multiparty conferencing draft is
published ?

I think BNF is only supposed to define grammar (i.e., syntax), not
semantics. Thus, it's sufficient for the BNF to allow the % sign in
tokens; it's up to the application to interpret % HEX HEX as an escaped
char. I agree that the grammar would be cleaner and easier to parse if
the BNF for token listed "escaped" instead of '%' (otherwise you should
pay attention to things like %XYZ - not an escaped char).

Through registration proxying or via two separate REGISTER. The former
is probably better. In that case, the serving proxy is simply an
"outbound" proxy as far as the registration is concerned.

This would be third-party registration. Feasible, but not necessary, I
believe.

No, REGISTER is the appropriate mechanism here.

These headers may or may not end up being used in the final drafts. For
TRANSFER, I think we are calling them something else. If they end up not
being used I guess you could reuse them for something else, but that
doesn't seem wise. I'm not sure if thats what you were suggesting.

As for timelines, I think it was summer sometime.

Message waiting has come up numerous times. I agree we should have a
solution based on a subscribe/notify method. Just to note, I do believe
there are other ways to do this that can make use of other existing
protocols. For systems that use email-based voicemail storage (like
VPIM), IMAP may actually be the appropriate protocol for message
waiting. I accept that IMAP is gross overkill for systems that just want
voicemail only message waiting lamps, so something a little more focused
would be useful.

As pointed out in another thread, the described mechanism of enumerating
events in SUBSCRIBE is too restrictive and not compatible with pint.
Rather than attacking these bit at a time, I think it would be
tremendously valuable to list the general set of events and state
associated with SIP communications systems that one might wish to
subscribe to. This will help us figure out the set of things we might
like to build in to some set of "sip presence subscription documents",
which are carried in SUBSCRIBE messages to indicate what is being
subscribed to.

That is fundamentally incorrect.

The "escaped" BNF element is a lexeme in its own right.  The "token" BNF element
is a separate lexeme.  One does not exist in / is not part of the other.  During lexical
analysis, the format "% HEX HEX" will NOT be put into the "escaped" lexeme IF it
is analyzing a "token". 

i.e. The bnf DOES define the semantics.

or put another way, consider the tree representation of BNF. When parsing a token, 
the only lower nodes that exist are those of alphanum and  

"-"  "."  "!" "%" "*" "_" "+" "`" "'"

the "escaped" element does not exist below token so it knows nothing about it.  The two
are used in isolation to each other.

This is the only way the grammar can remain context-free.

If it was not context-free then it would be impossible to parse correctly as it would not be
known which context is being used.

Section 10.2.1 :

While this is true for proxies forwarding a response, it contradicts what
is stated for UA and redirect servers in 6.45.4 :

If the intention is that 10.2.1 only applies to proxies forwarding a
response, I think 10.2.1 should be updated to explicitly say that.

As far as I know, in current GSM, handover is always initiated by the
network, not by the terminal (based on radio subsystem criteria (RF level,
quality, distance) as well as network directed criteria (e.g. current
traffic loading per cell, maintainance requests etc) ).

Case a) I was suggesting was more for the sake of generality than for other
purposes (even if it has some important applications)

Even if we are here talking about a L7 handover, hand we can assume that a
lower level subsystem can handle most of the intra-proxy handovers, I
believe the same concept should apply or, at least, we should have the
possibility, for handovers, to be initiated by the nework. I don't want to
go into too much detail, also because many of such details have yet to be
agreed.

With third party registration, do you mean that the old proxy registers the
terminal on the new proxy by putting the terminal's URI in the To header and
its own (old proxy) URI in the From header ?

The home proxy can be notifed by means of a registration proxying mechanism,
fine. But how is the terminal notified about the change, anyway? There are
(technical and non-technical) reasons why it must be aware of the change.

Thanks and
Best Regards
Giuseppe

In section 16.1 of RFC2543bis there is an example of Registration. I have
a couple of questions about this scenario. I would appreciate any responses.

1) What would be the To header of the REGISTER that T. Watson sends to
the registrar at example.com. Would it be tawatson@example.com or
tawatson@bell-tel.com ?? As per the description in section 4.2.6, To header
domain could be different from the domain of the Request-URI in the REGISTER.

2) Let us say x@bell-tel.com (From: x@bell-tel.com) sends an INVITE to the
proxy at bell-tel.com and the Request-URI is INVITE watson@bell-tel.com.
As per the latest registration, the Contact is tawatson@example.com, so 
the proxy at bell-tel.com rewrites the Request-URI and sends it to the
proxy at example.com - INVITE tawatson@example.com. Now what is the search
key at the registrar - is it user@domain or simply user. If it is simply user,
then domain of To header in REGISTER is meaningless. If it is user@domain,
then To header of the REGISTER sent to the registrar at example.com must be
tawatson@example.com.

3) What if there already exists a user tawatson at the domain example.com.
Should the registrar at example.com reject the registration ?? If yes,
what response code should be used ??

Thanks,
Shail

It should also be noted that IMAP and POP are client-initiated, i.e.,
the client has to poll periodically.

We should also avoid a new syntax for each type of event, if at all
possible.

I agree this statement in 10.2.1 is very confusing, and probably
incorrect given the most obvious interpretation. It was pointed out to
me during the bakeoff by someone else also. Rules for where to send the
response should ultimately be the same for UAS or a proxy. The rules in
6.45 will result in the response being sent to the source address, and
so the same should apply to proxies. In fact, they do for a response
that a proxy forwards upstream (since the received-by address is used
first, which is the source address when not the same as sent-by). SO, if
a proxy receives a request, and just responds to it directly (rather
than proxying the request and then proxying a response), the response
goes to the source address of the request. If the request is proxied,
and then a response is received which is forwarded, it will end up being
sent to the source address the request originally came in on, since the
construction of the Via header guarantees this.

I see what you are saying. I guess you might have a point here; however,
I'm still not sure that the BNFs in the SIP specs are (or even should
be) designed in a way that allows feeding them directly into a parser
generator and not worrying about anything else. Note that there are
still quite a few places in the spec where the behavior of the grammar
needs to be explained in words. In general, BNF has its limitations and
cannot describe everything, e.g., if you go by the book, you'll notice
that many header BNFs allow multiple instances of the same parameter,
even though this is often meaningless; a special wording is needed to
describe the use of brackets in To headers, etc. The combination of the
BNF and the description gives you the complete grammar and semantics, at
least currently.

With that said, it surely is nice to make BNF as expressive as possible.
Having a separate ecsape-token to describe tokens with % HEX HEX might
make the life of parser implementors somewhat easier. Does this mean the
current BNF is broken (or doesn't allow escaped chars in url-params,
which started this thread)? I don't believe so.

Regards,
Igor Slepchin

Since participants of the 4th bake-off are probably working with their

Comments and questions are appreciated.

There's another wrinkle: While the server effectively returns the
response to the source *IP address*, it does not necessarily use the
source *port*, at least for UDP. (TCP will try to re-use the same
connection, so it will be the source port in most cases.)

Unfortunately, NAPTs rewrite both address and port and even if we wanted
to fix this, this would break the desirable feature of letting the
client specify the return port (e.g., to have everything arrive on
5060).

I fixed 10.2.1 to refer to the Via rules (I think the confusion in
10.2.1 comes partially from this address/port distinction, where port is
meant).

Maybe time to summarize and see if there's an issue left:

- The host part of the URL cannot contain %, either as itself or as an
escape mechanism:

host          = hostname | IPv4address
hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
alphanum      = alpha | digit

- For "token" elements in URLs, this is a bit tricky, since we have two
escape mechanisms that are intersecting:

  (1) the normal token definition, i.e., any letter, digit, and a large
number of symbols (-, #, $, &, %, ^, *, _, +, |, ~, ')

  (2) the rules for URLs, where some of these characters (&, +) are
reserved and thus need to be escaped if there's the possibility of
confusion with a separator. As far as I can tell, neither of them are
syntactically relevant for SIP URLs in this context (the & is only used
to separate 'header' items), so neither of them would need to be
escaped.

Thus, it might be better to define

other-param = pname [ "=" pvalue ]

pname     = 1*tokenchar
pvalue    = 1*tokenchar | quoted-string
tokenchar = alphanum | escaped | "!" | "'" | "*" | "." 
            | "^" | "_" | "~" | "|" | "%" | "-" | "#" | "/" | ":" | "@"
| "&" | "+" | "$"

(since "," is not valid in token, I didn't include it. Any that I'm
missing?)

Here, escaped can only refer to the legal characters (alphanum and the
others) to maintain "tokenness", but I can't express this in the BNF.
However, in practice this is not a problem except for spec-writers since
the pname and pvalue tokens have to be drawn from an enumeration, so
that most character combinations are invalid simply because they are not
valid parameter names.

- To make matters slightly more confusing, we do have a different
potential problem, namely the " in the quoted string. The <"> is a
"delims" character and thus must be escaped (RFC 2396, pg. 9/10). One
could argue that it only needs to be escaped if there's a possibility
for confusion, e.g., on a web page or if the URL appears in a quoted
string. However, either should be accepted by the parser.


- In URLs, %hex hex (where allowed) is always interpreted as an escape
mechanism. It is mechanically translated to the equivalent character,
while maintaining its distinct identity as a non-separator (if it could
be treated as such). Thus, 

foo%40bar@host.com

can't just be translated into foo@bar@host.com and then be parsed, since
the result would not be as expected. This is not fundamentally different
from other escape mechanisms for delimiters, like \" or "".

Thus, one should *first* split the URL into components and then
translate those parts where escaping is possible (which is pretty much
anywhere except in scheme and host).

- As was pointed out, BNF specifies syntax. It cannot express certain
things, including
  . restrictions on ordering  (an | does not imply that the elements
have to appear in order)
  . any restriction on duplication
  . the role of identifiers or restrictions on their names (e.g., "int
int" may be legal in a BNF specification but the compiler may still
complain)

  For details, see for example, pg. 172 of Aho/Sethi/Ullman:

  "Certain constraints on the input, such as the requirement that
identifiers be declared before they are used, cannot be described by a
context-free grammar."


If there are places where the grammar needs to be tightened up, let me
know.
