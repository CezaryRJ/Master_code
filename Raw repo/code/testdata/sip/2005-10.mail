Not having read any of the supporting drafts I may be wasting time with this 
Q, but:
Why is it someone you do not have a pre-established relationship with?
Is there not a chain of trust?

If A calls B and forwards to C, A need not trust that C is who he claims to 
be A need only trust B and B assert that C is really C.

this is simple, relay the ID of the connected party backward....this is
all in a semi-trusted  domain...we are not talking about the "OPEN"
internet. If the IETF can not address this need...(reality check...
vendors...services providers need this....so chill paul)

please...some sanity..

When a proxy server encounters a transport error when forwarding should it
send a 500 response upstream ?

What message should a user agent (or a proxy) send to a registrar to find
out about the eixtsing bindings ?

How, when and why should a stateful proxy transition to state less operatio=
n
and for that does it need to remain stateless for the rest of the
transaction ?

When it says that a proxy may arbitrarily group the target set and then do
parallel processing of the
addresses in a single group. Is it right to assume that such grouping can b=
e
done based on q parameter ?

How can a proxy determine the transport used to connect to the next proxy
downstream ?

In Selection of a next hop, for a particular request-URI can that be
configured manually by means other than SIP or if using SIP protocol itself=
,
how can that be done ?

How can a proxy ensure that all proxies which may be traversed by the
request (say INVITE) are loose routers ?

An element is supposed to forward the SIP message to be sent directly to th=
e
transport layer in case the transaction layer is no longer available. When
can exactly a transaction be not available ? Can it be that it has crashed
for some reason ? Will there be any manifestation of any behavioral change
for that element in which the transaction in progress is no more available =
?

What exactly is a local outbound proxy ?

Any light on these above issues would be highly appreciated.

I agree that this is needed, and I believe that what you are basically 
describing - convey the called party identity in the reverse direction, 
can be made to work and work securely against a specific (albeit 
limited) set of attacks.

What Jon's document has clearly illustrated is that, should an attacker 
maliciously forward a request (i.e., by provisioning false forwarding 
information into a proxy), there is simply no way to detect or prevent 
this attack. So, we should not even try.

The attack that I am more worried about is that user A calls user B, and 
the call is forwarded to C (as it should have been). It arrives at C's 
UA, but C, being a prankster, inserts a faked called-party-identity into 
the response, saying that they are D, and forwards it upstream. A now 
mistakenly thinks they've reached D, when they've actually reached C. 
This attack can be prevented under certain circumstances.

The easy way to provide this functionality is the following. When user C 
registers, they do so over a tls connection to their proxy. 
Authentication is done, so their proxy knows C's identity. When the 200 
OK to the invite arrives from C at C's proxy, C's proxy inserts some 
kind of identifying header containing C's identity. Of course, the proxy 
also removes any existing identity header if one was present.

This is basically the analogous mechanism to P-asserted-ID, but in the 
reverse direction.

Slightly better, I think, is the inverse of the sip-identity mechanism. 
The UAS (user C), would modify the To header field in the 200 OK 
response, to contain its actual identity. User C's proxy would add a 
signature to this, draft-ietf-sip-identity style, if it agrees that the 
called party had this identity.

The reverse sip-identity approach doesn't deal with the fundamental 
forwarding problem; the UAC won't have any way to know whether its call 
was really intended to reach joe@goodprovider.com or 
joe@badprovider.com, both of which could provide signatures over the 
response. Indeed, the endpoint itself could sign the response using any 
domain it had certs for. However, the endpoint could not claim that they 
were joe@goodprovider.com. They could not impersonate another user that 
the caller knows a SIP URI for. If C's domain supports the mechanism, it 
could strip any Identity information in the response, and thus prevent 
attacks where the endpoint acquires domains like witehouse.com and signs 
the response george.bush@witehouse.com.

The net/net is that there definitely is a clear need for this connected 
party identity from a functional perspective, and we should seek to 
provide a mechanism that we can secure to the greatest extent possible. 
That doesnt prevent all of the attacks, but nothing ever can. So, rather 
than the perfect being the enemy of the good, we should strive to do 
something here rather than nothing.

Thanks,

Sorry, Martin! This IS the IETF. We ARE talking about the open Internet 
(that's the I in IETF, right? They didn't change the acronym to 
"Interiornet" or something when I wasn't looking?).
In general, it's not in our charter to really consider something else -- 
and when we do have to write up something that works in only a small, 
walled corner of the net, it carries severe "applicability statement" 
warnings.

You want to talk a lot about approaches that only work in a walled 
garden, you need the ITU. ;-).

Depends on the forwarding mechanism that's used.

Problem case:


Alice knows Bob. Bob forwards his calls to Jack.

Alice calls Bob. Bob's proxy returns a 302, saying "Talk to Jack".

Alice sends a new invite to Jack.

Jack's proxy sends the request to Jane, because Jack told it to.

Jane answers.

Alice doesn't know Jane. She doesn't know even know Jack.

What does she do?




Now, if everybody subscribes to an identity service, and Bob identified 
Jack to Alice in terms of the identity service, and Jack identified Jane 
to Alice(which probably required that he 302 her, not proxy her, to 
Jane) then we have a network of trusted introducers, with the trust 
anchorprovided externally (in the identity service, or federation of 
identity services).

Works great. Doesn't work with proxies that actually proxy -- works only 
with redirect servers. This is the model of the SIP "identity" draft 
that works for response identity.


Another variant, and what I think you're proposing:

Alice knows Bob.  Bob forwards his calls to Jack, who forwards to Jane.

Alice calls Bob, who returns her a 302 pointing to Jack, along with a 
half-key (like X, Z, Z^XY). Bob sends the other half-key (Y, Z, Z^XY) to 
Jack via some undefined mechanism (the new, undocumented because I just 
made it up REFERPREP request, perhaps).

Alice calls Jack, and uses her half-key to validate Jack (sends him X, 
he sends back Y, both validate z^XY, proving the other party had the 
correct other half-key). Now Alice knows Bob sent the other half-key to 
Jack, and that he's therefore "trusted". Jack also knows Alice is that 
caller Bob warned him about, and that he can safely pass her on to Jane.

Jack forwards to Jane to the same way, and Alice and Jane repeat the 
key-matching process.

Works great. Doesn't work with proxies that actually proxy -- works only 
with redirect servers. Requires only a small SIP extension, and some 
careful timing management to make sure that the 3rd party has the 
introduction-key before the first party talks to them. You can do some 
slightly fancier crypto to make a session key if you want, or improve 
the crypto in other ways. And my crypto is probably wrong here anyhow, 
but we could get a real Zimmerman to fix it.



Alternative for trusting people:

If you're just willing to assume that all the proxies do the right thing 
all the time, then you can just believe whatever comes back in the 
P-Called-Party-ID (but READ the applicability statement, it's a 
P-header, and not suitable for use in the Internet).

But I bet you'll be spending a lot of time talking to high-dollar 
reverse-charge operators in the Carribbean. Heck, I might install a 
proxy on my phone just to do that for you, ok?

Now, we can work around this a little bit by eliminating 
network-serviced 302 operations, or by constraining them and forcing the 
proxy that executes the redirection to check identity for you, or by 
policing route headers at the edge so that we know that no other proxies 
got added (which breaks many service and composition models, but it's in 
IMS release 6, which IMHO, is broken in this regard). And frankly, these 
are all half-measure hacks with serious side effects.

Hi,

As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending "sendonly attribute 
(assuming sendrecv mode stream).
So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with "recvonly" 
attribute.

But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants to play 
announcement or music to user, so it can send "sendonly" attribute for 
media stream.
I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not hold).

For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how can it 
differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only in the first 
scenario when user press hold.

Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that this is hold 
scenario and not one-way audio.

Thanks,
Udit

The IESG has approved the following documents:

- 'Extending the Session Initiation Protocol Reason Header for Preemption 
   Events '
   <draft-ietf-sipping-reason-header-for-preemption-04.txt> as a Proposed Standard
- 'Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) '
   <draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-10.txt> as a Proposed Standard

These documents are products of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Allison Mankin and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-10.txt

Technical Summary
 
   The resource priority specification defines two new SIP header fields for
   call priority in the SIP user agents, namely "Resource-Priority" and 
   "Accept-Resource-Priority".  The "Resource-Priority" header field can 
   influence call handling by SIP user agents, such as telephone gateways 
   and IP telephones, and SIP proxies.  

   The specification extending the SIP reason header to add preemption
   is a companion to the above specification.  When a call is ended in
   a SIP user agent due to a resource management choice, the extensions
   in this specification allow communicating specific causes.

Working Group Summary
 
 The working group had a fair amount of difficulty getting the
 details of this to its liking, because it had to accomodate
 goals of groups with current requirements, while still leaving
 room for generality.  The solution of independent namespaces
 and reuse of the SIP authorization and authentication mechanisms
 was reviewed and much discussed till consensus was reached.
 The specification received detailed word-by-word review and
 comment until consensus was reached, and it required intensive
 efforts by the chairs and members of the working group, as well
 as the editor and the responsible AD.  
 
Protocol Quality
 
 These headers have been implemented by at least one vendor for
 several namespaces.  In some cases, implemented systems associate
 router resource management with the RP in SIP, somewhat ahead of 
 the scope of IETF design.


Note to the RFC Editor

draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority: 
 OLD:
e.g., in an ISUP IAM message originated by the gateway.

NEW:
e.g., on an ISUP (ISDN User Part) IAM (Initial Address Message) 
originated by a SIP gateway with the PSTN.


OLD:
There should not be a unique namespace for different jurisdictions.
 This will greatly increase interoperability and reduce development
 time, and probably reduce future confusion if there is ever a need
 to map one namespace to another in an interworking function.
 
 NEW:
 There should be a single namespace for all jurisdictions. This will
  greatly increase interoperability and reduce development time, and
  probably reduce future confusion if there is ever a need to map one
  namespace to another in an interworking function.

You can use c=3DIN IP4 0.0.0.0 to indicate hold in addition to =
a-sendonly.

Hi,

As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending "sendonly attribute
(assuming sendrecv mode stream).
So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with "recvonly"=20
attribute.

But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants to play
announcement or music to user, so it can send "sendonly" attribute for
media stream.
I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not hold).

For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how can it
differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only in the first
scenario when user press hold.

Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that this is hold
scenario and not one-way audio.

Thanks,
Udit

Since the phones don't support dual registration Cisco won't help.  =
Anyone got any ideas?  Do I have something configured incorrectly on my =

hi all,
 for registration using akav1algorithm,
the nonce value of the WWW-Authenticate header of 401 response for REGISTER
contains the base 64 encoded RAND, AUTN and Server Specific Data.
 how do we parse the RAND, AUTN and Server Specific Data from the nonce
value?
 according to rfc 3310 example in section 3.2 :

___________________________________________________________________________=

 here a 32 bit value is given for RAND and AUTN.
each base 64 digit will be 6 bit long.
so how do we fit it into 32 bits?
 i'm a little confused on this one?
kindly help me out.

I want to know is it the genral behaviour of all UAC?

because as per RFC, c=0 has not been recommended for RTCP purposes,
anyway in these cases, we might need RTCP reports also,

Why cant we have one more attribute "a=hold" which indicates its meant for 
hold and not for one-way media audio stream,

Thanks,
Udit

Udit

You can use c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0 to indicate hold in addition to a-sendonly.

Hi,

As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending "sendonly attribute
(assuming sendrecv mode stream).
So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with "recvonly"
attribute.

But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants to play
announcement or music to user, so it can send "sendonly" attribute for
media stream.
I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not hold).

For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how can it
differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only in the first
scenario when user press hold.

Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that this is hold
scenario and not one-way audio.

Thanks,
Udit

The use of c=0 is an old (now deprecated) action in response to a 
request to initiate hold. The mechanism still exists, and is still 
important for some call flows unrelated to hold. There is of course 
nothing to prevent a UA from using it when initiating Hold, and the peer 
should do something reasonable in response.

I think mostly because hold is a feature, and IETF doesn't standardize 
features. The existing directionality attributes are mechanisms that may 
be used for hold or other things.

If you introduced a hold attribute, then there would be a lot of call to 
have different flavors of hold - one way, two way, with music, without 
music, etc. And of course you would need to get into the precise 
semantics of hold.

As things stand, Hold is a local feature on an endpoint. The 
corresponding signaling should not really be considered as signaling 
"hold" - it is only signaling the desired media behavior. I think there 
is no expectation, or need, for the other UA, or servers in the path to 
be able to determine that the call is "held".

Some related discussion has also gone on in SIP Forum context recently. 

I believe an additional issue here is that, in many practical deployments, 
there is something in between the UAs (softswitch, ip-pbx, SBC, other B2B 
UA) which could mis-interpret the meaning of the SDPs and take the wrong 
action based on assumptions.  For example the middle entity could see the 
sendonly attribute, assume it is for Hold when it actually being used to 
implement (say) a one-way audio conference/listen session, and go ahead 
and insert it's own music on hold.  Oops!   There are many, many such 
scenarios.  This can certainly happen, no matter how well-behaved the UA 
is (... and not all UAs are well behaved of course ;-). 

I'm NOT saying such middle boxes are good, bad or indifferent.  (I'm sure 
others will chime in that they are inherently evil ;-)  However, they are 
a practical reality. 

Having some form of explicit "reason" indicator, likely at SIP level not 
in SDP, could be a big help to solve this issue, and similar ones.  Would 
potentially help clean up both middle box and UA behavior. 

Thinking out loud ...

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending &quot;sendonly attribute<br>
&gt; (assuming sendrecv mode stream).<br>
&gt; So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with &quot;recvonly&quot;<br>
&gt; attribute.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants to play<br>
&gt; announcement or music to user, so it can send &quot;sendonly&quot; attribute for<br>
&gt; media stream.<br>
&gt; I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not hold).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how can it<br>
&gt; differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only in the first<br>
&gt; scenario when user press hold.</font>
<br><font size=2 face="Courier New">&gt; <br>
&gt; Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that this is hold<br>
&gt; scenario and not one-way audio.<br>

Peter,

I think this is a matter of philosophy. IMO the development of sip has 
been predicated on the assumtion that the UA is the one that knows what 
is going on, and that at least coordinates actions, if it doesn't do 
them itself. The other elements of the network have much less 
information about what is going on, and hence have a much harder time of 
deciding on their own how to "help" without "hurting" instead.

Certainly the sip signaling gives intermediates *some* information about 
what is going on, enough to do the limited sets of things that have been 
proposed that they do. But they certainly don't have the big picture.

In the case of hold, there is no problem as long as the endpoints do 
what they should and the intermediates just stay out of the way. The 
problem comes in when intermediates want to "help" without having 
adequate information to do so correctly. There are two solutions to this 
problem: they could stop trying to help, or they can be provided with 
more information so they can do a better job of helping.

Before proposing that more information be provided, I think it is first 
necessary to decide if this is the appropriate direction to be going.

Hi Paul, 
Agree on all points   Just pointing out an additional practical issue in

&gt; are many, many such scenarios. &nbsp;This can certainly happen, no matter how <br>
&gt; well-behaved the UA is (... and not all UAs are well behaved of course <br>
&gt; ;-). &nbsp;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I'm NOT saying such middle boxes are good, bad or indifferent. &nbsp;(I'm <br>
&gt; sure others will chime in that they are inherently evil ;-) &nbsp;However, <br>
&gt; they are a practical reality. &nbsp;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Having some form of explicit &quot;reason&quot; indicator, likely at SIP level not <br>
&gt; in SDP, could be a big help to solve this issue, and similar ones. <br>
&gt; &nbsp;Would potentially help clean up both middle box and UA behavior. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Peter,<br>
<br>
I think this is a matter of philosophy. IMO the development of sip has <br>
been predicated on the assumtion that the UA is the one that knows what <br>
is going on, and that at least coordinates actions, if it doesn't do <br>
them itself. The other elements of the network have much less <br>
information about what is going on, and hence have a much harder time of <br>
deciding on their own how to &quot;help&quot; without &quot;hurting&quot; instead.<br>
<br>
Certainly the sip signaling gives intermediates *some* information about <br>
what is going on, enough to do the limited sets of things that have been <br>
proposed that they do. But they certainly don't have the big picture.<br>
<br>
In the case of hold, there is no problem as long as the endpoints do <br>
what they should and the intermediates just stay out of the way. The <br>
problem comes in when intermediates want to &quot;help&quot; without having <br>
adequate information to do so correctly. There are two solutions to this <br>
problem: they could stop trying to help, or they can be provided with <br>
more information so they can do a better job of helping.<br>
<br>
Before proposing that more information be provided, I think it is first <br>
necessary to decide if this is the appropriate direction to be going.<br>

&gt; &nbsp;&gt; Why cant we have one more attribute &quot;a=hold&quot; which indicates its <br>
&gt; meant for<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; hold and not for one-way media audio stream,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I think mostly because hold is a feature, and IETF doesn't standardize<br>
&gt; features. The existing directionality attributes are mechanisms that may<br>
&gt; be used for hold or other things.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you introduced a hold attribute, then there would be a lot of call to<br>
&gt; have different flavors of hold - one way, two way, with music, without<br>
&gt; music, etc. And of course you would need to get into the precise<br>
&gt; semantics of hold.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As things stand, Hold is a local feature on an endpoint. The<br>
&gt; corresponding signaling should not really be considered as signaling<br>
&gt; &quot;hold&quot; - it is only signaling the desired media behavior. I think there<br>
&gt; is no expectation, or need, for the other UA, or servers in the path to<br>
&gt; be able to determine that the call is &quot;held&quot;.<br>

&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending &quot;sendonly attribute<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; (assuming sendrecv mode stream).<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with &quot;recvonly&quot;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; attribute.<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants to play<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; announcement or music to user, so it can send &quot;sendonly&quot; attribute for<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; media stream.<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not hold).<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how can it<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only in the first<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; scenario when user press hold.<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that this is hold<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; scenario and not one-way audio.<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; Thanks,<br>

At one point we are saying that hold is a feature,
and in RFC 3264, we are saying if you want to put streams on hold, then 
use "sendonly" attribute,

So basically we are giving guidelines for UAC to indicate when it wants to 
put streams on hold, but not differnetiating when it wants to open one-way 
media stream.

Actually, from UAC to UAS perspective, it is not much of an issue, but for 
B2B applications, it is certainly an issue.

Regarding the different flavous of hold, why do we need to define all 
flavours, let it be the service responsibilty.

I have seen similar thread going on SIPForum-techwg for UA behaviour 
regarding MOH..

"sendonly" attribute indicates that it wants to play some music or 
announcements...
What if UAC does not want to play music and want to hold stream, and 
services wants to play MOH to other party.

Its better if we can just convey the information in SDP, that this is for 
hold.

Regads,
Udit

RE: [Sip] Re: [Sip-implementors] Hold SDP







You guys have piqued my curiosity here.  I agree with just about
everything
you said, Paul, except that I'm not quite sure its so simple to say that
hold is a "feature" and not an "attribute".  The semantics are fuzzy.

To the caller, the action of pressing some "hold" button is an
expectation
for a particular sort of behavior, music or not. From the perspective of
the
service receiving the request, the request for the behavior from the
caller
can be interpreted in a few ways, and thus becomes a "feature".  But in
any
event there seems to be no way to differentiate the users "intent"
simply
by examining the send/receive attributes of the SDP.  Is this not at the
heart of the complaint?


If so, I think Udit, and many others who have whined about the
inadequacy of
the send/receive semantics, have a point... why can there not be
something to signal this intent?  Perhaps we can hash out the
distinctions.


Gordon.

&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; because as per RFC, c=0 has not been recommended for RTCP purposes,<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; The use of c=0 is an old (now deprecated) action in response to a<br>

&gt; important for some call flows unrelated to hold. There is of course<br>

&gt; should do something reasonable in response.<br>
&gt;<br>

indicates its<br>
meant<br>
&gt; for<br>
&gt; &gt; hold and not for one-way media audio stream,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think mostly because hold is a feature, and IETF doesn't standardize<br>
&gt; features. The existing directionality attributes are mechanisms that<br>
may<br>
&gt; be used for hold or other things.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you introduced a hold attribute, then there would be a lot of call<br>
to<br>
&gt; have different flavors of hold - one way, two way, with music, without<br>
&gt; music, etc. And of course you would need to get into the precise<br>
&gt; semantics of hold.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As things stand, Hold is a local feature on an endpoint. The<br>
&gt; corresponding signaling should not really be considered as signaling<br>
&gt; &quot;hold&quot; - it is only signaling the desired media behavior.
I think<br>
there<br>
&gt; is no expectation, or need, for the other UA, or servers in the path<br>
to<br>
&gt; be able to determine that the call is &quot;held&quot;.<br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending &quot;sendonly<br>
attribute<br>
&gt; &gt; (assuming sendrecv mode stream).<br>
&gt; &gt; So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with &quot;recvonly&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; attribute.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants to play<br>
&gt; &gt; announcement or music to user, so it can send &quot;sendonly&quot;
attribute<br>
for<br>
&gt; &gt; media stream.<br>
&gt; &gt; I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not hold).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how can
it<br>
&gt; &gt; differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only in
the<br>
first<br>
&gt; &gt; scenario when user press hold.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that this
is<br>
hold<br>
&gt; &gt; scenario and not one-way audio.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br>

With Paul's response to Peter Blatherwick, I think I now understand
Paul's perspective.

=20

Historically, a Hold operation involved a scene using three pieces of
equipment; caller A's phone,

some intermediate equipment (a PBX) and caller B's phone. The semantics
of the operation here are

that Caller B forces the PBX equipment to behave a certain way such that
caller A now here's something

else, while caller B does some other thing.  Simple enough and apologies
for the obvious.

=20

Maybe the issue here, to Paul's point, is that emulating this behavior
using the SIP model, is the

wrong thing to attempt.  In current implementations of this three-piece
equipment emulation of Hold,

the equipment (B2BUA? App Server?) in the middle tries to interpret some
REINVITE from Caller B

to mean that it needs to alter Caller A's media, and starts spewing MOH
to it.

=20

Inventing a mechanism for Caller B to tell the intermediate equipment
specifically to "go into this Hold mode"

is probably evil, since the behavior would be undefined if there were
lots of intervening equipment between

Caller A and Caller B. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have
done by building stuff that interprets the

SDP exchange as meaning "go into Hold".

=20

But maybe inventing a mechanism to allow Caller B to tell Caller A
DIRECTLY to "go do whatever you do

when you are waiting" is NOT inappropriate. Caller A is now free to play
its own music to itself, or to=20

flip over to a music service or whatever. Perhaps this still crosses
Paul's line of "IETF does not standardize features".

I dunno.

=20

This also, I realize, does not address the situation where Caller B's
equipment wishes to control the content. :-)

But in that event, why do you need to alter Caller A's media at all?

At one point we are saying that hold is a feature,=20
and in RFC 3264, we are saying if you want to put streams on hold, then
use "sendonly" attribute,=20

So basically we are giving guidelines for UAC to indicate when it wants
to put streams on hold, but not differnetiating when it wants to open
one-way media stream.=20

Actually, from UAC to UAS perspective, it is not much of an issue, but
for B2B applications, it is certainly an issue.=20

Regarding the different flavous of hold, why do we need to define all
flavours, let it be the service responsibilty.=20

I have seen similar thread going on SIPForum-techwg for UA behaviour
regarding MOH..=20

"sendonly" attribute indicates that it wants to play some music or
announcements...=20
What if UAC does not want to play music and want to hold stream, and
services wants to play MOH to other party.=20

Its better if we can just convey the information in SDP, that this is
for hold.=20

You guys have piqued my curiosity here.  I agree with just about
everything
you said, Paul, except that I'm not quite sure its so simple to say that
hold is a "feature" and not an "attribute".  The semantics are fuzzy.

To the caller, the action of pressing some "hold" button is an
expectation
for a particular sort of behavior, music or not. From the perspective of
the
service receiving the request, the request for the behavior from the
caller
can be interpreted in a few ways, and thus becomes a "feature".  But in
any
event there seems to be no way to differentiate the users "intent"
simply
by examining the send/receive attributes of the SDP.  Is this not at the
heart of the complaint?


If so, I think Udit, and many others who have whined about the
inadequacy of
the send/receive semantics, have a point... why can there not be
something to signal this intent?  Perhaps we can hash out the
distinctions.

<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; nothing to prevent a UA from using =
it when
initiating Hold, and the</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">peer</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; should do something reasonable in =
response.</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; Why cant we have one more =
attribute
&quot;a=3Dhold&quot; which indicates its</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">meant</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; for</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; hold and not for one-way media =
audio
stream,</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; I think mostly because hold is a =
feature, and
IETF doesn't standardize</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; features. The existing =
directionality
attributes are mechanisms that</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">may</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; be used for hold or other =
things.</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; If you introduced a hold attribute, =
then
there would be a lot of call</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">to</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; have different flavors of hold - one =
way, two
way, with music, without</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; music, etc. And of course you would =
need to
get into the precise</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; semantics of hold.</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; As things stand, Hold is a local =
feature on
an endpoint. The</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; corresponding signaling should not =
really be
considered as signaling</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &quot;hold&quot; - it is only =
signaling the
desired media behavior. I think</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">there</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; is no expectation, or need, for the =
other UA,
or servers in the path</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">to</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; be able to determine that the call =
is

<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; Hi,</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; As per RFC 3264, user agent =
indicate
hold by sending &quot;sendonly</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">attribute</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; (assuming sendrecv mode =
stream).</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; So when UAS receives this SDP, =
it should
respond with &quot;recvonly&quot;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; attribute.</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; But same mechanism can be used =
by user
agent if he wants to play</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; announcement or music to user, =
so it can
send &quot;sendonly&quot; attribute</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">for</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; media stream.</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; I mean if it simply wants =
one-way
connection (this is not hold).</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants =
to
provide MOH service, how can it</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; differentiate between two SDP =

hold.</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt;</font></tt><br>
<tt><font face=3D"Courier New">&gt; &gt; Is there any other way where =
user agent

Probably not a topic for the SIP list, but I'll be happy to talk to  
you about it off-list.

A new Request for Comments is now available in online RFC libraries.


        RFC 4168

        Title:      The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
                    as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol
                    (SIP)

        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-sctp-06.txt

        URL:        ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4168.txt


This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol) as the transport mechanism between SIP
(Session Initiation Protocol) entities.  SCTP is a new protocol that
provides several features that may prove beneficial for transport
between SIP entities that exchange a large amount of messages,
including gateways and proxies.  As SIP is transport-independent,
support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly
identical to support for TCP. 

This document is a product of the Session Initation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG with the message body 
help: ways_to_get_rfcs.  For example:

        To: rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
        Subject: getting rfcs

        help: ways_to_get_rfcs

Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the
author of the RFC in question, or to RFC-Manager@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Unless
specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for
unlimited distribution.

Submissions for Requests for Comments should be sent to
RFC-EDITOR@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Please consult RFC 2223, Instructions to RFC
Authors, for further information.

The problem seems to be that some people want something that means:

"I want to keep this call around, and I don't want to deal with the=20
media, but I am hoping some other network element will take care of that=20
for me, without me doing anything more than saying this."

I don't buy it, but that seems to be what people are asking for.

As far as I am concerned, HOLD is a concept that is known to the UA that=20
initiates it, and nobody else. Others may know that a media stream is=20
sendonly or inactive, but they can't really tell if that is because they=20
have been put on hold or merely that the other party doesn't want to=20
receive their audio. (E.g. I might reinvite with recvonly because my=20
MUTE button was pressed. That doesn't mean the other end put me on hold.)

Trying to *define* hold will be a slippery slope. I don't see much=20
upside to trying.

So after re-reading the original post I am left with the same question I 
have always had WRT to hold and SDPs.  RFC 3264 is a very nice document but 
why not just tell the truth.

If I have gone on hold and my flavour of hold is neither sending nor 
receiving why would I mark my SDP as sendonly?  I am not sendonly.  I should 
HONESTLY state I am inactive no matter what my stream was before.

If on the other hand my flavour of hold involves playing music to the other 
endpoint then I should HONESTLY state I am sendonly [or heck maybe my music 
oh hold server is a DTMF driven juke box, what fun... ie sendrecv]

If a B2B in the middle sees that you are NOT sending then if it wishes to 
get in the way... let it... after all, some might say it is not in the 
middle... there are two calls.  [A called the B2B and the B2B called B].

As for c=0... well that is very similar to being either inactive or sendonly 
in so much as you refuse to recv, but it does nothing to indicate if you are 
sending.  An agent in the middle cannot start MoH just because c=0, it is 
too weak.  An agent in the middle must have positive indication that you are 
NOT sending.  c=0 just dosn't cut it.

So there is no need for MORE info for an agent in the middle positively know 
that you are not sending.  You just need all UAs to tell the truth [in spite 
of RFC 3264's recommendation that you fib a little and claim you are sending 
even if you are not].

Thanks.  That was what I was trying to remember.  Agree with your
analysis.  Even in the PSTN worlds there are differing views about what
going on hold means.  But, back to the need.  Given that the four
possible cases (inactive, sendonly, recvonly, sendrecv) are possible, is
the issue really about what the far end is expected to do when offered
each of these, or is it that the wrong indication is being sent?

Mike

RE: [Sip] Re: [Sip-implementors] Hold SDP






So after re-reading the original post I am left with the same question I
have always had WRT to hold and SDPs.  RFC 3264 is a very nice document 
but
why not just tell the truth.

If I have gone on hold and my flavour of hold is neither sending nor
receiving why would I mark my SDP as sendonly?  I am not sendonly.  I 
should
HONESTLY state I am inactive no matter what my stream was before.

>>[Udit] a="inactive" has one more different meaning as per RFC 3264 where 
you can use it to do capabilities negotiation without actually opening 
>>media [Udit] streams..same problem will arise as we will have two 
differnet interpretation of this mode.. RFC 3264 specifically say if media 
streams >>have to be put on hold, it should use "sendonly attribute, 
rather it should be if you want to play media/music then it must be 
sendonly,..

If on the other hand my flavour of hold involves playing music to the 
other
endpoint then I should HONESTLY state I am sendonly [or heck maybe my 
music
oh hold server is a DTMF driven juke box, what fun... ie sendrecv]

>>[Udit] This seems ok, and thats what the main concern is, if he doesnt 
want to d oanything and any third >>party wants to do something, how can 
it indicate this?

If a B2B in the middle sees that you are NOT sending then if it wishes to
get in the way... let it... after all, some might say it is not in the
middle... there are two calls.  [A called the B2B and the B2B called B].

As for c=0... well that is very similar to being either inactive or 
sendonly
in so much as you refuse to recv, but it does nothing to indicate if you 
are
sending.  An agent in the middle cannot start MoH just because c=0, it is
too weak.  An agent in the middle must have positive indication that you 
are
NOT sending.  c=0 just dosn't cut it.

So there is no need for MORE info for an agent in the middle positively 
know
that you are not sending.  You just need all UAs to tell the truth [in 
spite
of RFC 3264's recommendation that you fib a little and claim you are 
sending
even if you are not].

have always had WRT to hold and SDPs. &nbsp;RFC 3264 is a very nice document

why not just tell the truth.<br>
</tt></font>
<br><font size=2><tt>If I have gone on hold and my flavour of hold is neither

<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&gt;&gt;[Udit] a=&quot;inactive&quot;
has one more different meaning as per RFC 3264 where you can use it to
do capabilities negotiation without actually opening &gt;&gt;media [Udit]
streams..same problem will arise as we will have two differnet interpretation
of this mode.. RFC 3264 specifically say if media streams &gt;&gt;have
to be put on hold, it should use &quot;sendonly attribute, rather it should
be if you want to play media/music then it must be sendonly,..</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2><tt>If on the other hand my flavour of hold involves playing
music to the other<br>

</tt></font>
<br><font size=2><tt>&gt;&gt;[Udit] This seems ok, and thats what the main
concern is, if he doesnt want to d oanything and any third &gt;&gt;party
wants to do something, how can it indicate this?</tt></font>
<br>
<br><font size=2><tt>If a B2B in the middle sees that you are NOT sending

B].<br>
</tt></font>
<br><font size=2><tt>As for c=0... well that is very similar to being either
inactive or sendonly<br>
in so much as you refuse to recv, but it does nothing to indicate if you
are<br>
sending. &nbsp;An agent in the middle cannot start MoH just because c=0,
it is<br>
too weak. &nbsp;An agent in the middle must have positive indication that
you are<br>
NOT sending. &nbsp;c=0 just dosn't cut it.<br>
</tt></font>
<br><font size=2><tt>So there is no need for MORE info for an agent in

that you are not sending. &nbsp;You just need all UAs to tell the truth

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;With Paul's response to Peter Blatherwick, I think I now understand<br>
&gt;Paul's perspective.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Historically, a Hold operation involved a scene using three pieces
of<br>
&gt;equipment; caller A's phone,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;some intermediate equipment (a PBX) and caller B's phone. The semantics<br>
&gt;of the operation here are<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;that Caller B forces the PBX equipment to behave a certain way such
that<br>
&gt;caller A now here's something<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;else, while caller B does some other thing. &nbsp;Simple enough and
apologies<br>
&gt;for the obvious.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Maybe the issue here, to Paul's point, is that emulating this behavior<br>
&gt;using the SIP model, is the<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;wrong thing to attempt. &nbsp;In current implementations of this three-piece<br>
&gt;equipment emulation of Hold,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;the equipment (B2BUA? App Server?) in the middle tries to interpret
some<br>
&gt;REINVITE from Caller B<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;to mean that it needs to alter Caller A's media, and starts spewing
MOH<br>
&gt;to it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Inventing a mechanism for Caller B to tell the intermediate equipment<br>
&gt;specifically to &quot;go into this Hold mode&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;is probably evil, since the behavior would be undefined if there were<br>
&gt;lots of intervening equipment between<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Caller A and Caller B. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have<br>
&gt;done by building stuff that interprets the<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;SDP exchange as meaning &quot;go into Hold&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;But maybe inventing a mechanism to allow Caller B to tell Caller A<br>
&gt;DIRECTLY to &quot;go do whatever you do<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;when you are waiting&quot; is NOT inappropriate. Caller A is now free
to play<br>
&gt;its own music to itself, or to<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;flip over to a music service or whatever. Perhaps this still crosses<br>
&gt;Paul's line of &quot;IETF does not standardize features&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I dunno.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;This also, I realize, does not address the situation where Caller B's<br>
&gt;equipment wishes to control the content. :-)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;But in that event, why do you need to alter Caller A's media at all?<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;At one point we are saying that hold is a feature,<br>
&gt;and in RFC 3264, we are saying if you want to put streams on hold,
then<br>
&gt;use &quot;sendonly&quot; attribute,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;So basically we are giving guidelines for UAC to indicate when it wants<br>
&gt;to put streams on hold, but not differnetiating when it wants to open<br>
&gt;one-way media stream.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Actually, from UAC to UAS perspective, it is not much of an issue,
but<br>
&gt;for B2B applications, it is certainly an issue.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Regarding the different flavous of hold, why do we need to define all<br>
&gt;flavours, let it be the service responsibilty.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I have seen similar thread going on SIPForum-techwg for UA behaviour<br>
&gt;regarding MOH..<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&quot;sendonly&quot; attribute indicates that it wants to play some
music or<br>
&gt;announcements...<br>
&gt;What if UAC does not want to play music and want to hold stream, and<br>
&gt;services wants to play MOH to other party.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Its better if we can just convey the information in SDP, that this
is<br>
&gt;for hold.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;You guys have piqued my curiosity here. &nbsp;I agree with just about<br>
&gt;everything<br>
&gt;you said, Paul, except that I'm not quite sure its so simple to say
that<br>
&gt;hold is a &quot;feature&quot; and not an &quot;attribute&quot;. &nbsp;The
semantics are fuzzy.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;To the caller, the action of pressing some &quot;hold&quot; button
is an<br>
&gt;expectation<br>
&gt;for a particular sort of behavior, music or not. From the perspective
of<br>
&gt;the<br>
&gt;service receiving the request, the request for the behavior from the<br>
&gt;caller<br>
&gt;can be interpreted in a few ways, and thus becomes a &quot;feature&quot;.
&nbsp;But in<br>
&gt;any<br>
&gt;event there seems to be no way to differentiate the users &quot;intent&quot;<br>
&gt;simply<br>
&gt;by examining the send/receive attributes of the SDP. &nbsp;Is this
not at the<br>
&gt;heart of the complaint?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;If so, I think Udit, and many others who have whined about the<br>
&gt;inadequacy of<br>
&gt;the send/receive semantics, have a point... why can there not be<br>
&gt;something to signal this intent? &nbsp;Perhaps we can hash out the<br>
&gt;distinctions.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to know is it the genral behaviour of all UAC?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of UAs out there. Its hard to say what the &quot;general&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; behavior is.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because as per RFC, c=0 has not been recommended for RTCP
purposes,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway in these cases, we might need RTCP reports also,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The use of c=0 is an old (now deprecated) action in response
to a<br>
&gt; &gt; request to initiate hold. The mechanism still exists, and is
still<br>
&gt; &gt; important for some call flows unrelated to hold. There is of
course<br>
&gt; &gt; nothing to prevent a UA from using it when initiating Hold, and
the<br>
&gt;peer<br>
&gt; &gt; should do something reasonable in response.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why cant we have one more attribute &quot;a=hold&quot; which
indicates its<br>
&gt;meant<br>
&gt; &gt; for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hold and not for one-way media audio stream,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I think mostly because hold is a feature, and IETF doesn't standardize<br>
&gt; &gt; features. The existing directionality attributes are mechanisms
that<br>
&gt;may<br>
&gt; &gt; be used for hold or other things.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If you introduced a hold attribute, then there would be a lot
of call<br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt; &gt; have different flavors of hold - one way, two way, with music,
without<br>
&gt; &gt; music, etc. And of course you would need to get into the precise<br>
&gt; &gt; semantics of hold.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As things stand, Hold is a local feature on an endpoint. The<br>
&gt; &gt; corresponding signaling should not really be considered as signaling<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;hold&quot; - it is only signaling the desired media behavior.
I think<br>
&gt;there<br>
&gt; &gt; is no expectation, or need, for the other UA, or servers in the
path<br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt; &gt; be able to determine that the call is &quot;held&quot;.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As per RFC 3264, user agent indicate hold by sending &quot;sendonly<br>
&gt;attribute<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (assuming sendrecv mode stream).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So when UAS receives this SDP, it should respond with &quot;recvonly&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attribute.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But same mechanism can be used by user agent if he wants
to play<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; announcement or music to user, so it can send &quot;sendonly&quot;
attribute<br>
&gt;for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; media stream.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean if it simply wants one-way connection (this is not
hold).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; For 3PCC (as B2B), if it wants to provide MOH service, how
can it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; differentiate between two SDP because it will play MOH only
in the<br>
&gt;first<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; scenario when user press hold.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any other way where user agent can indicate that
this is<br>
&gt;hold<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; scenario and not one-way audio.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br>

Hi,

As per RFC 3264, mode "inactive" ca nbe used for codec negoitation,

Consider the scenario where there is a call established between A and B 
using codec 1,

If A sends Re-invite with media line having direction as "inactive" and 
codec as 0 and 2

What should be the behaviour of B?

If it sends answer with codec 0 and 2 and mode as "inactive" (assume it 
supports codec 0 and 2),
will it indicate that it had only answer the negoitated codec 
and A and B are still talking using codec 0? 

OR

there is no media between A and B now, if A wants, it can make it active 
by another offer with the answer codec and "sendrecv" direction?

Regards,
Udit

RFC 3264 does indeed tell you to do that. In section 5.1 it states:
"If the offerer wishes to communicate, but wishes to neither send nor
receive media at this time, it MUST mark the stream with an "a=inactive"
attribute."

The problem is, this appears to be contradicted elsewhere.

John

Hi Udit,
=20
I feel your offer-answer is valid with respect to the "m=3D"
and "c=3D" lines (make sure that you include all mandatory lines).
=20
If the audio media has a different connection address
then it is completely valid to put the extra "c=3D" under
the "m=3Daudio" line.
=20
It is also valid because for every "m=3D" line in the offer, there
is a matching "m=3D" line in the offer.
=20
Regards,

Attila

This is clearly wrong. The offer/answer has succeeded, and the direction 
is "inactive", so this has superceded the previous agreement.

This must be the interpretation.

IMO it is pretty clear what the far end is supposed to do:

- if offered inactive, it MUST answer inactive. It should not
   expect to receive anything. What to do if it happens to
   receive something is not specified. (But see below.) It
   SHOULD NOT send anything. (But see below.)

- if offered sendonly, it may answer recvonly or inactive.
   Which to answer is unspecified and up to it.
   It then does not send anything. If it answered recvonly
   it should receive. What it does with the stuff it receives
   is up to it.

- if offered recvonly, it may answer sendonly or inactive.
   Which to answer is unspecified and up to it.
   It should expect not to receive anything. What it should do
   if it happens to receive something is not specified. (But
   see below.) If it answered sendonly, then it MAY send. Where
   it gets the stuff it sends is up to it.

- if offered sendrecv, it may answer with any of the four
   directionalities. Which to answer is unspecified and up to it.
   It then sends and receives according to its answer, as above.
   As always, where it gets the stuff it sends,
   and what it does with the stuff it receives is up to it.

ICE and NAT traversal lead to a requirement to violate the 
directionality requirements slightly. For inactive and recvonly, you may 
still need to send occasionally - a STUN packet, or a noop packet, or 
perhaps some comfort noise. I haven't been following this closely, so I 
won't try to spell this out in detail. But the point is to trickle 
something to keep a NAT binding open for traffic in the reverse 
direction. The flip side of that is that one should be prepared to 
receive this traffic, and presumably ignore it. (Well, for STUN, you 
would have to respond to it.)

None of this expects or requires one side to know that the other side 
has "put it on hold". In fact, it is impossible to know that, since 
these directionality attributes are needed for other call flows that 
have nothing to do with hold.

I haven't read it recently. But from memory I believe that 3264 is 
probably over-reaching in its statements about hold. At best I think 
they should be *examples* of what one *might* do upon local invocation 
of a HOLD feature.

I agree with you.

Yes.

Well, given that a B2BUA can do pretty much anything, I agree with you.
To the extent that the B2BUA is trying to be mostly transparent, and 
"just trying to help", I think it will be making a mistake to do this. 
There are many cases where butting in and sending something, in lieu of 
the endpoint doing so, will be just plain wrong. Of course, if the B2BUA 
knows its UAs well, and is certain there are no such cases, then this 
may be appropriate for it to do. But not in general.

So I agree with you here, except that I don't think the other case is 
any stronger than this one.

Hi Richard

It really is up to the algorithm that's implemented in the phone to
control the re-home to primary behavior.

Possibly you could set the expires time on the SIP-SRST registrar to a
short value - and maybe this would trigger the phones to do a periodic
re-evaluate?
Possibly you could go kill the SIP-SRST service itself as an alternative
to power cycling the ethernet power?

Note that the effect of power cycling the phone is simply to force the
phone to re-evaluate which Proxy/Registrar it wants to register to. So
what you really need is some less brute-force way to trigger the phone
to do the re-evaluate - which has to be phone vendor specific I think.

But the intent of SIP-SRST is to be a safe haven for any phone that has
been stranded by it's primary Registrar/Proxy (for whatever reason) - so
if the phone requests service - then SIP-SRST is going to grant it if it
can.=20

It's not the job of SIP-SRST to attempt to evaluate the "in-service"
state or availability of the phone's primary Registrar/Proxy - often
SIP-SRST does not even know who the primary is. Note that there is no
requirement that the SIP-SRST router is in the physical network path
between the phone and its primary Registrar/Proxy.

Just so you know we are using Polycom IP500 phones and Cisco 2801 =
routers.

On the first point about the expire times I agree.  I have considered =
something similar to that.  The problem that I have experienced has been =
that any time I lower the registration time on my router in my sip.cfg =
file the phones won't register to it.  In fact if I modify almost any =
setting with regards to the router registration they won't register to =
it.  I think I'm going to try and re-evaluate this though it's been some =
time and I've learned alot since then.

I can lower the registration time on the phones with regards to the =
phone system.  That has actually been nice.  My phones will essentially =
fail over to the router after only 10 or 20 seconds.  That makes SIP =
SRST more functional.

With regards to disabling SRST:  Unfortunately even if you stop the SRST =
service and remove all the code from the Cisco routers the phones stay =
registered to it.  If the phone is rebooted from that point it won't =
register to the router.  Obviously that doesn't help with this problem =
though.

Anyways thanks for the email that is good information.
Thanks,

The problem is in RFC 3264 section 8.4. It states:
"If the stream to be placed on hold was previously a sendrecv media
stream, it is placed on hold by marking it as sendonly." This sentence
is more often false then true and should not be considered normative.

I think the original intent of this text was to say that that SDP with
c=0.0.0.0 corresponds to sendonly SDP and not inactive SDP. Since
SDP with c=0.0.0.0 used to be called hold SDP, sending an offer with such
SDP was normally called putting on hold. Hence the confusion.

In generall, it would be a good idea to remove mentioning of term hold 
from
RFC 3264. Also, correspondence between SDP with c=0.0.0.0 and sendonly SDP
should be spelled out. This should not change anything in the meaning
of the RFC, but hopefully will end the hold confusion.

Hi,

Chapter 13.2.1 in RFC3261 says that, if the INVITE does not contain an =
session description offer, the response  (reliable) MUST contain an =
session description answer.

First, it is not said that the session description must be a SDP body, =
so I assume something else could be used too?

Second, assume that I want to set up a session without SDP (or, another =
type of session description)? If I include an empty Accept header (or an =
Accept header where application/sdp is not listed) I don't think the UAS =
should be mandated to include an SDP offer in the response.

So, I think the rules in 13.2.1 shall be applicable IF I am using a =
session description, but I should NOT be mandated to use session =
description.

Regards,

Christer
Ericsson

Hi,

RFC3261 says (also said in the GRUU draft) that a Contact URI shall be =
valid for requests outside of the dialog for which the Contact URI was =
created.

Currently, however, it is not possible for the creator of the Contact =
URI to indicate to the other user for how long the URI is valid, since =
the "expires" parameter is only allowed in REGISTER requests, and 3xx =
responses. So, the remote user of course assume that the URI is valid =
for the duration of the current dialog (or until a target refresh is =
recieved), but it does now know for how long the URI can be used for =
requests outside of the dialog. The GRUU draft DOES say that the URI =
ideally should be valid as long as the AOR it's associated to, but that =
may not always be the case.

My first question is: is there a reason why the "expires" parameter =
couldn't be allowed for INVITE requests and 200 responses, to indicate =
for how long the value is valid for out-of-current-dialog usage?

My second question is (assuming the "expirese" parameter could be used =
in INVITE/200): I may want the Contact URI to be valid for the duration =
of the dialog for which it was created. However, in most cases it is =
impossible to know for how long a dialog will last, in order to generate =
an "expires" value, so I wonder if it would be possible to define some =
kind of a "session" value, which means that the Contact value is valid =
only for the duration of the session for which it was generated? Maybe a =
zero value could be used to indicate this?

Regards,

Christer
Ericsson

Hi Udit,

the exchange is mostly correct: line order matters in SDP so
you should swap the c=3D and a=3D lines in the first media item.

Hi,

I just want to check if following offer-answer model is valid:

Offer:
v=3D0
o=3Dalice 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.anywhere.com
s=3D
c=3DIN IP4 host.anywhere.com
t=3D0 0
m=3Daudio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
a=3Drtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
m=3Dvideo 51372 RTP/AVP 31
a=3Drtpmap:31 H261/90000
m=3Dvideo 53000 RTP/AVP 32
a=3Drtpmap:32 MPV/90000

Answer:
v=3D0
o=3Dbob 2890844730 2890844730 IN IP4 host.example.com
s=3D
c=3DIN IP4 host.example.com
t=3D0 0
m=3Daudio 49920 RTP/AVP 0
a=3Drtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
c=3DIN IP4 host.example.com // can it send its own "c" value=20
m=3Dvideo 0 RTP/AVP 31
m=3Dvideo 53000 RTP/AVP 32
a=3Drtpmap:32 MPV/90000


Thanks,
Udit

Roman,

While I agree that 3264 could do with some cleanup, I doubt it will 
happen any time soon.

Roman,

While I agree that 3264 could do with some cleanup, I doubt it will
happen any time soon.

So, the remote user of course assume that the URI is valid for the duration of the current dialog (or until a target refresh is recieved), but it does now know for how long the URI can be used for requests outside of the dialog. The GRUU draft DOES say that the URI ideally should be valid as long as the AOR it's associated to, but that may not always be the case.

I can think of a pragmatic reason why this might be a bad thing to do:

The "expires=" parameter contains a duration, not an absolute time. This 
means that any recipient would have to timestamp it when received, and 
then recompute the expiration time any time it passed it elsewhere.

For instance, when receiving it in an INVITE, it would be timestamped. 
Then when sending a REFER, the expiration time would have to be updated 
in the Refer-To header. And then the recipient of the refer would also 
have to timestamp it, and recompute the expiration time to decide if it 
is ok to send an INVITE to it.

Of course, registrars do this, but this change would extend the pain.

> My second question is (assuming the "expirese" parameter could be used in INVITE/200): I may want the Contact URI to be valid for the duration of the dialog for which it was created. However, in most cases it is impossible to know for how long a dialog will last, in order to generate an "expires" value, so I wonder if it would be possible to define some kind of a "session" value, which means that the Contact value is valid only for the duration of the session for which it was generated? Maybe a zero value could be used to indicate this?

IMO this is a solution looking for a problem. Do we have a problem where 
we need to know when Contacts expire?

So you want to set up a session that has no description? Why would you 
want to do that?

That seems *so* wrong! The whole point of INVITE is to negotiate the 
details of the session.

Yes, you could use something else besides SDP - the obvious candidate is 
SDPng. But using none doesn't seem to fit the intent of INVITE.

You can get much the effect you seem to be seeking simply by using SDP 
that has no m= lines.

Yes.  But I do not believe that any other form of session description
has been standardized.

Why would you want to have a dialog with no session description?

Though with the advent of MESSAGE, it is possible that one could
establish a SIP dialog entirely to be able to pass MESSAGE requests, and
thus need no "media" at all.

Section 20.1 makes it clear that an empty Accept header means that no
body formats are acceptable, whereas a missing Accept header is
equivalent to "application/sdp".

> So, I think the rules in 13.2.1 shall be applicable IF I am using a

> description.

The last paragraphs of section 13.2.1 make it clear that a session
description is mandatory only if there is an explicit or implicit
"Content-Disposition: session" header.  Checking section 20.11 and the
IANA registrations (http://www.iana.org/assignments/mail-cont-disp), it
does not appear that there is a Content-Disposition that means "no
content", but the values "alert", "icon", and "render" would seem safe
to use with an empty body.  Perhaps a new value "none" is needed?

Do you have an application where all this is a serious consideration?
If so, you might want to lobby for standardizing "Content-Disposition:
none".

These seem to be valid concerns, but I don't see any good way to satisfy
them -- in most cases, when a URI ceases to be valid can't be predicted
until very close to the moment in question.

You might want to look at the TRUU work, which addresses some of these
questions.  You can start with http://www.ietf.org/mail-
archive/web/sip/current/msg12083.html

Can't a Contact be "de-Registered" at any time?  (Register with
Expires=3D0)

If so, then any assertion prior to that becomes false.  Then it doesn't
really matter what you try to tell a remote node, there is a chance it
is false.  So, why bother?  Or, put another way, why is this needed?

This would be an abuse of INVITE. INVITE creates an *invite dialog 
usage* and as a side effect also may create a dialog. If all you want is 
a dialog within which to send MESSAGE, then you don't need the invite 
dialog usage.

There are currently two kinds of dialog usage: invite & subscribe. 
Neither of these is right if all you want is to send MESSAGEs. That is a 
hint that you are doing something wrong. If you wanted to do that, then 
the right thing to do would be to come up with a new 
message-dialog-usage and a way to establish it. But there would be 
resistance to that - there is resistance to the whole concept of using 
MESSAGEs within a dialog as a message session. It was considered and 
rejected in favor of MSRP.

What is an "invite dialog usage"?  I haven't seen that term.  Presumably
it means more than "a dialog started by an INVITE".

Hmmm, but I see that MSRP is set up using SDP, so it doesn't give an
example of a different body-content for INVITE.

I don't think so. The intent of the paragraphs at the end of 13.2.1 was 
to say that presence of a jpg in an INVITE does NOT mean that the jpg is 
the offer. This doesnt mean that its ok to do a SIP INVITE exchange 
without exchanging session descriptions. Indeed, I think the current 
text would forbid it (certainly, that was the intent). Note the following:


The Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 2327 [1]) MUST be
    supported by all user agents as a means to describe sessions, and its
    usage for constructing offers and answers MUST follow the procedures
    defined in [13].

This means that the Accept header field has to be either absent 
(implying support only for SDP), or present and include SDP. It cannot 
be present and list nothing. As a consqeuence, lack of an offer in the 
INVITE will trigger an offer in the first reliable response.

I'm new here, and I can't say what the intent was, but if you read that
sentence closely, it does not say that setting up a session with SDP is
mandatory in all INVITEs.  All it says is that the UA must be able to do
so with SDP, and if it does use SDP, it must do so according to [13].

In regard to the Accept header, section 20.1 says (in part):

   20.1 Accept

   An empty Accept header field means that no formats are acceptable.

Perhaps an empty Accept header is forbidden elsewhere, but I haven't
seen such a statement.

Christer,

I can think of at least 2 reasons why an 'expires' parameter for a Contact 
header in INVITE would not be that useful:

1. The time period for which a Contact address is valid is (currently at 
least) not under control of the UA (i.e. not known). The UA may propose a 
desired limit on the period for which the Contact is ~used~ by another 
party, but it has no way of enforcing this.

A possible way to remedy this is described here: 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jbemmel-sip-truu-01.txt

2. What would the other party do with this information (i.e. when the 
Contact expires)?

As it currently is (and as IMO it should be ) it is up to the UA inserting 
the Contact header to make sure it is valid at least for the lifetime of the 
dialog. If it becomes invalid, the UA must send a new Contact (e.g. through 
UPDATE or re-INVITE); a typical use case is a mobile terminal which changes 
its IP address. In other words, the responsibility is with the UA that 
provides the contact, not with the entity using that contact. This is 
similar to the UA's responsibility to re-register before the registration 
expires.

Regarding a kind of flag to hint the other party that the Contact should not 
be used outside the dialog, like:
Contact: <user@123.123.123.123>;use=dialog

I think that this is what most UAs assume by default anyway (except perhaps 
newer ones that recognise 'Supported: gruu' )

Regards,

Jeroen

I thought dialog usage was discussed in either 3261 or 3265, but I can't 
find it right now. In any case it is a not widely understood.

There are dialogs, and there are things that use dialogs: invites and 
subscriptions. The dialog itself has a certain amount of state 
associated with it. Then each usage has some added state. So, a dialog 
has: route set, target address, callid, local and remote CSeq, ...

A subscribe dialog usage has: a direction (is this a subscriber or 
notifier), event type, event id, expiration time, ...

An invite dialog usage has very little state of its own. I think you can 
probably consider offer/answer state to be part of this, maybe the most 
recent offered and answered sdp.

Right, because that is just a bad idea. Doing MSRP as a real media 
stream within a session made it fit into the overall model better.

[CHH] I don't think the issue is when the Contact is used within the =
dialog. Also, in that case it is possible (as you also indicate) to =
update it using an UPDATE/re-INVITe. The issue is when it's used outside =
the dialog.

[CHH] GRUU is what I had in mind, eventhough I believe 3261 does not =
forbid a "normal" Contact to also be use outside the dialog.

Hi,

The issus is not whether the UA entity supports SDP or not, but more if =
it's mandatory to use for all sessions.

Eventhough it's called session description, SIP usess SDP mainly for =
MEDIA description (SIP headers and parameters are used to identity the =
SIP session). So, the questions is whether an INVITE initiated dialog =
MUST contain media.

Yes, it is possible to send an SDP without m=3D lines, so if SDP really =
is mandated I guess one would have to use that. I just think it would be =
a little unecessary to include such SDP if the UA knows that there will =
be no media during the dialog.

Regards,

Christer

True. But, offer/answer state is needed only when you DO use SDP.

No. offer/answer state is needed when you exchange offers and answers, 
whether you use SDP, SDPng, or something else yet to be invented.

The primary *purpose* of the INVITE is to initiate the exchange of 
offers and answers. I believe it is required to do so.

If you don't need the state of the invite dialog usage, then you don't 
need the INVITE. That was my point in bringing up dialog usages. If all 
you want to do is exchange MESSAGEs within a dialog, then you should 
create some new way to establish a message-dialog-usage.

This is not remarkable. Look back at the history of MMUSIC. SDP predates 
SIP. SDP stands for Session Description Protocol, while SIP stands for 
Session Initiation Protocol. I don't think it is a coincidence that they 
both use *session* in their name, and for the most part we should assume 
that they intend to mean the same thing by it.

So SIP initiates sessions by exchanging their descriptions.

Yes, I think that is the way it is.

If you look back at 2543, it said that you distinguished whether a 
request contained an offer or not by whether the body contained an m= 
line. That got pretty ugly, and certainly wasn't easily extensible to 
other forms of session description. So it was changed to be based on a 
the presence of a body part with Content-Disposition of session.

That change admitted the possibility of establishing a session with no 
media - via a session description that specifies no media. This is a 
degenerate case, but a potentially useful one - primarily as an 
intermediate state when it is known that communication is desired but 
the media to be used has not been decided.

The only SIP signalling specific related to offer/answer is that you can't have two outstanding re-INVITEs, but even that you can achieve without an offer/answer state machine (all you need to know is that you have an ongoing re-INVITE transaction).

You also cannot have two outstanding offers. E.g. you cannot send an 
INVITE with an offer, and then follow it with an UPDATE containing 
another offer before receiving an answer.

I don't think we need to get into the details of what state is required 
to implement the protocol correctly. It is sufficient to say that there 
is *some* state that is required because of INVITE and offer/answer. And 
this is specific to INVITE, over and above the state required for 
dialogs in general.

I discussed this further in an earlier message.

I don't think it is "easier" to change the defintion of INVITE in a way 
that will probably break many/most UA implementations, in order to 
support doing something that probably shouldn't be done.

The whole situation is rather perverse.  In theory, the Contact (a/k/a
target) value was supposed to be globally routable and valid for a long
time.  Even within 3261, it was realized that the Contact might change
during the dialog, and so re-INVITE was admitted.

But as J. Rosenberg says in draft-ietf-sip-gruu-05:

   RFC 3261 mandates that a user agent populate the Contact header field
   in INVITE requests and responses with a URI that is global (meaning
   that it can be used from any element connected to the Internet), and
   that routes to the user agent which inserted it.  RFC 3261 also
   mandates that this URI be valid for requests sent outside of the
   dialog in which the Contact URI was inserted.

   In practice, these requirements have proven very difficult to meet.
   Few endpoints have a hostname that is is present in DNS.  Many
   endpoints have an IP address that is private because the client is
   behind a NAT. [...]

   Because of these difficulties, most clients have actually been
   inserting URIs into the Contact header field of requests and
   responses with the form sip:<IP-address>.  These have the property of
   routing to the client, but they are generally only reachable from the
   proxy to which the user is directly connected.

So in practice, Contact values may easily have a period of validity that
is zero.

Alternatively, if the Contact is a GRUU (indicated by "Supported: gruu"
in the request/response), you know that it will be valid and for a long
time.

TRUUs have their own rules, and are valid for the duration of the dialog
within which they are used.

But in all of these cases, there isn't any particularly useful
*additional* knowledge to be gained by the UA attempting to specify the
time period for which the Contact will be valid.  So I think this
"expires" value is one of those ideas which is useful in a theoretical
sense, but the vicissitudes of real SIP deployments prevent it from
doing much useful in practice.

Dale

Hmmm... I get the feeling that there are a lot of loose ends in this
discussion, and different people are grabbing different loose ends,
which is confusing the discussion.  Let me try to enumerate what seem to
me to be the essential factors.

It may be that when INVITE was defined, nobody envisioned that it might
be used to establish a dialog that did not have a "media
session" (described by SDP or something similar).  But there seems to be
nothing in the standards to prevent someone from doing so, nor any
reason that proxies or other infrastructure agents would fail to process
them correctly.

There is no currently known purpose for which such a session-less
dialog is better than other existing mechanisms.  (In particular,
applications should avoid sending streams of requests, to avoid
overloading proxies.)

Trying to establish such a dialog with a current UA will probably fail.
(But that is of no consequence, as no current UA intends to use such
dialogs.)

There is the concept of "dialog usages", which doesn't seem to have been
discussed much in recent times, or mentioned in the RFCs, but it is a
useful concept for discussing particular subsets of the functioning of a
dialog.  Currently, there is "invite usage" (embracing media
negotiation), and "subscribe usage" (embracing a subscription and its
notices).  A dialog can contain several usages simultaneously.  E.g., a
REFER in an INVITE-initiated dialog creates a subscribe usage, or a
SUBSCRIBE-initiated dialog can have several further SUBSCRIBEs sent
within it, so the dialog contains several subscribe usages.  Some
operations can affect multiple aspects of a dialog -- for instance, a
re-INVITE can change the media session of the invite usage, but also
change the target address, which affects all usages (as well as outside-
of-usage within-dialog requests like OPTIONS).

Nonetheless, there are ways that INVITE-initiated dialogs differ
substantially from other dialogs that is not a consequence of usages --
INVITE operates in a way consonant with human attention, generating
(with assistance from proxies) only one dialog (despite forking), and
tolerating long dialog set-up times.  Other requests that initiate
dialogs are expected to complete quickly and proxies allow them to
initiate multiple dialogs.  These features may be orthogonal to the uses
to which dialogs are put once they are established, which would suggest
decoupling the usages within a dialog from the type of request
(INVITE/non-INVITE) used to create it.

Dale,

I was agreeing with your summary until the very end. See comment down 
there. I'm changing the subject line because we have gotten off the 
original subject.

This is not true. It is only the invite-dialog-usage that differs from 
other kinds of dialog-usages. It is the usage that has the alerting 
associated with it, not the dialog.

If there is forking, then one INVITE can generate multiple dialogs. 
Usually most of them are just early dialogs, but that needn't be the 
case. And forking of SUBSCRIBE can also result in multiple dialogs.

Most of the time, when speaking (loosely) about a dialog, people are 
really talking about a combination of a dialog-usage plus the 
corresponding dialog.

There are a bunch of weird things that are possible, but that nobody 
ever tries, that would make all these distinctions clearer. E.g.

- establish a dialog with SUBSCRIBE, then send an INVITE within it

- establish a dialog with INVITE, then send a SUBSCRIBE within it.
   Then send BYE for the INVITE but keep the subscription active,
   hence keeping the dialog alive. Then, send another INVITE within
   the dialog.

- send an INVITE that parallel forks. Receive 180 from both forks,
   and PRACK both of them. Then send a SUBSCRIBE (perhaps to the
   dialog event package) in each dialog. When one of them answers
   with a 200, the proxy will cancel the other INVITE. You will
   then have one dialog with an INVITE and a SUBSCRIBE, and another
   dialog with just a SUBSCRIBE.

Most of these implications were apparently missed when 3261 was put 
together. The authors hate it, and there are efforts to deprecate the 
shared use of dialogs. Personally, I think it never should have been 
there, but the cat is out of the bag, and there is no way of getting it 
back in the bag.

OTOH, if you try these corner cases, I will be surprised if you very 
often get success. It certainly isn't something people are likely to 
test for. But it is still useful to understand what the model is.

I am aware of people who have established subscriptions to the same 
event package in both directions over the same dialog. (And it didn't 
work the first time they tried.)

> - establish a dialog with SUBSCRIBE, then send an INVITE within it

Oddly enough, I never thought of this before.

And I'm NOT recommending it now.

But here's something to think about:

In OMA's PoC architecture, some mobile UAs have long-lived relationships 
with network UAs called "Participating Functions", (PF). In the current 
spec, the mobile UA at start time sends an INVITE to its PF and 
establishes a dialog. This dialog is basically used like a conference 
call. When the mobile UA wants to talk to somebody else, the mobile UA 
sends a REFER within that dialog to the PF, with the Refer-To: pointing 
at the target, and the PF then generates an INVITE to the target. For 
calls in the other direction, the PF gets the INVITE and informs the 
mobile UA of the new call via a conference-package-like NOTIFY, 
generally accepting the INVITE after the mobile UA sends 200 for the 
NOTIFY (but sometimes not -- in the interest of performance tweaking, it 
can respond speculatively and send an "unconfirmed indication").

Why all the trickiness? This gives us an in-network high-bandwidth point 
that can manage (and serialize) concurrent flows to the mobile, so that 
the mobile's tiny-little-capillary bandwidth doesn't get logjammed. It 
also lets us fake-out some of the user-experience of latency that might 
otherwise occur. The PF acts as a signaling-and-media B2BUA to gain this 
control. It also keeps us from having to send media descriptions 
over-the-air for every call (ostensibly saving tons of bandwidth) -- the 
long-lived INVITE negotiates the offer-answer options for all later 
calls on that side.

But I'm starting to speculate how this might look if the long-lived 
dialog were established via a SUBSCRIBE (perhaps to a new event package) 
and calls were set up by sending INVITE within that dialog, instead of 
REFER. Hmmm.

True, the difference is not absolute.  But in an INVITE situation, the
proxies attempt to prevent the establishment of more than one confirmed
dialog, whereas in a SUBSCRIBE situation, they are forbidden from trying
to prune the set of dialogs.  In various cases, this makes various sorts
of difference.

They are? That is news to me. Where is that specified?

I think there is less difference than people think.

Hi,

If UAC wants to change its contact address i.e. target set, as per RFC 
3261, UAC ca nsedn REINVITE for that.

Is it possible to send Re-INVITE without any sdp, as it does not want to 
change any media or renegotiate any media,

because if send without SDP, then UAS can consider it as asking for offer.

Thanks,
Udit

It is possible to send a re-INVITE without SDP, but in that case the UAS =
is mandated to send an SDP offer to you. There are different =
understandings on how that offer shall be contstructed, though.

But, another way is to include SDP in the re-INVITE, and to keep the =
version part of the SDP origin parameter unchanged, which indicates that =
the session description is unchanged.

Hi all,

I have a question about "491 Request Pending"

RFC 3261 says:

21.4.27 491 Request Pending

   The request was received by a UAS that had a pending request within
   the same dialog.  Section 14.2 describes how such "glare" situations
   are resolved.

so, my question is: Is is acceptable for UAS to get  "491 Request 
Pending" for for some other than INVITE and UPDATE requests? If not,  I 
suppose if UAS receives  491 for non-INVITE (or outside a dialog)- it 
should be treated as general 4xx.


Thanks in advance.

in my opinion, it is no practical to require that a company would supply
private keying material regarding its domain to whoever party that
happens to host its sip proxy service.  that simply does not happen.

if sip srv record of, say, cisco.com, points to sip.provider.com, then
it must suffice that sip.provider.com uses its own keying material to
sign the identity of cisco.com users.

and even if sip.provider.com proxy would posses keying material of
domain cisco.com, i don't understand how it could know which server
certificate it should present to a sip ua when it establishes tls
connection with the proxy, because that happens before the sip ua has
sent any sip requests and because it is impractical to require that each
domain would have its own ip address or port at the proxy.

it may be that i'm missing something, but if not, it makes no sense for
ietf to write specifications that cannot have real world
implementations.

Hi all,

I need to know if a UA can send 181 response. In RFC 3261, it is given
that this response will be sent by a server and no mention about UAs.

RFC 3959 defines 'early-session' as a new disposition type value for the
Content-Disposition header field and registers it at the IANA:
 http://www.iana.org/assignments/mail-cont-disp

Why the 'disp-type' ABNF rule, defined in RFC3261:
 disp-type = "render" / "session" / "icon" / "alert" /
              disp-extension-token

is not modified accordingly in this RFC?

Note that the same occurs with RFC3893 that defines the 'aib' value...


Is it correct to define the current disp-type rule as:
 disp-type = "render" / "session" / "icon" / "alert" /
             "early-session" / "aib" / disp-extension-token


Thanks

Suganya,

RFC 3261 section 6 defines the server, UA and UAS:

Server: A server is a network element that receives requests in
         order to service them and sends back responses to those
         requests.  Examples of servers are proxies, *user agent servers*,
         redirect servers, and registrars.

User Agent (UA): A logical entity that can act as both a user
         agent client and *user agent server*.

User Agent Server (UAS): A user agent server is a logical entity
         that generates a response to a SIP request.  The response
         accepts, rejects, or redirects the request.  This role lasts
         only for the duration of that transaction.  In other words, if
         a piece of software responds to a request, it acts as a UAS for
         the duration of that transaction.  If it generates a request
         later, it assumes the role of a user agent client for the
         processing of that transaction.

So, if UA can provide the call forwarding like service, which can 
generate the 181 response. Then, this UA is taking the UAS role and is 
one type of server.

Regards,
Bourne

My take is that since disp-extension-token effectively includes the =20
set of disposition-type values registered with IANA that your more =20
detailed grammar is syntactically equivalent.

That's why not every SIP extension requires us to replace the grammar =20=

used in RFC 3261.

I would say the contact is valid as long as the dialog that it was

The issue behind this discussion is that a contact may be valid also =
after the dialog has been terminated.

SIPPING Working Group: Please consider the following "P-header expert  
review" and let us know if you have any issues with it or further  
suggestions to make.

----------

Publication of draft-camarillo-sipping-user-database-01.txt as an  
informational document defining P-headers has been requested. Under  
the terms of RFC 3427, this requires addressing the following 7  
requirements:


   1.  A designated expert (as defined in RFC 2434 [4]) MUST review the
        proposal for applicability to SIP and conformance to these
        guidelines.  The Expert Reviewer will send email to the  
Transport
        Area Directors on this determination.  The expert reviewer can
        cite one or more of the guidelines that haven't been followed in
        his/her opinion.

Dean Willis was selected as the designated expert for this review. As  
per the current practice, the resulting review will have been  
discussed in the SIP community via the SIPPING working group's  
mailing list and evaluated for rough technical consensus before  
reporting a conclusive positive review to the Area Directors.

    2.  The proposed extension MUST NOT define SIP option tags, response
        codes, or methods.

The reviewed document defines one "P-header" without an option tag,  
response code, or method, and therefore satisfies this requirement.

    3.  The function of the proposed header MUST NOT overlap with  
current
        or planned chartered extensions.

The proposed header provides for the communication of locally-valid  
state information between two proxies in the IMS environment as  
defined by 3GPP. It does not appear to relate in any significant way  
to any ongoing, planned, proposed, or even whimsically discussed work  
of the IETF known to the reviewer, and therefore satisfies this  
requirement.


    4.  The proposed header MUST be of a purely informational nature,  
and
        MUST NOT significantly change the behavior of SIP entities which
        support it.  Headers which merely provide additional information
        pertinent to a request or a response are acceptable.  If the
        headers redefine or contradict normative behavior defined in
        standards track SIP specifications, that is what is meant by
        significantly different behavior.

The proposed header conveys information about the back-end database  
used by the originating proxy to a receiving proxy in the same IMS  
operator domain. This prevents the receiving proxy from having to  
repeat the resolution process used by the first proxy. In the absence  
of this extension, the resulting call flow would be identical, but  
would require one additional database operation. Consequently, the  
proposed extension appears to be consistent with the intent of this  
requirement.

    5.  The proposed header MUST NOT undermine SIP security in any  
sense.
        The Internet Draft proposing the new header MUST address  
security
        issues in detail as if it were a Standards Track document.  Note
        that, if the intended application scenario makes certain
        assumptions regarding security, the security considerations only
        need to meet the intended application scenario rather than the
        general Internet case.  In any case, security issues need to be
        discussed for arbitrary usage scenarios (including the general
        Internet case).

The proposed extension header, "P-User-Database" applies only in IMS  
environments where the originating proxy (The P-CSCF) and the  
terminating proxy (the S-CSCF) exist in a protected environment  
sharing a mutual frame of reference to the database in question. The  
security relationship between these elements is defined by the IMS  
sprcifications.

The text given as the "Security Consideration" section of the  
reviewed document follows:

    "The P-User-Database defined in this document is to be used in an
    environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are not
    supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those
    elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes
    achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protecting the
    network.  In any case, the environment where the P-User-Database
    header field will be used ensures the integrity and the
    confidentiality of the contents of this header field."

While the above text is believed correct, this reviewer finds these  
considerations to provide inadequate guidance to future readers of  
this specification who may not be conversant with the characteristics  
of IMS. No explicit reference to IMS is made by the reviewed  
document, and the characteristics of IMS that make the proposed  
extension viable are not elucidated by the reviewed document. This  
could be corrected by an explicit reference to IMS specifications,  
and by the inclusion in the revisions to the reviewed document of a  
summary elucidation of the relevant characteristics of IMS:

* The "P-User-Database" header field is inserted by a proxy element  
referred to as P-CSCF.

* The "P-User-Database" header field is consumed and removed by a  
proxy element referred to as S-CSCF.

* Both P-CSCF and S-CSCF are under the administrative control of a  
single operator, and share a common frame of reference to the  
database indicated by the P-User-Database header field.

The preceding elucidations or equivalent material should be contained  
in the "Applicability Statement" section of the final RFC.

* There is a slight security risk if the the P-User-Database header  
field is allowed is allowed to propagate out of the domain bounded by  
the administrative control of that operator. No user-sensitive  
information would be revealed by such a breach, but this could result  
in disclosure of information about the topology of the operator  
network that goes beyond the level of disclosure explicit in SIP  
messages without this extension. Consequently, operators my wish to  
be diligent about removal of the P-User-Database header field before  
sending a request containing it to other network operators or to user  
equipment.

The preceding elucidation or equivalent material should be contained  
in the "Security Considerations" section of the final RFC.


   6.  The proposed header MUST be clearly documented in an (Individual
        or Working Group) Informational RFC, and registered with IANA.

The reviewed document is intended to become the informational RFC  
required by this consideration. Acceptance of this document for  
publication as an informational RFC will address this requirement.

    7.  An applicability statement in the Informational RFC MUST clearly
        document the useful scope of the proposal, and explain its
        limitations and why it is not suitable for the general use of  
SIP
        in the Internet.

The reviewed document contains an applicability statement. This  
reviewer finds he current applicability statement inadequate, and has  
discussed additional material earlier in this review that if added  
should make the applicability statement adequate to address this  
consideration.



Note: It has been suggested to this reviewer that the proposed  
extension header field would benefit from the inclusion of extension  
parameter syntax, which has become the common practice for SIP  
extensions. Therefore it is suggested that the syntax be amended as  
follows:

OLD:
P-User-Database     = "P-User-Database" HCOLON database

NEW:
P-User-Database     = "P-User-Database" HCOLON database
                       *( SEMI generic-param )

Further note:

The document makes explicit reference to RFC 2119, but does not  
invoke any of the language of that RFC. For consistency with the  
current practices relating to informational-track documents,  
reference to RFC 2119 and the associated language definition section  
should be removed from revisions to the reviewed document.


Conclusion: While the proposed extension header is consistent with  
the requirements of RFC 3427, the document as reviewed fails to  
satisfactorily address the "Applicability Statement" and "Security  
Considerations" requirements of that RFC, requires two additional  
content modifications (syntax change and removal of RFC 2119  
references) and is therefore remanded to the author for revision.

Pulver.com has offered to provide reasonable accomodations for ad-hoc  
or supplemental working group meetings in conjunction with their VON  
and IP.4.IT shows. The next IP.4.IT is scheduled for the week after  
IETF 64, and will be located in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Rio Hotel  
and Casino.

Does anyone have a need for a supplemental WG or ad-hoc meeting that  
week and want to meet in Las Vegas?

Howdy all,
I'm using Windows Messanger 5.1 SIP Client to register to my TCP Registrar Server but i'm unable to authenticate with DIGEST-MD5 to the MS Directory Server. 
Has anybody experienced such a case?
I've read that Windows Messanger is not RFC3261 based. ( I think it's generated digest-response is not compatible with ldap server.  )
I'm reading this SIP digest-response from messanger and send the RFC2831 MD5 response to the ldap server in my Registrar Server.
 
Helps Appriciated,

I am connecting to the server through clinet socket program written in C.
I am sending INVITE request and I am getting 100 trying and 200 OK  then I am sending ACK in return to 200 Ok.
Now I am trying to listen at the port which the server had sent along with 200 OK SDP. but I am only getting UDP packets(when displayed non human readable characters are displayed) where I was expecting RTP packets. Can anyone tell me hopw to interpret these UDP packets.
 
I wish to create RTP stream..can any one help in knowing How to create RTP stream?
 
With Regards,
Rajesh

Hi

If u use MESSAGE method, then there is no need to establish session with
INVITE. But if u use MSRP which is session based IM, then u need to
establish session with INVITE prior to using MSRP.=20

Subject: [Sip] MESSAGE method

Hi all,

I am extending the SIP stack I have implemented in accordance with RFC
3261.

I need to add support for Instant Messaging. I am following RFC 3428 Do
I need to establish a session with INVITE for sending Instant Messages?

RFC 3428 does not talk about it.

draft-rosenberg-simple-im-transport-00.txt has an example of sending
MESSAGE method.

It first sends an INVITE with an sdp body containing m=3Dmessage
987654321(session id) IMTP/TCP text/plain.

After receiving 200 OK, it sends MESSAGE method. The call-id in INVITE
and MESSAGE method is not matching in this example.

What I interpret is, in order to know that the target supports Instant
Messaging, INVITE is sent. Otherwise INVITE is not necessary and MESSAGE
can be sent directly.

Am I correct?

Regards,
B.Suganya

Hello,

We are interested in implementing 'hot desking' feature in our SIP proxy
server. I'd like to ask if there is any RFC or similar document which I 
can refer to get an idea of how we can go about doing this. Apologies if
this is not the right list to post to. 

Could anyone possibly give us some pointers to the subject?

Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Suha Cubukcuoglu

OK kids, as usual I'm looking forward to pulling together the agenda  
for our upcoming meeting in Vancouver.

As usual, I'd like to dedicate a significant chunk of time to the  
various chartered deliverables that, as usual, we're behind on.

So, what else do you want to talk about?

Please send me suggestions, which I'll post onto the SIP supplemental  
web site in the usual place. I'll send a link once I start posting them.

Gonzalo's HTML format works pretty well, so please fill in the  
following for each request (replace the CAPSTRINGS):

<tr>
   <td><a href="mailto:YOURADDRESS">YOUR NAME</a></td>
   <td>YOUR TOPIC</td>
   <td><a href="http://POINTERTOTHEDRAFT">THENAMEOFTHEDRAFT</a></td>
   <td>TIMEYOUTHINKYOUNEEDINMINUTES</td>
</tr>

like maybe:

<tr>
   <td><a href="mailto:dean.willis@softarmor.com">Dean Willis</a></td>
   <td>Answer mode extensions</td>
   <td><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip- 
answeralert-01.txt">
draft-willis-sip-answeralert-01</a></td>
   <td>15</td>
</tr>


Thanks, all.

If we're still doing this for 65 (instead of using IETF Tools), I  
think I'll put up a web form.

Dean

Could you describe what "hot desking" is?

Good question.

SIP only. 

I believe Gonzalo will be trolling for SIPPING.

If you make an agenda request and it fails to show up, please bug me.

I can see the attraction, but I'm not sure you'd save much.  By the
offer-answer model and all the machinery, you could still have only one
INVITE dialog-usage within the dialog at a time.  Using INVITEs would
allow you to periodically re-negotiate the media, but they would also
*require* you to re-negotiate the media every time you made a call.
(And you've noted that your lords and masters think that's a Bad Idea.)

How about ox and ass in double harness?  Continue to use REFER to
redirect the ultimate endpoint of the call, but use re-INVITE (in the
future) when the phone and/or its base station decides it needs to re-
negotiate the media.  That would actually make sense for a phone that
transitions between 3G and WiFi usage, and even more so once WiMax
becomes popular.

Actually, I really meant IETF LC, because Rohan dropped a note on me  
saying he thought it was ready to send to Allison, and I had a vague  
recollection of WGLCing it like 3 revs back . . . Rohan, are you  
playing games with my head again, darn you!

So it looks like we need to do WGLC instead.  That's why I try to ask  
before I do something completely stupid -- safety in numbers. Thanks,  
Vijay!

Makes sense to me. More sense than my crazy idea, anyhow.

Hi All,

I'm sending the SUBSCRIBE request its giving 202 and responding with NOTIFY
with no body.

I would like to know the SUBSCRIBE request should contain authorization
header.
(Note: Im sending the authorization in SUBSCRIBE)

If not,
What is the meaning of these in RFC 3856 (Chapter 4 OverView of Operation)
If authorization could not be obtained at this time, the subscription is
considered "pending", and a 202
response is returned. In both cases, the PA sends an immediate NOTIFY
message containing the state of the presentity and of the subscription.

If i want to get 200 OK what should i send with SUSCRIBE and subsequently,
to get NOTIFY with BODY.

thanks in advance

Looking forward for supportive response

Any feedback is appericated.

Hi Sudhir

I have not read RFC 3856, but according to subscribe-notify RFC, i think
the UA getting 202 can't do anything to get back 200... It shouldn't send
another SUBSCRIBE.
It should just wait for another NOTIFY with state as active/terminated.
By 202, the UAS means that subscription is validated, but going further
notifier may/may not reject the subscription.

Hi All,


I'm sending the SUBSCRIBE request its giving 202 and responding with NOTIFY
with no body.


I would like to know the SUBSCRIBE request should contain authorization
header.
(Note: Im sending the authorization in SUBSCRIBE)


If not,
What is the meaning of these in RFC 3856 (Chapter 4 OverView of Operation)


If authorization could not be obtained at this time, the subscription is
considered "pending", and a 202
response is returned. In both cases, the PA sends an immediate NOTIFY
message containing the state of the presentity and of the subscription.




If i want to get 200 OK what should i send with SUSCRIBE and subsequently,
to get NOTIFY with BODY.


thanks in advance


Looking forward for supportive response


Any feedback is appericated.

Hi
    getting 202 does not mean subscription is validated. It means
subscription is accepted. But only upon receiving NOTIFY, it is
confirmed that subscription is active.=20
U cannot get 200 OK for SUBSCRIBE. =20

Hi Sudhir

I have not read RFC 3856, but according to subscribe-notify RFC, i think
the UA getting 202 can't do anything to get back 200... It shouldn't
send another SUBSCRIBE.
It should just wait for another NOTIFY with state as active/terminated.
By 202, the UAS means that subscription is validated, but going further
notifier may/may not reject the subscription.

You may get a 200 response (which means that the subscription has been
authorized and you will eventually receive a NOTIFY with contents), but
the subscriber cannot force the notifier to produce 200.  See section
3.1.4.1 of RFC 3265:

   This SUBSCRIBE request will be confirmed with a final response.
   200-class responses indicate that the subscription has been accepted,
   and that a NOTIFY will be sent immediately.  A 200 response indicates
   that the subscription has been accepted and that the user is
   authorized to subscribe to the requested resource.  A 202 response
   merely indicates that the subscription has been understood, and that
   authorization may or may not have been granted.

Right.

We have in fact discussed this a few times. As a general rule, its 
preferable to not include information in the URI itself which describes 
the properties of the resource to which the URI points.

In all of these cases, I don't think the recipient of the URI would do 
anything differently if it knew it was a gruu, as opposed to if it 
didnt. A GRUU is just a URI that has the property that URIs in Refer-To, 
contact and PIDF need to have in order to work right anyway. To date, we 
havent had a way to produce those URI reliably. Now we do.

Actually, if anything, I'd argue that it really ought not be necesary to 
know its a gruu to use it, and thus the requirement is more than we need.

I think its right as written. The idea is that, if the proxy had put 
itself into the Path, then it will already be in the signaling chain for 
mid-dialog requests towards the client. Thus, it shouldn't be in the 
record-route set that is used to reach the client. That is the 
record-route set used by the other side. Thus, the record-route needs to 
be removed from the response.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Juha,

As has been pointed out on this mailing list before, this constraint =
already exists in the core SIP standard. Specifically, in RFC3263. (From =
4.1)

   For NAPTR records with SIPS protocol fields, (if the server is using
   a site certificate), the domain name in the query and the domain name
   in the replacement field MUST both be valid based on the site
   certificate handed out by the server in the TLS exchange.=20

If you send a request to a URI of the form sips:user@sip.example.com, =
then the certificate of the responding server (which is delivered via =
TLS in the backwards domain) must be for valid the domain =
'sip.example.com'. This goes even for the sorts of hosting cases where =
the DNS NAPTR/SRV records for sip.example.com point you to =
siphosting.com, and siphosting.com is the server that actually replies. =
In that instance, siphosting.com must hold a certificate valid for =
'sip.example.com'.

For us to deviate from this principle for the sip-identity draft really =
doesn't make sense, because the constraint already exists in RFC3263. =
We've gone to some trouble to make sure that the authority for a given =
domain from an identity perspective mirrors the authority over the =
domain for inbound requests to the domain.

Regarding your concern about how the hosting service would know what =
hosted domain the user agent is requesting, since as you rightly point =
out a TLS connection is formed before any SIP requests are sent, the =
same problem exists of course for HTTP. Thus, the caretakers of TLS =
wisely added a server name indication to the extended client hello, =
which defined in RFC3546 Section 3.1. So, this problem is addressed at =
the TLS layer.

I've just submitted a revision of the GRUU spec. Until it appears in the 
archives, you can pick it up at:
http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-06.txt

There is no technical change, just editorial changes made by rfc-ed.

GRUU is currently going through an rfc editor early copy editor 
experiment. In this experiment, the rfc-editor does its copy-editing of 
a draft PRIOR to the final WGLC. Once the changes are made, they are 
reviewed by the editor, and the revised draft is reposted for last call. 
That is what I am now doing.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User
                          Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the Session 
                          Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-gruu-06.txt
	Pages		: 41
	Date		: 2005-10-21
	
Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
   a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used
   by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA
   instance.  A URI that routes to a specific UA instance is called a
   Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  This document describes an
   extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a server and for
   communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-06.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-06.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

This is the follow-up on the collected feedback about SIP Response Identity=
.

Feng and I put together what seem to be some of the key questions that have
been on the list about response identity then Feng put together the start o=
f
some analysis. I thought this looked like some interesting work that might
spark some discussion on how we should solve this problem. We would
appreciate any feedback folks care to give.

Thanks, Cullen


1. Q1 and Q1.1 is about the response identity.

   Q1: Which approach is chosen to indicate the responder's identity?

       A: the responder's identity is embedded into the response
           message directly

       B: Instead of any change on response message, the responder must
           send one additional request back to the originator AND embed
           the responder's identity into the request message, RIGHT after
           the responder sends its response.

       Analysis:=20

         For A, pros:
            * no additional request or response is needed
            * works when the responder is either proxy or UA
            * relatively simple, without changing any per-dialog state

           Cons:
            * need to answer Q1.1 (see below)
            * need new development after Q1.1 (and Q3) is answered

         For B, pros:
            * no need to face Q1.1
           Cons:
            * additional trip delay for each SIP request
            * additional request and response are needed
            * when the responder is a proxy, this is unnecessary overhead
                for a proxy.
            * need the state modification for the originator and the
                responder.


   Q1.1: If A is chosen in Q1, how to embed the responder's identity
           into the response message?

      A: allow the responder's identity to be clearly specified in the
           response header AND the digest is inserted into the header by
           leveraging "Identity" defined before.

      B: allow the responder's identity to be clearly specified in the
           response header AND use AIB for carrying the responder
           identity and related digest.
     =20

      Analysis:
         For A, pros:
            * simple, quite straightforward
            * easy for proxies to check the responders identity
           Cons:
            * anonymity is impossible
            * adds yet another header that has conflicting data
              about identity

         For B, pros:
            * anonymity is possible
           Cons:
            * need to insert AIB into the message
            * anonymity may need end-to-middle support for some proxies.

         Note: Anonymity is described here with respect to A and B.
               For A, any node involved in the SIP dialog can reveal
               the responder identity by looking into the response
               header.

               For B, the responder identity can be hidden into the
               encrypted AIB into the message body. Only the desired
               node(s) with the corresponding key(s) can reveal the
               responder identity.

2. Q2.1 and Q2.2 are about the response authentication.

       Q2.1: Will TLS be deployed in EVERY single hop for each SIP
            dialog?

       A: Yes
       B: No

      Analysis:

         B is apparently the answer.



    Q2.2: If B is chosen in Q2.1, can TLS be expected to be deployed in
            EVERY single hop for each SIP dialog soon? How soon?

           =20
       A: Yes. Regardless of how soon, the community can wait and hope
            for the best.

       B: No. Response authentication needs to be enhanced inside SIP
            itself, which can be complementary to TLS when some hops
            don't have TLS.

       Analysis:
         For A, pros:
             * uniform approach through TLS
             * keep the burden from SIP

            Cons:
             * as long as one hop doesn't have TLS, the chain of trust
                 is broken
             * big risk of expecting TLS be deployed in EVERY single hop
                 soon (there are always exceptions).
             * the progress of moving to TLS in the past has been slow

=20
          For B, pros:
              * if it can be done faster, well it would be done faster

             Cons:

              * enhancement work for SIP
              * not uniform approach anymore (even though they are
                  complementary to each other)
              * as long as one hop doesn't use the new per-hop response
                  authentication, that hop should use TLS. If not,
                  the chain of trust is broken again.
              * not clear it can be done faster than TLS at every hop
 =20
                  =20
3. Q3 is relatively trivial, but it needs the clarification.

   Q3: If its related policy doesn't forbid it to reveal its identity
       for that dialog, how should the responder decide when it should
       reveal its identity back to the originator?


      A: the responder should reveal its identity as the default
           behavior.

      B: the responder must reveal its identity IF AND ONLY IF
           the request message has the new option tag in =ECRequire:=EE
           inside its header? For example, =ECRequire: responder-id=EE.
           =20
      Analysis:
         For A, pros:
            * responder identity will be available as the default
           cons:
            * may provide unnecessary responder identity in some
                scenarios
         =20
         For B, pros:
            * reduce the unnecessary disclosure of responder identity
           cons:
            * need to add new option tag into =ECRequire=EE in request header

               =20

You first need to base64 decode the content of the field, which will
reveal those parameters in binary format.

The base64 decoded nonce field can be of any lenght upwards from 64
bits. That is because the RAND and AUTN params can be appended with
additional server generated data, basically serving as the "real" nonce
of the authentication challenge.

Never mind the fact that the example nonces are, well, nonsense; this is
a known bug in the spec. It was a copy-paste error on my part at the
late stages of editing the draft, and I didn't bother to double-check
the examples by actually decoding the fields again -- they're not legal
base64 encoding.

I regret that now, since it seems that many times examples are to
implementors much more important than actual text, syntax definitions or
figures of bit fields... :(

Cheers,
Aki

Hi,

To try to further answer Juha's questions, the way that
provider.net<http://provider.net>decides what credentials to send is
exactly the same way this works in HTTP.
Provider.net <http://Provider.net> today determines what domain it is
serving based on the port number (set via SRV).
Provider.net<http://Provider.net>is hosting several TLS domains and
for good providers, each hosted domain
can have separate certs and private keys. Example-A.com does not have acces=
s
to Example-B.com's private key and vice versa.

Another standardized but not yet deployed way to solve this problem is to
use the TLS extended client hello extension to provide the name of the
server. When implemented, this allows the server to provide the certificate
of the expected domain on a single port. This is documented in RFC 3546.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,<br>
<br>
To try to further answer Juha's questions, the way that <a href=3D"http://p=
rovider.net">provider.net</a>
decides what credentials to send is exactly the same way this works in
HTTP.&nbsp; <a href=3D"http://Provider.net">Provider.net</a> today determin=
es what domain it is serving
based on the port number (set via SRV).&nbsp; <a href=3D"http://Provider.ne=
t">Provider.net</a> is hosting
several TLS domains and for good providers, each hosted domain can have
separate certs and private keys. Example-A.com does not have access to
Example-B.com's private key and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Another standardized but not yet deployed way to solve this problem is
to use the TLS extended client hello extension to provide the name of
the server.&nbsp; When implemented, this allows the server to provide
the certificate of the expected domain on a single port.&nbsp; This is
documented in RFC 3546.<br>
<br>

Good catch. This is a bug; it should say user aget B not C.

All of the use cases don't need to appear in section 1. I liked the fact=20

As a general rule, we have not tried to use the BNF to enforce these 
kinds of rules. For example, look at Via header field - branch ID is 
reqired but not if you just read the BNF. The reason is that we have 
always allowed the header parameters to appear in in order. It is 
difficult to write a BNF that indicates that a header field has to 
appear at least once, but the ordering amongst other parameters (new or 
existing) is not specified.

I just submitted a revision to the target-dialog spec. Until it appears, 
you can pick it up at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-target-dialog-02.txt

The changes are:

* More text on the importance of cryptographic identifiers for dialog IDs
in order to prevent attacks

* removed NOTIFY as an example dialog-forming request; while it is
one, its confusing to be listed here since target-dialog isn't used in
NOTIFY

* fixed bug in example where 'user agent C' needed to be 'user agent
B'

* generalized the overview; it was written explicitly with REFER, but
target-dialog is more general purpose

* added IANA registry of header field parameters


There are no open issues. I believe this document is ready to go.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

[JRE] There is an additional advantage that the same mechanism can be=
 used
to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, as might happen if =
a
gateway becomes aware of changes in the other network.

>            Cons:
>             * additional trip delay for each SIP request
[JRE] There needn't been an additional round trip delay for the origi=
nal SIP
request. The original SIP request can still receive a final (2xx) res=
ponse
and is then complete - response identity will occur a short time late=
r (or
earlier, if it is sent after a 1xx response but before the 2xx respon=
se).

[JRE] It is questionable whether response identity is needed for a re=
quest
receiving a non-2xx final response, and hence whether response identi=
ty
needs to be generated by a proxy. In draft-elwell-sip-connected-ident=
ity I
suggest that response identity (or connected identity) is important o=
nly
when a dialog is established. Thus it would never come from a proxy.

[JRE] The question is how to include the responder's identity in the
response header in a way that will be signed by the Identity header. =
It may
need a different header to sign it.

[JRE] An equivalent level of anonymity to that provided by the Identi=
ty
header should be possible.

[JRE] Why would it be conflicting? The To header field is known not t=

It seems to me that In-Reply-To (RFC3261) is very similar to the new 
Target-Dialog header proposed in the draft. Perhaps this would merit some 
discussion (on this list and/or in the draft), in particular:

- syntax is very similar, except that In-Reply-To does not allow parameters
- For In-Reply-To, RFC3261 explicitly states that "This field is not a 
substitute for request authentication"
- Is Target-Dialog to be used also for the use case for In-Reply-To 
mentioned in RFC3261 (return calls)? In that case there is no existing 
dialog, but there are similarities

Regards,

Jeroen

are you saying that each time a provider adds a new domain to its proxy,
the proxy would need to start listening on a new port?  in all proxies
that i know, this would mean restarting the proxy, which is very bad.

looks like the extended client hello that jon pointed to, might be a
better solution.  but as far as i know, it is not yet supported by
openssl library, for example.

but provider needs access to both, which is my original concern.

yes.

all this hassle seems to result from not being able to trust dns.  why
not simply sign the dns records pointing to the proxy after which the
proxy would only need to sign itself?

Issue # 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In rfc3261, Section 10.3 Page 65 'Processing REGISTER Requests',

"The registrar checks whether the request contains the Contact
header field..."

here, what I understood gives the following pseudo-code segment :

if (contact header field is present) {
  if (contact == '*') {
    if ((expires == '0') || (additional contact header field is present)) {
      Send 400 response
    }
    else {
      if (Call-Id != bound-call-id) {
        Remove binding
      }
      else if (Cseq < bound-cseq) {
        ERROR
      }
      else {
        Remove binding
      }
    }
  }
  else {
    /* General processing of contact field and update of binding */
  }
}
else {
  /* Fetching of binding */
}

Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect.

Issue # 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In rfc3261, Section 16.12 Page 117 'Summary of Proxy Route Processing'
"2.  The proxy will inspect the URI in the topmost Route header
       field value.  If it indicates this proxy,..."

My understanding of the purpose of route header field is to specify a 
next proxy server (can be a loose router)
for the SIP Message to the proxy server. I am unable to visualize any 
scenario where the 1st entry
of Router field can point to that of the receiving proxy, because at 
every step it gets removed and the
next value becomes the top most value (next poxy for the next proxy server).

Issue # 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In rfc3261, Section 10.3 Page 62 'Processing REGISTER Requests'
"Each REGISTER message MUST be processed independently of any
other registration or binding changes."

Does this imply that the registrar must not buffer register requests in 
attempt to answer
with 1 OK for several REGISTER messages for the same AOR ?
Ex: If a Registrar receives 2 consecutive REGISTER messages with same 
AOR but different contact fields,
       then should it send a single 200 containing 2 bindings or 2 
distinct OKs for each of the REGISTER messages ?
What exactly are the implications if REGISTER requests are not processed 
independently ?

Issue # 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In rfc3261, Section 10.3 Page 63 'Processing REGISTER Requests'
"If the address-of-record is not valid
for the domain in the Request-URI, the registrar MUST send a
404 (Not Found) response and skip the remaining steps."

What will be the response status code when a REGISTRAR responsible for 
domain
abc.def.com receives a REGISTER message
with :
i.    To field set to user1@abc.xyz.com but Request-URI set to abc.def.com
ii.   To field set to user1@abc.xyz.com and Request-URI set to abc.xyz.com

Any help with these issues will be very much appreciated.

thanks,
Rohan Sen

Orit

=20

Orit I have an issue with the last paragraph in section 4 of the current
draft.

=20

   The "norefersub" tag, when included in the Require header field

   (always in conjunction with the "Refer-Sub" header field set to

   "false"), specifies that the REFER-Recipient MUST process a REFER

   transaction without establishing an implicit subscription.  In this

   case, if the REFER-Recipient either doesn't support the extension or

   is not willing to grant the request, the REFER request MUST be

   rejected by sending "420 Bad Extension" response back to the REFER-

   Issuer.

=20

I have not been following discussions on the draft closely but I assume
that the reason why the Refer-sub header was added to the draft was
because the semantics for the use of Require header are not to require a
particular behavior other than to require that the UAS support the
extension(s) identified by the option tags in order to accept the
request containing the Require header.  The above text from section 4
conflicts with my understanding of the text in RFC 3261 regarding the
use of the Require header and also seems to conflict with the definition
of the Refer-sub header in the draft since it would be quite valid to
send a Refer request with Require norefersub and Refer-sub True. A UAC
may require that the UAS support the extension for later requests on
that dialog without requesting Refer-sub False for that specific Refer
(possibly it may need to use Refer-sub True) for a later Refer request.

I would propose that the text is either deleted or modified to:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: End-to-middle Security in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: K. Ono, S. Tachimoto
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-e2m-sec-01.txt
	Pages		: 26
	Date		: 2005-10-25
	
Some services provided by intermediaries depend on their ability to
   inspect a message body in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   When sensitive information is included in the message body, a SIP
   User Agent (UA) needs to protect it from other intermediaries than
   those that the UA agreed to disclose it to.  This document proposes a
   mechanism for securing information passed between an end user and
   intermediaries using S/MIME.  It also proposes mechanisms for a UA to
   discover intermediaries which need to inspect an S/MIME-secured
   message body, or to receive the message body with data integrity.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-target-dialog-02.txt
	Pages		: 16
	Date		: 2005-10-25
	
This specification defines the Target-Dialog header field for the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the corresponding option tag,
   tdialog.  This header field is used in requests that create SIP
   dialogs.  It indicates to the recipient that the sender is aware of
   an existing dialog with the recipient, either because the sender is
   on the other side of that dialog, or because it has access to the
   dialog identifiers.  The recipient can then authorize the request
   based on this awareness.

Actually, Juha, I think DNSSEC is a very promising direction for =
discovering keys associated with domains, including the keys used by =
sip-identity. For the moment, however, it remains a direction. The =
operational issues associated with deploying DNSSEC are well known, and =
while the situation has certainly gotten a lot better of late, it will =
still be some time before DNSSEC signatures could really become a part =
of the security story for applications like SIP. I don't think it would =
be a worthwhile exercise to try to build DNSSEC-like solutions for =
signing/providing keys for SIP as a work-around.

So, while I think it would be worth revisiting the use of DNSSEC for =
sip-identity when it becomes widely deployable, for the moment I think =
we would be best served to stay our current course.

Andrew,
I agree with your point and suggest to fix this statement in the 48
editor's hours, unless the chairs think differently.

=09
=09

	Orit

	=20

	Orit I have an issue with the last paragraph in section 4 of the
current draft.

	=20

	   The "norefersub" tag, when included in the Require header
field

	   (always in conjunction with the "Refer-Sub" header field set
to

	   "false"), specifies that the REFER-Recipient MUST process a
REFER

	   transaction without establishing an implicit subscription.
In this

	   case, if the REFER-Recipient either doesn't support the
extension or

	   is not willing to grant the request, the REFER request MUST
be

	   rejected by sending "420 Bad Extension" response back to the
REFER-

	   Issuer.

	=20

	I have not been following discussions on the draft closely but I
assume that the reason why the Refer-sub header was added to the draft
was because the semantics for the use of Require header are not to
require a particular behavior other than to require that the UAS support
the extension(s) identified by the option tags in order to accept the
request containing the Require header.  The above text from section 4
conflicts with my understanding of the text in RFC 3261 regarding the
use of the Require header and also seems to conflict with the definition
of the Refer-sub header in the draft since it would be quite valid to
send a Refer request with Require norefersub and Refer-sub True. A UAC
may require that the UAS support the extension for later requests on
that dialog without requesting Refer-sub False for that specific Refer
(possibly it may need to use Refer-sub True) for a later Refer request.

	=20

	I would propose that the text is either deleted or modified to:

	=20

	   The "norefersub" tag, when included in the Require header
field,=20

	   specifies that the REFER-Recipient MUST support the extension
or

	   the REFER request MUST be rejected by sending "420 Bad
Extension"=20

	   response back to the REFER-Issuer.

I hadnt considered any relationship with In-Reply-To, this is an 
interesting question. In-Reply-To has seen little to no usage to date, 
AFAIK. Its original intent was quite literally for calling someone back 
later. So, if A calls B, B will have a call log that records it. When B 
calls A back, A will know that this is a call back. Presumably the UA 
would alert the user that this was a callback from a specific call made 
earlier, so the user could decide to accept or reject.

As such, I do not think that the In-Reply-To is a substitiute or 
appropriate vehicle for what we want to do with target-dialog. THe 
reasons are:

1. In-Reply-To references a past call originated by the recipient of 
In-Reply-To. Target-Dialog references a current dialog, and the 
direction of initiation is not relevant

2. In-Reply-To has just a call-id. We need an entire dialog ID.

3. In-Reply-To is meant for human consumption, Target-Dialog, for an 
automata.

4. In-Reply-To implies cause and effect; i.e., this new request is 
BECAUSE of the request you sent me with this call-id. There is no cause 
and effect here, merely a reference for authorization purposes


So, though close, they're not the same. I'm not sure how important this 
is in the draft, since its more of a question of design choice and/or 
relationship with other similar headers. Nice FYI, but won't impact interop.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Jonathan,

I agree with your assesment. Syntax-wise Target-Dialog is a superset of 
In-Reply-To, so I was thinking more in terms of Target-Dialog making 
In-Reply-To obsolete (and not in terms of substituting TD with IRT). In 
particular because I think the In-Reply-To use case (call back) could use 
the authorization which TD provides (and matching on the entire dialog-id 
instead of only the call-id IRT provides). Issue is then that there is no 
'current' dialog in that case.

However, your answer does clarify (for me at least) the design intentions of 
TD, perhaps including some of this information in the draft helps 
understandability

More responses inline

Thanks,

Jeroen

How strong is this "current dialog" requirement? Section 4 currently states 
that when no match is found (i.e. no current dialog), the header MUST be 
ignored.

For both example use-cases mentioned (application interaction and dialog 
tracking), it seems that in case of no match the purpose of the request is 
lost. I can see value in specifying that either:
1) When no match is found, the request containing the TD header MUST be 
replied to with an error response (e.g. 481 Dialog does not exist)
2) OR the sender can include a parameter / flag indicating its preference in 
case of no-match (to allow for valid use cases with no current dialog)

I think in particular for the application interaction example this would 
improve the user experience (e.g. when a URL to an interface is sent, and 
that interface is no longer relevant when the call has ended). This is 
related to the TD header but does go beyond the intended purpose of 
authorization

I would think that both are for automata, a user agent could use the IRT 
call-id as index into its call-log and bring up more details on the call 
(e.g. "You called this party on this and that date/time, there was no 
answer")

5. There can be multiple In-Reply-To headers in a request (although that has 
probably seen even less usage than the single header case)

I was triggered by the syntactic similarity, and then started wondering 
about functional overlap. Based on this information I now believe that they 
are disjunct in purpose; the only point left is whether there are use cases 
(like call back) where authorization is desirable too, although there is no 
"current" dialog. Is the "current" aspect nescessary or perhaps too 
restrictive, and should TD applicability be extended to work for non-current 
dialogs too?

Hi All,

I would like to know the significance if the watcher info in Event Header o=
f
Subscribe.

what would be the difference between Normal Subscribe with Event: Presence
and with Event:Presence.winfo

I have gone thru RFC 3857 it was some what clear.

could anyone give more feedback on this..

Any Comments is appericated.

Hi,

What should be the UA behaviour on receiving two INVITE with different 
from tags, all other headers are same,
should it treat it as different call since it will create a different 
dialog?

Hi,

It is OK from the protocol`s point of view, but I don`t see the application meaning for such INVITEs.

You old-timers might remember that we originally working-group last  
called GRUU during the summer of 2004.

It's changed since then, just a bit. But I think we're getting pretty  
close to "done", so I'd like to have a final round of review here  
before we ship this puppy off to the IESG.

Please re-read the draft and post any comments here and to the author  
(jdrosen@cisco.com).

I plan to conclude this review during the week of November 6, 2005,  
so make sure you get your comments on the list BEFORE November 6.



Now, here's a tidbit of news: The GRUU draft is our first to  
participate in the RFC Editor's "early copy" experiment. The RFC  
editor has already had a crack at the document and suggested some  
changes to the author. Hopefully this will lead to faster passage  
through the RFC Editor queue once the draft has passed IETF Last Call  
and IESG Review.

Orit and I discussed this, and we agree some clarification is in- 
order. I've asked orit to propose some text in RFC-ED before-after  
format, which we'll propose to include with the request for last call.

I'd like to go ahead and start WGLC for the connection reuse draft.  
This is on the proposed SIP re-charter with a November deliverable,  
so we need to get moving on it.

Let's start by putting Brett's three questions "on the plate" and  
noting that WGLC isn't over until they're resolved.


See:

http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg12069.html
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg12077.html
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg12106.html

I'd like to conclude this WGLC no later than November 18, 2005.

As always, please copy your comments to the list and to the author,  
rohan@ekabal.com

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: C. Jennings, R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-outbound-01.txt
	Pages		: 28
	Date		: 2005-10-26
	
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate
   TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in
   order to deliver requests.  However, many practical considerations,
   such as the existence of firewalls and NATs, prevent servers from
   connecting to User Agents in this way.  Even when a proxy server can
   open a TCP connection to a User Agent, most User Agents lack a
   certificate suitable to act as a TLS server.  This specification
   defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars and proxy servers that
   allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by
   the User Agent.  It also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep
   NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections for
   high availability systems.

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

	Title		: Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

The existing security mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol
   are inadequate for cryptographically assuring the identity of the end
   users that originate SIP requests, especially in an interdomain
   context.  This document defines a mechanism for securely identifying
   originators of SIP messages.  It does so by defining two new SIP
   header fields, Identity, for conveying a signature used for
   validating the identity, and Identity-Info, for conveying a reference
   to the certificate of the signer.

Ok, here's my first pass at an agenda for SIP. If you have  
suggestions, please make them.

There's a pretty HTML version at:

Agenda, SIP at IETF 64

Note: For this agenda, the proposed scheduling is NOT strongly in  
order of priority to the working group or milestone dates. Rather,  
topics that require security advisor participation are grouped into  
the first session, as the second session conflicts with the Security  
general area meeting.

I've been thinking about this, and working on some client specs, and  
I'm beginning to think that maybe the Alert-Info header might offer a  
better way to do this, as well as do a number of other things  
(including possibly the alert-mode function of the draft in  
question). Maybe somebody already suggested this, and it just now  
percolated through my brain, so I apologize if I'm failing to credit  
this idea correctly.

The problem with Alert-Info is that it's almost completely  
unspecified. As I read it, 3261 says it takes a URL as a value,  
without providing any way to negotiate (or confirm) the range of URLs  
that might be meaningful to the UAS. Not good.

Some implementations (aka Cisco) use totally bogus integers or  
cadence-maps or other stuff in the Alert-Info header.  Also not good.

What if we were to define a series of URNs that refer to standardized  
alert-behaviors? We could have registered URNS for:

1) Normal alert
2) Distinctive alert (possibly indexed by an integer, for different  
distinctive alerts)
3) Null alert (which provides for the alert-mode behavior from this  
draft)
4) One or more types of request-encoded alerts, like the Cisco  
integers, where the encoded value is carried as a URN parameter set
5) Emergency alert

We could lump these into one URN set (namespace?) and associate a SIP  
OPTION tag with support for the entire set of alerting behaviors. I  
think of this as "basic alerting options", and we could bound up the  
whole set in one I-D.

Thus, an INVITE request might carry something like:

Alert-Info: urn:org.ietf.sip.alert.basic//emergency
Require: alert.basic

or maybe:

Alert-Info: urn:org.ietf.sip.alert.basic//distinct.1

or

Alert-Info: urn:org.ietf.sip.alert.basic//cadence?3,1,3,5


Then for "downloaded" alert sets (aka HTTP or other URLS) we could  
potentially have additional URN sets, perhaps by URL type, or by  
payload type, or some other combination. This could provide subject  
material for additional IDs.

At IETF 63 we said we expected to be able to WGLC the next draft  
(which has been published).

Kumiko tells me that there are currently no open issues to discuss at  
IETF 64.

The current draft passes idnits and looks superficially good to me.


Are we ready to WGLC this draft?

What do we think about requesting some security-area review in  
conjunction with WGLC?

Yes the calls should be treated as different .Since
dialog ID consists of to tag, from tag & call ID. 
if one of them is different, new dialog is created

I agree wholeheartedly with Dean. A URL is a nice, generic way to specify
an alert signal, but unless you know what sort of URLs your client
understands, it's not very useful. Some clients might understand a URL that
returns an audio file, but for other clients that might be totally useless.
A set of standardized URNs that includes the various alerting patterns
typically used in traditional telephony applications would be of great
interest to me and my work. This would include the standard North American
alerting patterns generically identified by the integers one through five,
perhaps expressed more generically in some manner. And I imagine that there
are other forms of alerting that could be accepted as standard. In my
current work, we have had to invent a notation for this, and I've been
suggesting that we think about promoting a standard of some sort.

I've been thinking about this, and working on some client specs, and
I'm beginning to think that maybe the Alert-Info header might offer a
better way to do this, as well as do a number of other things
(including possibly the alert-mode function of the draft in
question). Maybe somebody already suggested this, and it just now
percolated through my brain, so I apologize if I'm failing to credit
this idea correctly.

The problem with Alert-Info is that it's almost completely
unspecified. As I read it, 3261 says it takes a URL as a value,
without providing any way to negotiate (or confirm) the range of URLs
that might be meaningful to the UAS. Not good.

Some implementations (aka Cisco) use totally bogus integers or
cadence-maps or other stuff in the Alert-Info header.  Also not good.

What if we were to define a series of URNs that refer to standardized
alert-behaviors? We could have registered URNS for:

1) Normal alert
2) Distinctive alert (possibly indexed by an integer, for different
distinctive alerts)
3) Null alert (which provides for the alert-mode behavior from this
draft)
4) One or more types of request-encoded alerts, like the Cisco
integers, where the encoded value is carried as a URN parameter set
5) Emergency alert

We could lump these into one URN set (namespace?) and associate a SIP
OPTION tag with support for the entire set of alerting behaviors. I
think of this as "basic alerting options", and we could bound up the
whole set in one I-D.

Thus, an INVITE request might carry something like:

Alert-Info: urn:org.ietf.sip.alert.basic//emergency
Require: alert.basic

or maybe:

Alert-Info: urn:org.ietf.sip.alert.basic//distinct.1

or

Alert-Info: urn:org.ietf.sip.alert.basic//cadence?3,1,3,5


Then for "downloaded" alert sets (aka HTTP or other URLS) we could
potentially have additional URN sets, perhaps by URL type, or by
payload type, or some other combination. This could provide subject
material for additional IDs.

I think I may have mentioned this somewhere, sometime. At least I have 
also been thinking about it, and talking about it in fora where you 
weren't present.

The lack of negotiation capability is somewhat of a problem, though the 
ability to negotiate any behavior of the callee at this stage of the 
call is dubious. (Potentially a UAS could return an error for an 
unrecognized Alert-Info, but that would then yield a HERFP problem.)

I think URNs have a place here.

In general, alerting is normally considered to ultimately be up to the 
one doing the alerting. In most cases I would expect any indication by 
the caller to be advisory. E.g. the callee may not trust the caller, 
and/or may want to use some kind of distinctive alerting it chooses to 
indicate who is calling. Ultimately, both the caller and the callee may 
want to choose, and somebody has to win.

The question then is: if the OPTION tag is there, should the request be 
rejected if the Alert-Info value isn't understood, or if it won't be 
honored?

This is further complicated because I think there will be many cases 
where intermediaries may want to insert an Alert-Info. For instance, I 
know of one proposal for a proxy acting on behalf of the callee to 
implement distinctive alerting by inserting an Alert-Info header with a 
value chosen according to who the caller is. Then the UAS only has to 
honor the Alert-Info, not figure out the circumstances when distinctive 
alerting should apply. I guess the usage for PoC would be simiar to 
this. In some sense things are simpler if the Alert-Info is inserted by 
an agent operating on behalf of the UAS, because it can perhaps be 
assumed to know what the UAS is capable of processing.

I could pick at the details above, but now is not the time. Lets get the 
basic concepts worked out first.

I'm worried about conflicts between the desires of the caller and 
callee, and also about the HERFP problem if we use Require. I think 
these can be sidestepped IF we assume the caller never inserts mandatory 
Alert-Info headers, and that A-I is generally only inserted by an agent 
of the callee that can have been provisioned to be aware of the UAS 
capabilities.

I think it would be good if there was a set of URNs that are defined 
*semantically* rather than defining precisely what should be rendered. 
These would be of much broader applicability than those that specify 
particular audio waveforms, etc., because they could be rendered in a 
variety of ways: audio, video, tactile, in different languages, etc.

However there is probably value in having ones that have specific 
renderings as well.

There could also be scenarios where one entity (e.g. representing the 
caller) inserts a URN that is semantic in nature, and another entity 
(e.g. representing the callee) replaces that with a different URN (or 
URI) that identifies a specific rendering that is consistent with the 
intended semantic, the capabilities of the UAS, and the desires of the 
UAS in terms of culturally specific values.

Agreed.

Defining URNs "semantically" is what I had in mind. In an application
carried over from the PSTN, distinctive alerting takes one of two different
forms, depending upon whether it is rendered as power ringing or as a
call-waiting alert tone. I would want to use a single URN, which the UAS
would render in whatever way is appropriate for the current state of the
device. Other semantic forms are surely useful as well.

I can also see the potential value in having a URN that carries a specific
rendering.

I think it would be good if there was a set of URNs that are defined
*semantically* rather than defining precisely what should be rendered.
These would be of much broader applicability than those that specify
particular audio waveforms, etc., because they could be rendered in a
variety of ways: audio, video, tactile, in different languages, etc.

However there is probably value in having ones that have specific
renderings as well.

There could also be scenarios where one entity (e.g. representing the
caller) inserts a URN that is semantic in nature, and another entity
(e.g. representing the callee) replaces that with a different URN (or
URI) that identifies a specific rendering that is consistent with the
intended semantic, the capabilities of the UAS, and the desires of the
UAS in terms of culturally specific values.

Gents, pardon my ignorance if I say something really stupid

Shouldn't 'semantic URNs' in some manner, shape or form include the format
of alert (i.e. wav, mp3 etc), and the preferred medium of download (i.e.
HTTP, WAP etc)? (because not all UACs will have the capability to support
all forms of alert tones and download mechanisms.

I think it would be good if there was a set of URNs that are defined
*semantically* rather than defining precisely what should be rendered.
These would be of much broader applicability than those that specify
particular audio waveforms, etc., because they could be rendered in a
variety of ways: audio, video, tactile, in different languages, etc.

However there is probably value in having ones that have specific renderings
as well.

There could also be scenarios where one entity (e.g. representing the
caller) inserts a URN that is semantic in nature, and another entity (e.g.
representing the callee) replaces that with a different URN (or
URI) that identifies a specific rendering that is consistent with the
intended semantic, the capabilities of the UAS, and the desires of the UAS
in terms of culturally specific values.

Hi Jon!

And what is the practical solution for in-dialog requests and reponses 
which establish a new TLS connection (e.g. the initial TLS connection 
was terminated)? All SIP proxies I know put IP addresses into the Via 
and Record-Route headers. Thus, the proxy would also need a certificate 
with its IP address?

In my mind, a *semantic* URN representing an alert would be something like:
- normal alert
- emergency alert
- distintive alert N

Then the receiving device would have complete freedom to render whatever 
it thinks is suitable to achieve that semantic. Most likely devices 
would be provisionable with a suitable value.

There is no implication that the alert would be audio. It might be 
rendered using a "ringer" on a phone with traditional form factor, by 
playing a tune on a device with a speaker, by a flashing light on a 
device for a deaf user, and by a popup window on the screen of a PC 
running a softphone with audio disabled. Or it could be a combination of 
things.

What you are describing isn't a URN at all, it is a URL that can be used 
to locate some representation to be rendered. That is ok too, but it 
isn't the same thing.

In case you didn't notice, the ABNF spec has been revised. We should  
now reference RFC 4234 instead of 2234.

So if I try to send anything to the IESG that still references RFC  
2234, somebody please stop me.

SIP is actually very clear here -- accepting the request with a  
Requires: option tag says only that you understand the extension, not  
that you are committing to doing what it says for this call.

Actually, I think that makes it not more complicated, but less. You  
act on the Alert-Info only to the extent that you trust the sender  
and forwarding elements to use it correctly -- kind of like not  
retrieving HTML links inside an unauthenticated email.  I think this  
can be wrapped up with some tight security considerations.

In an IMS-type environment, it would be reasonable to require the S- 
CSCF to strip off any foreign Alert-Info that it doesn't have reason  
to include. We can't say that in IETF, however, as we might well not  
have an S-CSCF.

Well, there's no way to tell WHO inserted an Alert-Info, is there?

So, what happens if we have an Alert-Info extension set, with a  
corresponding Require? If the proxy forks it (I LOATHE forking),  
there's a chance that the request might be delivered to a node that  
doesn't grok the extension, and the resulting 4xx response might be  
HERFP-eaten by the proxy if it gets a "better" response from some  
other branch.

So what?

Either a "better" response goes back to the UAC (perhaps from a  
branch that understands the require),  or it doesn't. Big loss. All  
that happens is that we don't get an error response back from a node  
we didn't want to talk to anyhow.

We could certainly insert caveats about Require and HERFP in the  
draft. Oddly enough, the answer-mode/alert-mode draft I did for OMA  
suffers from exactly the same quirk, but nobody complained there.

We started WGLC on this draft last July, and it's been revved since  
in response to the comments in WGLC.

Everybody happy with it now?

I've posted a revised agenda at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf64/agenda.html

It's basically what we started with, with the exception that Kumiko's  
topic changed (since e2m is "done", but we still have worries about  
SPIT) and Jonathan says there's no need to talk about GRUU or target- 
dialog.

Is there any group working on unification of the wireless technologies? 
My concern is about having a device that supports CDMA GSM WIFI-VOIP and
similar wireless technology those allow to have some standard that allows
roaming between these technologies.

I quite like the idea of a "semantic" URN, and certainly if provided by the
caller anything more than a "semantic" indication would be inappropriate
(you probably don't want UK alert patterns when I call you). I would be
curious to know more about the sort of values that a "semantic" URN would
take. From your list above I can see that "emergency alert" might be useful,
and "normal alert" for all non-special cases. But "distinctive alert N" does
not really convey any semantics.

Hi Digambar Rasal,

I am not aware of any standards for all CDMA, GSM,WIFI-VOIP.

For roaming in GSM and CDMA Networks with out changing the Existing
GSM/IS-41 standards,
Please refer GSM ANSI-41 Interoperability Team (GAIT) Standards.

HTH,

Hi all
I have a  query .In RFC 3398 i.e. SIP-T=20

It is RECOMMENDED that gateways implement functional equivalence with

the call flows detailed in Section 7.1 and Section 8.1. Deviations

from these flows are permissible in support of national ISUP

variants, or any of the conservative policies recommended in Section

15.

=20

=20

i.e. the scenario of getting ACM for every IAM triggered by INVITE.I
feel it is Mandatory.

Can any one tell that why it is quoted as RECOMMENDED instead of
MANDATORY.

regards
Vijay

A couple of nits on the -06 version:

[Section 4]
>    When Bob's domain receives the request, it verifies the signature
>    provided in the Identity header, and thus can validates that the
>    domain indicated by the host portion of the AoR in the From header
>    field authenticated the user, and permitted them to assert that From
>    header field value.  This same validation operation may be performed
>    by Bob's UAS.

"validates" on line 2 should be "validate".

[Section 9]
>    This document specifies two new SIP headers: Identity and Identity-
>    Info.  Each of these headers can appear only once in a SIP message.
>    The grammar for these two headers is (following the ABNF [6] in s):
>    (following the ABNF [6] in RFC3261 [1]):

Remove the entire first parenthesis.

[Section 13.3]
>       Without TLS, the various header field values and the body of the
>       request will not have integrity protection with the request
>       arrives at an authentication service.  Accordingly, a prior
>       legitimate or illegitimate intermediary could modify the message
>       arbitrarily.

"with" on line 2 should be "when" (as it actually was in -05).

[Section 13.4]
>    A verifier MUST evaluate the correspondence between the user's
>    identity and the signing certificate by following the procedures
>    defined in RFC 2818 [11] Section 3.1.  While RFC2818 deals with the
>    use of HTTP in TLS, the procedures described are applicable to
>    verifying identity if one subtitutes the "hostname of the server" in
>    HTTP for the domain portion of the user's identity in the From header
>    field of a SIP request with an Identity header.

"subtitutes" should be "substitutes".

[Appendix D]
>    Changes from draft-ietf-sip-identity-06:

This *is* -06.

Also, a general note. The draft is very inconsistent about whether
references should be written "RFCxxxx" or "RFC xxxx". Please decide on
one format.

Yes, that was what I was thinking too. Which means that the option isn't 
good enough to ensure your chosen alert is rendered. But maybe it is 
good enough to know "it could have done it if it wanted to".

Yes, things are simpler if we imagine this is the kind of environment 
when this feature is typically used.

I don't loathe it the way you do. It presents some problems, but that is 
why they pay us the big bucks - to cope with the problems. :-)

The problem is that there could be two UAs, one of which understands the 
A-I and another that doesn't. The one that supports the A-I isn't going 
to answer, because nobody is manning it. The one that doesn't support 
the A-I is ready and willing to answer.

The caller wants to use the A-I, but will fall back to not using it if 
necessary.

So the call is tried, and the UA that supports the A-I alerts for awhile 
using the chosen alert, but never answers. Eventually the caller gives 
up, and tries without the A-I. Now both UAs alert and the call is answered.

Of course the answer here is to not put the Required header if you don't 
really require the feature. That is a reasonable in this scenario. I 
wonder if there are any scenarios where the Require is helpful?

Probably because it applies in a narrow context. But I would have to go 
back and look at it again.

I didn't put a lot of thought into that list. It is worth discussion.

What I had in mind are things that have semantics corresponding to 
"features", such as the Telcordia ones, or the similar ones being worked 
on for TISPAN. Any feature that causes alerting could have a 
corresponding "semantic URN".

"distinctive alert N" could perhaps have a better name, but I had in 
mind alignment with the traditional distinctive alerting feature. The 
idea would be that some agent working for the callee classifies incoming 
calls into one of several buckets, where each bucket is intended to 
receive a different kind of alerting. But the particular alert 
corresponding to each is left up to independent device provisioning. 
This just gives some "extra" names for buckets that don't have widely 
understood semantic intent - where the semantics are determined by 
someone doing provisioning for an individual AOR, who is not in a 
position to define new URN values.

In some environments this would not be needed. When configuring such an 
agent for the callee, one might instead assign to the bucket an A-I URN 
or URL that identifies a specific rendering. Which to do depends on the 
capabilities of the system and the UAs.

Some unification of GSM and WIFI Voice is being addressed in 3GPP, in the
GERAN working group, under the name GAN (Generic Access Network).  It was
formerly called UMA (Unlicensed Mobile Access).

Is there any group working on unification of the wireless technologies?
My concern is about having a device that supports CDMA GSM WIFI-VOIP and
similar wireless technology those allow to have some standard that allows
roaming between these technologies.

Thanks for the notes.

A note to everyone - this document has been revised ONLY to
handle the final IESG review.  It is not open for discussion
because it will get one last re-review check and then go
to the RFC Editor queue.

Thanks

Recently I noticed the implementation of TR/87 spec in several SIP
Application Servers. My question (sorry it is out off topic for these
lists) is about if it is a right use of SIP according to the
architectural design principles of SIP and particulary, the use of
INVITE for establish a signalling session. I mean: is SIP the right
choice to transport another signalling protocol as CSTA? If yes, it is
INVITE the right method to transport CSTA information or
SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY would be a better choice? Finally, do we need CSTA
over SIP when we have RFC 4117 for 3PCC?

I actually do know of a situation where you would setup a call with no
media: KPML.

Let's say you want to establish a signaling-only session for
transporting digits only.

So you want to set up a session that has no description? Why would you=20
want to do that?

That seems *so* wrong! The whole point of INVITE is to negotiate the=20
details of the session.

Yes, you could use something else besides SDP - the obvious candidate is

SDPng. But using none doesn't seem to fit the intent of INVITE.

You can get much the effect you seem to be seeking simply by using SDP=20
that has no m=3D lines.

Exactly. If you don't actually require that the end point support the  
extension, don't insert a Require header for it. You can still offer  
the feature, and if it gets used, that's nice.

If we use an Alert-Info header for the "don't bother the user because  
this is just an administrative loopback test call" function allowed  
for in draft-willis-answeralert, we get some mileage out of having a  
Require. Because we REALLY DON'T want the phone to ring and get  
picked up, resulting in a very confused user. We WANT the call to  
fail if the client doesn't support the extension. There are probably  
other cases, but as with most SIP extensions, sending a Require is  
generally the exception, not the rule.

Well, please go have another look at that draft, because they're  
about to start gestating cattle over in OMA for the lack of a  
solution to this problem.

Not at all. You could always fail the transaction.  There's a  
difference between rejecting a request because you don't understand a  
specific extension and rejecting a request because your policy  
disallows acting on that extension for this specific request -- in  
one case you return a "bad extension" response, and in the other a  
"forbidden" with reason text explaining why it was forbidden ("403 I  
ain't doing preconditions with you, sucker!")

It's like the difference between not supporting digest  
authentication, and not allowing a specific user to place a call.


I suppose it would be fair to say that it is up to the specific  
extension to say one of:

1) If you accept a request but can't/won't honor the extension, the  
transaction proceeds with a potentially diminished or altered user  
experience.
2) If you accept a request but can't/wont honor the extension, then  
an error condition results.


This is one of the differentiators for P-class extensions: they have  
to be in class 1 above.  There are other differentiators, such as  
that P-headers are not allowed to have option tags, and they aren't  
required to be standards-track.


Alert-Info definitely falls into class 1. You might receive an Alert- 
Info with the semantic "distinctive ring associated with your primary  
line service", but have a user-interface that recognizes that the  
call is from your fiance's phone and instead plays Mendelsohn's  
"Wedding March". This doesn't break the protocol. So the same phone  
might receive an Alert-Info with the semantic "Emergency" and instead  
play your configured emergency tone. In both cases your phone  
understands the Alert-Info header and would accept the request even  
with a Require:.

I'd rather not. I think they really have different semantics.

But they are menat for different consumption. Target-Dialog is really 
meant for automata to authorize a request based on security properties. 
In-Reply-To is really for rendering to a human, so they can know that 
this call was a consequence of a previous call attempt (which may have 
never even resulted in a dialog).

I could add some text to clarify; I'd really rather do that in a rev 
that comes out after IETF LC...

Well, as you say, the MUST requirement makes it clear that it is about 
the current dialog.

481 is not appropriate since there isnt yet a dialog. The point of 
ignoring the target-dialog is that you'd proceed as if the originator 
didn't know about the dialog, and let authorization happen by other 
means. In most cases, my assumption is that the request would not be 
authorized, and result in a 403.

I think the UAS has to decide what happens, not be dictated by UAC.

In most cases, the thing that is requested the interaction with the UA 
will know that the dialog has gone away..

True, but its still ultimately to render something. Its a UI hint, no more.

I would rather not. Target-dialog has a pretty specific scope, and 
expanding it to include the functions of In-Reply-To is not something I 
see a need to do.

Wellll, I had hoped we're done, but there is a thread running (so far, 
just me and Jeroen van Bemmel) that does raise an open issue. Unless we 
can resolve on the list, we'll need time on the agenda after all, and we 
can't send to IESG until its resolved.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Am I missing something? If that is all you want to do, then simply send 
a subscription for the KPML event package. You don't need a media-less 
INVITE to do that.

I've posted yet another slightly a revised agenda at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf64/agenda.html

This revision adds (if time permits) a discussion led by David  
Schwarz of SAML for SPIT control at the end of session 1, and a  
discussion of route construction led by Jonathan Rosenberg at the end  
of session 2.

Am I missing something? If that is all you want to do, then simply send=20
a subscription for the KPML event package. You don't need a media-less=20
INVITE to do that.

My 2 cents is ... This is an cutting it a bit too short on the WGLC given
the rest of stuff happening and the importance of this document. It's been
how many years? Anyways, I will be very happy to get this document finished.

I've posted yet another slightly a revised agenda at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf64/agenda.html


This revision deletes the time slot for Feng Cao's response identity  
draft (which is still a useful reference but hasn't been revised  
since the last meeting), and adds a mini-discussion for Rohan's  
remote call control draft (by popular demand).

I don't believe I've ever revised the SIP agenda more than twice  
before a meeting, and this is, I think, the 22nd SIP meeting that  
I've done the agenda for.

  Not that I mind (having a good agenda is Really Important), but I'm  
kind of curious as to why the churn. Perhaps it is related to the  
rechartering effort.

I just learned about the remote call control draft, which appears to be one 
of the first to be using Target-Dialog (its usage was introduced with 
the -02 version of the draft).

Interestingly, the remote-cc-02 draft is not using it for authorization 
purposes (yet) as seems to be the main intention formulated in the 
target-dialog draft. Rather, it states that the Target-Dialog header MUST be 
used "to select the appropriate dialog from which to source the request". I 
would say that - based on the name of the header - this would be one of the 
most obvious usages of the header, but the target-dialog draft does not 
really discuss this aspect.

This leads to some questions:
1) Is the way the remote cc draft is using the Target-Dialog header 
appropriate / desirable ?
2) If yes, should this be documented in the target-dialog draft?

In particular, I think the target-dialog draft should then e.g. discuss 
which error response code is sent back when there is no match on the 
Target-Dialog. A '403 Unauthorised' would not seem appropriate in this case. 
Perhaps a new response code would need to be introduced

Likewise, the remote cc draft could mention the authorization aspects of the 
Target-Dialog header as a security consideration (currently, it recommends 
Digest Authentication)

Regards,

jeroen

Hi Mariano,

I realise that I am treading on dangerous ground here, but I couldn't 
resist answering. 

If you are asking yourself whether SIP is appropriate for carrying another 
"signalling 
protocol" is like asking "can I use SIP to do something for me". Most, if 
not all, 
SIP implementations rely on the fact that some other protocol is being 
carried in a SIP
body. SDP and the XML used for IM and presence are good examples of this. 
The SIP methods
that could be used to convey these protocols, is obviously open for 
discussion, but I
fear that it will be extremely difficult to come to real consensus on 
this. In the CSTA
case, I would say that, depending on what you are doing, both methods 
could be appropriate. 

BTW, Microsoft uses SIP messages with the CSTA XML variant for LCS.

3PCC is not quite as powerful as CSTA. Realise that "CSTA" covers a 
complete suite of 3rd
party call control functionality, whereas 3PCC "just" describes a method 
by which a few
3rd party call control services could be realised. Precisely because of 
3PCC's limitations
TR/87 was created.

Cheers,

Frank

Subject
[Sip] About the ECMA TR/87 (aka SIP CTI Interface)
Classification







Recently I noticed the implementation of TR/87 spec in several SIP
Application Servers. My question (sorry it is out off topic for these
lists) is about if it is a right use of SIP according to the
architectural design principles of SIP and particulary, the use of
INVITE for establish a signalling session. I mean: is SIP the right
choice to transport another signalling protocol as CSTA? If yes, it is
INVITE the right method to transport CSTA information or
SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY would be a better choice? Finally, do we need CSTA
over SIP when we have RFC 4117 for 3PCC?

Regards,

Dean,

While I accept this would be reasonable behaviour for alert-info case, I
still disagree with your statement that "SIP is actually very clear here --
accepting the request with a Requires: option tag says only that you
understand the extension, not that you are committing to doing what it says
for this call."

In section 3 of RFC 3262 it states: "The UAS MUST send any non-100
provisional response reliably if the initial request contained a Require
header field with the option tag 100rel. If the UAS is unwilling to do so,
it MUST reject the initial request with a 420 (Bad Extension) and include an
Unsupported header field containing the option tag 100rel." So in this
particular case you cannot accept the request but not honour the extension.

John

as far as i understand, gan/uma work is not based on ietf sip standards.
it would be a good idea to show how roaming between different network
technologies could be done using sip.  i would assume that the gruu
stuff together with replaces header, for example, would get us
somewhere.   perhaps where already exists call flow examples in some
documents?

This is far off-topic for this list, but both 3GPP and 3GPP2 are
defining mechanisms
for roaming between GSM/WCDMA & WiFi (3GPP) and between CDMA & WiFi
(3GPP2).  There
are some proprietary mechanisms for GSM & CDMA roaming.  My assumption
is that
this is something that needs to be discussed in 3GPP/3GPP2, SIP
shouldn't have
to worry about layer 2 roaming.

Fortunately this has already started. Please see:

as far as i understand, gan/uma work is not based on ietf sip standards.
it would be a good idea to show how roaming between different network
technologies could be done using sip.  i would assume that the gruu
stuff together with replaces header, for example, would get us
somewhere.   perhaps where already exists call flow examples in some
documents?

The use of other protocols like SDP and others in SIP must NOT need to
be generalized by making a technically "wrong" interpretation such as
"carrying of other protocols."

Technically write interpretation of using SDP and others in SIP is this:

1. SDP and other protocols "complement" the session initiation in SIP.
2. SIP must NOT be used just another "transport" protocol for carrying
other protocols.
3. SIP must NOT be used to carry another protocol suits of "session
establishment" protocols that contradict the very fundamentals for which
SIP has been created as a standard.

If anyone violates the above items, definitely, they are abusing SIP
standards, and it must be stopped immediately.

Any comments?

If you are asking yourself whether SIP is appropriate for carrying

[Sip] About the ECMA TR/87 (aka SIP CTI Interface)
Classification







Recently I noticed the implementation of TR/87 spec in several SIP
Application Servers. My question (sorry it is out off topic for these
lists) is about if it is a right use of SIP according to the
architectural design principles of SIP and particulary, the use of
INVITE for establish a signalling session. I mean: is SIP the right
choice to transport another signalling protocol as CSTA? If yes, it is
INVITE the right method to transport CSTA information or
SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY would be a better choice? Finally, do we need CSTA
over SIP when we have RFC 4117 for 3PCC?

Specific extensions can indicate that the request should be failed  
with an error response (and specify he response) although I question  
the wisdom of rejecting a request with a 420 after having indicated  
support for that extension in a Supported header.

But I'm willing to concede that the documentation is unclear, given  
the wording in the example.

Thanks!

Digambar,
When you are referring to "unification," is your question related to the
ability of the core network to authenticate a user and deliver a VoIP
service independent of access technology or the ability for a device
access multiple air interface technologies to support VoIP?

BR,
Bjorn

Subject: [Sip] unification of wireless technologies=20

Is there any group working on unification of the wireless technologies?=20
My concern is about having a device that supports CDMA GSM WIFI-VOIP and
similar wireless technology those allow to have some standard that
allows roaming between these technologies.
