Until sip-privacy removes the 'screen=' parameter, sip-privacy still has
sunny-day handling for the insertion of RPID headers by untrusted UAs. I'm
not suggesting that we add text saying that untrusted UAs MUST NOT add the
RPID. I'm suggesting that the concept of an 'untrusted' RPID be expunged (by
removing the 'screen' concept and the associated protocol apparatus), and
that proxies MUST remove RPIDs they receive from untrusted sources. I think
would be much more effective.

Yes, Flemming did reply to my comments, but I don't think that exchange
necessarily resolved the open issues. Since that time (especially during the
WG meeting in Minneapolis) I've been focusing primarily my efforts on just
the first issue in my mail, the 'screen=' parameter. If we get past this
I'll move on to further issues -  I feel 'screen' has the highest priority.
Suffice it to say that I'm not backing away from any of my other arguments -
I'm just trying to handle one matter at a time.

So, then, you mean that I'm supposed to send an INVITE to the hostname and
port identified in the encrypted URI when I want that URI translated? I had
gotten the impression from the text that I could use the hostname and port
to query for a translation of the encrypted URI to its original form. I
guess I got that impression from the line in 6.1:

   ... whereas the "hostport" 
   identifies the entity that can decrypt the information

But now I can see how this admits of either reading. However, I'm a little
confused about how this is then supplying a valuable privacy service. When I
request privacy for a call, I don't exactly expect that the person I'm
calling will be able to call me back. But 7.2 suggests that encrypting the
URI in this way makes it suitable for transmission to untrusted entities. Is
this the desired behavior? Or does the server decrypting the URI make some
further decision to disallow certain requests to that URI? If so, this
should at least be mentioned.

As a means of malicious call trace (which I assume is the motivating
requirement) this also seem a little counterintuitive, especially if, as the
tracing network, I don't intend to start a session with the entity
identified by the URI. Is there some other request (maybe part of the
'certain call control functions') you mention above that I can send that
will just result in the decrypting of the URI? Or should the tracing network
requests a translation out-of-band somehow?

I must also point out that the other concerns I raised in my previous mail
are quite material to whether or not this is encryption mechanism is
genuinely implementable. There really are a lot of points that would need to
be resolved.

When I read things like this I'm really not sure if you're being serious.
Are you honestly suggesting that it doesn't matter whether or not the
network-verified identity for a request is presented to the UAS and end
user? That it doesn't matter if trusted network elements communicate such
identities to untrusted elements? I'd like to think it is clear from my
wording above that Call-Info is 'optional' in the sense that users can
display it if they like, whereas RPID has strict rules concerning whether or
not a UA is eligible to receive the network-verified identity - this is
unrelated to whether or not the UA can display it. Hence the distinction I
attempted to draw between selectively rendering the content (RPID) and
rendering optional content (Call-Info). There are restrictions on where RPID
is passed that do not currently exist for Call-Info.

You raise a reasonable point on how a malicious call trace would be
triggered.  In the PSTN, one dials a service code and the network does the
rest.  "The rest" consists of a printout of the call trace on a teletype in
a telco office, or the more modern equivalent -- the called party gets no
access to its contents.  Thinking in SIP terms, the called party would
presumably also do an INVITE to a service code and include the encrypted
token which encapsulates the necessary trace information.

It allows for a network-asserted identity provided by network A to be delivered
via network B, even though network B does not trust A.

Yes you have, and you have also said that we must remove any untrusted
Remote-Party-Ids. Well, if there in the future is a signature covering the
Remote-Party-Id (among other things), the end-user can now actually see who is
vouching for the Remote-Party-Id, regardless of whether any intermediary proxies
trust the previous hop and/or verifies the signature. This makes the
Remote-Party-Id more generally usable in the future as well, which seems to be
something you want to prevent.

You are concerned about somebody doing something the draft does not define, and
in fact explicitly states it is not intended for. You have not provided any
technical problems with this, but are only concerned with the potential for
misuse. There is no point in either of us continuing to repeat the same
arguments on this point. If somebody else feels strongly about this point and
has something technical to offer, they should speak up.

Bill already explained how malicious call trace works - you will not be able to
call that party back.

Well the draft doesn't say this (except for From in the anonymous case which I
have already agreed to change to "anonymous@localhost" instead), so this is
completely bogus.

Well, this is big part of the problem. The draft has been in the works for three
years and there has been plenty of opportunity for you to participate and shape
the draft. What is in the privacy-04 draft is the result of the discussions and
consensus that have formed among the active participants in this process.
However, as you admit, you have not been interested in contributing to this
draft but instead chose to ignore it until the very last minute, where you then
show up with a laundry list of items you want changed, and in most cases not
because there is anything technically wrong, but simply because you personally
disagree with them and fear that some people may use them in ways you do not
like. You claim to not be interested in killing the privacy draft, but your
timing could hardly have been more obstructive. I will furthermore also note,
that you have not managed to produce a lot of support for your positions. I
think this goes a long way towards deciding what to do with some of your
comments.

To which I responded, but you didn't follow up (in fact I will note that WG Last
Call for this draft ended before you decided to revive just one of your
objections).

Can it get any more hypocritical than this ? It's OK for a bunch of headers to
be underspecified and open to abuse, but it's not OK for Remote-Party-Id to be
open to abuse, even though there are explicit statements in there saying what it
is *not* intended for and furthermore extensibility is under the control of
designated expert review (all of which were added in an attempt to accommodaty
you and address your concerns, but it is still not good enough for you). I'm
becoming less and less convinced that you are interested in anything but killing
this draft.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Private SIP Extension for Service Route Discovery in 
                          Some Networks
	Author(s)	: D. Willis
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-scvrtdisco-00.txt
	Pages		: 12
	Date		: 28-Mar-02
	
This document proposes a private SIP extension header used in
conjunction with responses to REGISTER messages to provide a
mechanism by which the registrar may inform the UA of a service route
that the UA may use to request outbound services from the registrar's
domain.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Extension for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts
	Author(s)	: D. Willis
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-path-02.txt
	Pages		: 10
	Date		: 28-Mar-02
	
The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate
a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact
is generally in the form of a URI, such as Contact:
&ltsip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and
associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.  The
problem is that network topology may be that there are one or more
SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any message
from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these
proxies.  The REGISTER method itself does not give us a mechanism to
discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for
future use.  This document defines an extension header, 'Path' which
provides such a mechanism.

Hi everybody,
          I am student of SUNY at Stonybrook. I have to
do a project on Formal Verification of a protocol. I
wanted to work on something which has not been done
before. I was searching the net looking for a protocol
for few weeks now. I came across this SIP protocol.
Can you please guide me if anybody has done
Verification/model checking using any
tool(murphy,spin,XML..) on this protocol?
And it will be nice of you if you could guide me about
aspects/properties i can concentrate for verification of this 
protocol. I will
highly appreciate if you could guide this student.



thanks,
Nitin Khosla

Rohan:

I listed this before as well, but once again, the I-D says that the
header can appear in any request or response.  IMHO, it can appear
in any request, but should be limited to some responses.  There was
some email exchange between me, Sean Olson, and Tom Taylor, which
resulted in 155 and 183 being possible responses where the header
adds some value.

One more question, if the Reason header always begins with a response
code, can it appear in a request that initiates a dialog -- since there
is no response to pass through in this case.  This is more of case 5
Gonzalo identified in
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg04410.html
I re-read that again and am not quite sure if Reason is applicable in
instances where a dialog has not been established.  For example, when a
B2BUA invites the second leg of a 2-party call, what Reason header
will it carry in the initial INVITE towards that leg?

Hi all,

Note that in Minneapolis (after some airing of this draft), I received
several strong sugestions to change the proposed header name from "Path"
to "RegisterRecordRoute, short form "RRR". This appears to be related to
thefact that the main thing the draft does is define RecordRoute for
REGISTER operations.

My current plan is to include this change along with any other nits in
the next rev of the draft, and hopefully to proceed to WGLC from there
in time to include this material in the "Bundle 3" IETF last call set.

So please get any comments in ASAP -- I'd like to edit the next rev next
week.

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the
message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-willis-sip-path-02.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-02.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split

The issue Jon talks about is more philisophical than technical, so it is
hard to offer something technical. The problem is, what sort of errors can
occur? If an untrusted RPID is present in a message, then a UA should not
trust it. It is rather unclear to me what useful thing a UA can do with an
RPID _without_ trusting it, other than perhaps displaying it to the user
with some sort of "don't trust this" disclaimer.

Now, that behavior would be similar to today's use of email, where your
email reader reports this message is from me simply due to an untrusted from
header. Unfortunately, less sophisticated users do not understand what it
means when I say that From: is untrusted. They will assume the email is from
me, unless there is some evidence to the contrary. Indeed, they will tend to
doubt me if I were to say that I did _not_ send the email. I bring up email
only as an existance proof that the general public will often screw up when
handed an untrusted identity--and to suggest that we do not repeat that
design mistake.

So, an untrusted RPID allows a mistake on the part of the UA (perhaps doing
some sort of automatic processing) or by the user (by not really
understanding what trust means.) This creates a fail-unsafe condition (that
is, a failure on the part of the UA does damage)

If there were no RPID at all, both of these mistakes are impossible. This
creates a fail-safe situation, where the UA (and user) are unable to hurt
themselves by improperly handling the information.

Now, the only real _advantage_ I can think of keeping untrusted RPID headers
is the situation where one hop cannot verify the identity, but the next hop
can. But if I read the screen token section correctly, a "no" always wins if
there are multiple screen tokens. So, if P(1) says no, and P(2) says yes,
the UA should still treat the value as "no." Is this the intended
interpretation?

That's the hard part about discussing philosophy which is why we really
shouldn't, because we are not all going to agree. I do believe the above is
actually useful, inasmuch as it is better than not getting anything at all.

I would argue the other way and actually see e-mail as an excellent existence
proofs that this is both workable and useful. People that are not content with
that level of security can for example PGP sign their e-mails and get better
security. Similarly, if people are not happy with the screen parameter, they can
define a more comprehensive and general security solution and start applying
that on top. What is the problem here ?

There is no end to what kind of mistakes can be made by a UA. Using this kind of
logic, we should then note that bad things can happen if you blindly trust the
information provided in the From header field, and hence we should make sure
this can't happen by obfuscating the From header field. However, nobody is
seriously arguing this way for good reason.

If you really want to apply that philosophy to the SIP protocol, then we have a
lot of unfinished work ahead of us. It certainly hasn't been a design principle
so far.

That is one advantage. Also, the ability to have a stronger security solution
applied on top is another (and I still think there is value in an untrusted
Remote-Party-Id as opposed to no Remote-Party-Id at all).

Strictly speaking yes, but that part doesn't really apply here (there's only
supposed to be one token). If P(2) can actually authenticate the
Remote-Party-Id, it should set the screen parameter to "yes" (if there is a "no"
parameter, it should be removed).

In the absence of a PKI or only receiving email from parties that you
have a shared key with, would you suggest we remove or don't display the
From header in email? The problem is that it works for 99+% of the cases
without authentication, so removing this capability without a credible
replacement isn't too helpful, even if it makes the purists feel better.

Or if you treat this as yet another indication of what the sender may
be. If I recognize the name, there's a high likelihood that it is
correct, just like From headers in email, but before I send $100,000 to
the account listed at a bank in Nigeria, trust that this is indeed BMW's
Director of North American operations (to cite another semi-public
version of identity fraud) or open that binary attachment, I'd rather
confirm that this is safe. As the latter case shows, the major damage
that identity impersonation does today would not be cured by a trusted
identity at all.

Unless it can be shown that the From header in SIP-bis subsumes all of
the RPID functionality, I fail to see what the harm is of providing
additional information, as long as it is labeled appropriately.

I can see one minor advantage: It does add the equivalent of the
X-Authentication header in email, namely an indication that From and
identity as seen by a proxy doesn't match, which would presumably be a
clue that something might (or might not) be amiss. Yes, it can be faked,
but it makes life a tad harder for SIP spammers using relays.

Some quick questions:


*) Question 1
============
Section 4.1 quotes:
"It has been suggested that the UA MAY choose to store the contents of    the Path header for future use as a preloaded
Route for use when the  UA wishes to send a SIP message that, for reasons of acquiring  services in the home network,
need to transit the service proxies in    the home network.  Such usage is explicitly outside the scope of this
 document."


Section 4.4: Procedures at the Home Proxy

"With the addition of Path, the home service proxy also copies  (inverted) the route set associated with the specific
contact in the  registrar database into the Route header of the outgoing message as a preloaded route.
 This causes the outoing message to transit the set   of proxies that indicated that they were to be used in future
   messages to that contact by including themseleves in the Path header"


ARC> Is it correct to assume that in such a n/w the homeproxy will surely be in the path of all SIP requests originating
from this UA ? If so, then Path orders are already being converted to Route Sets by the outgoing proxy as per above
qoute. So if the UA were to 'pre load' this same route (earlier quote) for whatever reason,
 what would happen when this pre-loaded route arrives at the Home Proxy who will attempt the same operation ?



*) Question 2
============
Also, the path header is being introduced because doing the same in RR is
not backward compatible.
Just wondering: The RR has progressed in such a way that we now have the
old R-R (no pre-loaded routes)
and the new R-R (pre-loaded routes). The current RFC states that
record-routes should be ignored in REGISTERs
and not followed in its 200OK.  To allow this case, cant this wording be
changed in the RFC saying the REGISTRar
may choose to ignore Route sets in REG/OK ? Even as of today, putting RR in
REGISTER wont break impl - it would
be ignored. Anyway backwards compatibility hardly seems to be the concern
specifically with RR looking at how
it has changed over time. So why not relax its usage and avoid another
header that does exactly the same thing ?

I am in favour of not overloading one header to mean a hundred things, but
to me this case looks like it means the same
thing really. Just that now we are saying RR is possible for all requests.
What the entities do with RR in non-dialog
related transactions is upto it.

Yes, you seem to have skipped the question I was building up to... Who is
supposed to be the consumer of the network-asserted identity here, then? You
say above that you want 'screen' for Caller-ID. But in this Iraqi case,
surely if the originating user requested anonymity, no Caller-ID is going to
be displayed (and the From field would be just as good as RPID if anonymity
weren't requested). Since its untrusted, I don't think the RPID could be
used by the network either (for call-trace or billing). So who will be using
the untrusted RPID? I see no reason why the answer isn't 'no one', and that
seems to suggest to me that untrusted RPIDs can be removed at the trust
boundary.

IIRC this is the only example for which you have argued, to date, that
'screen' is necessary. If we can't substantiate a use for 'screen' in this
case, I'm left with the impression that 'screen' is unmotivated.

Well, fair enough - I'm not averse to discussing this point too, but first
discuss the matter at hand: How would the 'screen' parameter help the
end-user if they could just read the signature of messages? What, if
anything, does this argue in favor of keeping 'screen'?

Now on this other matter, I suspect that the introduction of signatures just
does away with the concept of an intrinsically 'untrusted' RPID, since every
element in the network would be empowered to have its own opinion about
whose RPIDs they trust. In that sense, there would no longer be any border
elements that make trust decisions on behalf of the entire federation. I
have in fact been arguing that the concept of an 'untrusted' RPID isn't
useful and that it should go away, so yes, I agree that signatures would be
an improvement in the mechanism. Indeed, if the mechanism supported per-RPID
signatures you and I would probably be one step closer to agreement, but the
devil is in the details with all this signing/encryption stuff.

Hello,

Here is my problem: given a small density gateway that support only up to a
fully channelized T1 interface,
that does not have any pretention to do PSTN routing, however that can be
used to provide PSTN access to 
SIP phones sitting behind it.... How do I register my PSTN interface to my
proxy ?

Can I register a route ?  And if so how ?  Can I just tell my proxy to
forward to the gateway any E.164 address 
that it cannot resolve by itself ?  I do not find anything in SIP that could
allow me to do something like this...  
Unless I am missing something here...

Thanks,

Pierre

From a purely theoretical point of view, the
question, "can I form a NOTIFY such that an
appropriately configured forking proxy will
be induced to fork it," the answer is "yes."
And, if you do so, you get what you deserve.

I contend that any network in which a NOTIFY
*does* fork has at least one misbehaving node.

More to the point: any mechanism that creates a
subscription without using SIP signalling is
completely responsible to make sure that the NOTIFY
requests are sent to one, and exactly one, subscriber.
I strongly suspect that any event package that
does not adequately address this issue will be laughed
out of the room if presented to any SIP-related
working group (as, indeed, it must for IANA
registration of a package name).

Look over the loose-routing stuff in the most recent
SIP spec if you intend to implement such a mechanism.
Note that this is not a trivial problem to solve, which
is why the sip-events document does not attempt to
specify how to address it.

Certainly, but call trace may still work. Just becuase the information was
untrusted does not mean it is false. If the Iraqi phone company keeps sending us
false information, we can always put appropriate procedures in place to deal
with that.

Not if you want network asserted identity information which is what
Remote-Party-Id gives you.

It is correct that Remote-Party-Id does not provide for non-repudiation, but if
you really want that, you have a hard problem on your hand. Present day
telephony and data service provide trace solutions without any resemblance of
such guarantees and I suspect they will continue that way for a while.

As I have explained many times already, untrusted does not equal useless in my
philosophy book. Furthermore, if you remove it, you can't provide a more secure
solution (read: crypto signature) in the future for this mechanism without
having everybody being able to verify such signatures. Any intermediary not able
to do that will will impose it's ugly policy on you and remove it even though
the signature could perhaps be verified by somebody else.

If you don't have screen, you need to specify that you remove
unverified/untrusted Remote-Party-Id. If you remove untrusted Remote-Party-Id,
you require all intermediaries to be able to either trust or verify a given
Remote-Party-Id. If you have a signature on a Remote-Party-Id, you don't want to
remove an untrusted Remote-Party-Id since a downstream entity can verify the
signature to determine authenticity.

If you had paid any attention to previous (and even fairly recent) discussions
about this draft, you would know that it used to have a signature mechanism, but
it was noted that it was a special case of a general security problem. General
problems should have general solutions, and hence we are waiting for the
security gurus to come up with that general security solution which could, among
other things, sign Remote-Party-Ids. This consensus has been formed long time
ago and was repeated recently.

The problem is that untrusted From headers in email has led to a general
population of users that believe they _can_ trust the from header.

I assume you are referring to the explosion of email worms? I think that is

The problem here is that email clients _don't_ make it clear that you cannot
trust the from information. You seem to think the general populace of email
users understand that they cannot trust the identity for unsigned messages,
or even understand what it means to trust or not trust an identity. Maybe
people just don't care--PGP must not have been a big seller to die off as a
commercial product. Or more likely they just don't understand. The point is,
if you provide untrusted information here, people will trust it anyway.

"We should stop repeating a mistake" and "We should go back and fix every

Are you thinking that someday the RPID might have some sort of signature
that could be verified by the UA, but not by a proxy? Well, when we have
such I would be perfectly happy to have the proxy send on an RPID it cannot
verify, as long as the proxy can see that it contains something that might
be verifiable by the client. (In general, that is the same as the multihop
scenario below, I think.)

On a re-read of the proxy behavior section, I can see how that is the case.
I suggest if this behavior stays in spec, that the proxy behavior wording be
tightened a little bit. Someone not privy to these conversations might not
interpret the statement that there must be no more than one screen token to
mean the same as "the proxy must remove all previous screen tokens."

This seems to be a user interface problem as much as a protocol problem.
Even regular users seem to have learned to distinguish the open/closed
lock icon on web browsers indicating trust levels. Since there doesn't
seem to be a viable alternative in the foreseeable future, given ample
opportunity in the email space to develop one, I don't see how this
discussion is particularly helpful.

> I assume you are referring to the explosion of email worms? I think that is
> another problem entirely and only tangentally related to the discussion.

I was trying to highlight three different aspects of
(mis)identification:

1) In some cases, even a certified identity doesn't help any. The
various Outlook attachments are an example where being 100% sure that
you sent the email is probably harmful as it may lead me to trust the
attachment more than I should.

2) See http://slate.msn.com/?id=2063114 for a recent "interesting" case
of email spoofing. In that case, the name of the author probably was
less important than his (faked) corporate affiliation. In that case, a
user agent that detected a set of incongruous routing headers and
flashed a warning probably would have been more helpful.

3) For most people, impersonation is not a major problem, as far as I
can tell. I don't get spam from known people (yet) and I doubt that most
of the email scams rely on impersonation. Having a certified identity
for shady.character@coldmail.com isn't particularly helpful.

Unlike email, with SIP it should be relatively easy to check whether an
address is valid in real time. (Indeed, having an identity that can be
verified if reachable, but is not callable, could be a useful service.)
True impersonation is also fairly hard to scale to the levels needed to
make spam work, as the spammer has to have access to my address book or
impersonate some well-known person. Most people would be suspicious if
they got email from Britney Spears.

Given the lack of real incentives for most people, I doubt that
certified identity is high on people's list of things to spend money on.
Certificates would have to be easily trusted (small number of global
CAs) and easily movable (as otherwise most calls from hotel and
payphones would remain unauthenticated).

Thus, I find it somewhat unfair and not particularly helpful to make
principled objections on "holier-than-email" grounds, particularly
absent a credible proposal that addresses these issues and has any real
chance of being deployable in years measured in single digits.

I would hope that RPID is going to be the exception, as S/MIME-signed
messages might offer a reasonable alternative, but not something we can
mandate as the only solution.

I would prefer to keep Path, or at least something shorter that the
mouthfull that is currently proposed.

If you really must change it, then it should at least be hyphenated (twice)
for consistency with the other headers.

Note also that it no longer does the same as Record-Route, as Record-Route
is a bidirectional capability, and it was the same strong suggestions in
Minneapolis that precluded it having that one and same functionality.

All,

I feel profoundly lucky that yesterday and Friday were public holidays in
the UK :-)

Perhaps I can take advantage of this vantage point to offer a summary of the
thread. Protagonists please speak up if I have mis-represented you below,
but please don't re-open old fronts.

1) Call-Info

Long arguments about the alledged similarities/differences between Call-Info
and RPID. Suffice to say that the point has been made that Call-Info (and
perhaps other things) could be abused to do the things that RPID does, and
in particular to do the 'Bad Things' that some are worried about with RPID.
The point of disagreement was whether in the case of Call-Info, this would
be 'major abuse', with RPID was set up to make these 'Bad Things' easy, or
whether there was some equivalence.

The key point is that this kind of abuse of Call-Info may happen if we do
not provide an alternative.

2) Abuse of From/To headers

Jon is concerned that 'untrusted RPID' provides a standardised alternative
to From/To, allowing Bad Things, like never putting the real From/To
information in the From/To fields.

Others have pointed out that the draft explicitly states that untrusted UAs
MUST NOT add RPID. However the draft explicitly described proxy handling of
RPID headers from untrusted sources (proxies OR UAs), and allows these to be
propogated, marked as untrusted.

Therefore, a UA which DID add RPID, although non-compliant to the draft,
would have its RPID propogated through the network.

3) 'Untrustworthy RPID'

Flemming, Bill et al argued that RPID information is still useful when it is
'untrustworthy'. This can occur legitimately within the draft when an RPID
which is not 'private' (and so not encrypted) crosses a trust boundary. This
would represent an identity asserted by Network A and passed to Network B,
when B has no explicit trust relationship with A.

The contention was that since this information still has some value, it
should be passed to the UAS for display, and might also have some
application for call trace, although obviously not as useful as a
'trustworthy' identity.

Jon argued that the From field provides well enough for display, and the
value of untrustworthy information for call trace is debatable (and has been
debated at length).

There is agreement that some form of 'signed RPID' would be better.
Previously we have agreed on the need for a general mechanism to sign
information in SIP headers. Flemming has pointed out that if you agree to
have 'Signed RPID' then as a subset you have 'Untrustworthy RPID' (when you
don't recognise the signature). So removing 'Untrustworthy RPID' now would
be inconsistent, since there is already agreement to re-introduce it later.
That is unless you feel that the time interval during which Untrusted RPID
is not standardised is important.


Many other points were made, but the above seemed to me to be the key
issues.

And, now, my opinions:

1) Call-Info: I think the point has been made here - we're into judgement
calls on how bad an abuse X is compared to Y - I would rather there was no
need for people to abuse the protocol at all.

2) From/To: RPID is not the problem here, is it a solution to an underlying
problem with From/To. Blocking RPID will not solve the underlying problem,
and people will just route around to find another, probably worse, solution.
Better to address the real problem which has led people to propose
obfuscating From/To in the first place. If this problem is solved, then
there is no reason for people to want untrusted UAs to insert RPID. See
separate mail on this.

3) Untrustworthy RPID: I think Flemming and Bill have demonstrated the
utility of 'untrustworthy identity', and indeed this is what the From field
already provides. But From just provides the users assertion. If a network
has asserted additional identity information, why should the user should be
denied this ?

Having said that, the propogation of 'untrustworthy' RPID is strictly out of
scope according to the (retro-fitted) Applicability Statement. But then we
have agreement to add it 'in future' by virtue of the generic signing
mechanism - I guess this inconsistency is one for the ADs.

Regards,

Mark

This seems to be a key issue here, and one where I do share your concern.

To solve this we do need to solve the underlying problem which led to this
'abuse' of RPID. If we solve this problem, then I think all the rest of our
arguments drop out.

As I said before, I believe the arguments which led to this will lead to the
same place in other contexts - there is nothing special about this
particular 'customer' of SIP in this regard, so we really do need to solve
the root problem.

The root problem is this: A UA cannot place 'private' or 'potentially
private' information in the From or To fields.

This is because there is no mechanism defined to ensure that such
information is not passed to other UAs. In the absence of such a mechanism,
no requirements can be placed on what a UA does with the From/To fields. If
we do not place any requirements on these fields, then we cannot reliably
use them for anything.

We could argue about whether the very naming of the fields, examples in the
SIP spec, etc., define an implicit 'soft' requirement that they contain the
originator and desired destination (unless these are known to be private by
the UAC). The more we engineer this assumption into services, interworkings,
clients etc., then the more the implicit 'soft' requirement becomes in
practice an implicit 'hard' requirement.

We can see this already by the fact that a proposal in a particular system
to always include garbage in these fields causes such concern. People quite
reasonably want these fields to contain the real originator/destination.

In the case of a UA obtaining service from a public service provider, there
may be a requirement for the user to indicate their preferred originating
identity. This would naturally go in the From field, but it may be private
(to other UAs).

Equally, information which might usually be placed in From/To by the UA may
become private due to operation of services within the network. It would be
useful if this could be indicated in a simple way within a trust domain,
since modifying the From/To fields carries some cost.

My suggestions for what to do about this are:
1) We need to accept (and document) the fact that there will be many kinds
of privacy service, and many of these will require the modification of the
From/To fields. This cannot be done by Proxies (with 2543 compatibility), so
we must accept that any SIP-based public service offering (necessarily
incorporating privacy) cannot be based on proxies alone AND have 2543
compatibility.

2) Define a means for UAs to request privacy in respect of the From/To
fields (e.g. using a Generic URI parameter as proposed by Jon)

This would obviate the motivation for untrusted UAs to ever insert RPID. We
could change the privacy draft to differentiate between RPIDs received from
untrusted UAs and from untrusted proxies.

Regards...Mark

Apologies - the term 'public telephony' often has rather loaded meaning
round here and I mis-interpreted your comment. If you mean 'public service
provider' then I understand the distinction your are making.

What makes you think this ? At present a user receiving malicious calls at
work (from the PSTN) can ask for these to be traced. Why should they lose
this ability if their employer switches to a SIP-based telecommunications
service using the Internet ? (as well as getting worse QoS :-)

I think if it became widespread that corporations used Internet-based
telecommunications which did not support malicious call trace, then
regulators, not to say consumer groups and groups representing employees
might become concerned.

I would think we could make the SIP-based service at least as good as the
PSTN in this regard.

The 'trusted third party' in the form of the public service provider
performs a valuable service in mediating between the legitimate desire or
the caller to remain anonymous, and the equally legitimate desire for called
parties to be protected from malicious calls. A third party of some kind is
required to guard the privacy of the caller, whilst ensuring the tracebility
of the call.

Now there is no reason why this 'third party' needs to be a public service
provider. The same 'third party' function could be provided by proxies owned
by the corporations between which calls are being made.

We should be clear that if users choose to receive calls directly, without
such a 'trusted third party', then they will not receive the protection from
malicious calls that they are used to on the PSTN. It may be fine for
individual users to make this choice, but it is not something that anyone
providing service to many users (be that a commercial service, or an
employer providing telecommunications to their employees) could choose to
do.

So, we need mechanisms to enable this in as many scenarios as possible.

My concerns would extend to any service which inserted the real identity of
the user on their behalf, and did not provide a way for the user to turn
this off on a session by session basis.

I think in most (if not all) services on the Internet today, any identities
inserted by the network are user provided names which may or may not be
related to the users real identity.

Also, in practice, if a service always inserts the users real identity, this
is not mitigated by arguments along the lines of 'The header's semantics
mean that you should not always trust this identity' - the user may still
feel their privacy is compromised if their identity is given out without
their control, even if the header it is sent in is somehow marked as
'unreliable'.

So, if you wanted to build a service where an outbound home proxy inserted,
say, the user's photo for them, I think you would need a mechanism for the
user to prevent this happening on a per-session basis before the service
would be acceptable to the users, never mind the regulators. I guess you
could give the user a separate (virtual) outbound home proxy which did not
do this.

Anyway, your other comments suggested you did not see the need to proxies to
insert Call-Info at all, and if this were the case the problem goes away.

Dear All.

I need some help on this topic:

How can i protect a residential UA (my residential Sip Phone) from DOS
Attack like a flood of INVITE msg ??
In this scenario we don't have a validation since we need receive call from
anyone.
and .... anyone with a low bandwidth connection can make than my phone can't
stop of ring !!

Thanks in advance.

Gabriel.

Actually, Record-Route entries are NOT changed in the response, just
copied back towards the source. That is, they accumulate on the INVITE
message, and are returned to the UA on the 200OK response. I think the
text in "path" now has exactly the same behaviour. If it doesn't, I did
something wrong, so please verify . . .

Doing something like that which is explicitly out of scope for this
document in 4.2 is an attempt to force the home proxy to be in the path
of all SIP requests from this UA. Without some kind of mechanism, the UA
may not have any way to route requests thru that home proxy. In this
scenario, the pre-loaded route is consumed getting to the home proxy, so
I don't thgink what you're worried about here actually happens.

See draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-00.txt for discussion of this technique.

There was list discussion of this several weeks ago, and I recall
Jonathan Lennox made a definitive report on why RR is not the way to go.

The root problem is this: A UA cannot place 'private' or 'potentially
private' information in the From or To fields.  

This is because there is no mechanism defined to ensure that such
information is not passed to other UAs. In the absence of such a
mechanism, no requirements can be placed on what a UA does with the
From/To fields. If we do not place any requirements on these fields,
then we cannot reliably use them for anything.
------

I think this is statement of the situation clearly brings out the
misunderstanding driving this whole thing.

This logic will eventually lead us to deleting all headers or bodies
provided by the UA in at attempt to enforce "privacy" against the wishes
of the actual user. It also precludes intentially authenticating the
user to a service on the other side of the home proxy, as such
authentication by definition is an exposure of private information.

I would restate as follows:

"The SIP protocol explicitly sends the From and To fields to the
destination UA. Therefore the sending UA should only insert information
in the From and To fields that is intended to be delivered to other UAs
and potentially displayed to the user of the other UA. If the user of
the UA wishes to remain anonymous, they must not insert any information
into the From or To fields which compromises this anonymity. This same
caveat applies to every other aspect of SIP, including headers and
bodies, except for those elements which are explicitly removed or
encrypted by intermediate elements known to the UA."

I believe Henning has suggested doing a 401 challenge with null
authentication. This at least lets you know what IP address is flooding
you with INVITEs, which allows other steps to be taken.

Actually, it's not. The Applicability Statement allows for more than a
single domain and does not specify whether such domains have to trust
each other or not, so either case is allowed and hence described in the
document.

I like Ben's way of putting it - that my argument is philosophical. The
philosophical part is "pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate". Or to
translate that into IETF speak, "The protocol isn't finished when you have
nothing more to add - it's finished when you have nothing more to take
away."

I believe these principles are very relevant to the current discussion.
There are mechanisms in sip-privacy-04 (whose motivation is at best obscure,
at worst non-existent) that allow sip-privacy-04 to be abused - and not just
a 'potential', this has already happened; we have concrete examples of
customers of sip-privacy-04 who designed architectures around the abuse of
the document. I have argued that sip-privacy-04 has unnecessarily large
number of moving parts, which makes its eventual usage in the field
difficult to predict (already it's been suggested for unpopular uses that
weren't anticipated), and little internal justification for these systems.
By removing these potentially non-essential mechanisms we could close the
door on some of these abuses without, I think, impairing the system's
ability to operate. The Iraqi thread is essentially about this last point.

Maybe the draft should explain it rather than Bill.

Forgive me for not making a detailed answer to the points in this note,
though I'm sure the above citations will make it clear why I abstain.

I did want to speak to the consensus issue, though. I think most people are
monumentally indifferent to this draft, and probably the whole privacy
problem, and are looking for the fastest way out of this. Consensus is
impossible to gauge when nobody cares. That leaves us to debate the
technical merits (currently, the Iraqi thread). We should probably stick to
that rather than metadiscussion like the above.

Okay, so it's not Caller-ID any more, now it's malicious call trace. I don't
immediately see how this is a workable motivation either, though.

In the past, you have said of the Iraqi network example:

I agree with this, and I think it is at the crux of the matter at hand.
Trusted entities must consider a source from which they receive messages to
either be trusted or untrusted. The way the mechanism currently works, if
the originator of a request is untrusted, trust recipients add 'screen=no'
to any RPIDs in the request. Right? 

Okay, so now we take a user, Carol, and the Iraqi network. Both are
untrusted. Both send request to a trusted proxy, and both requests contain
an RPID. The trusted proxy adds 'screen=no' to each and forwards the
requests along. What fact about the requests, exactly, tells downstream
entities to 'kinda' trust the Iraqi RPID for malicious call trace, but not
to trust Carol's RPID? 

You go on to say:

[snip]

What this essentially means, I think, is that although you might not trust
the policies of the Iraqi network to ascertain identity, you still have to
treat it as if it is trusted, because well, that's the degree of certainty
with which the telephone network actually operates. What this means to me is
that you will configure your trusted proxies to treat requests coming from
the Iraqi proxy as if they are trusted - you should not set 'screen=no' on
these requests.

While I don't think Iraqi call trace provides any motivation for keeping
'screen=no' in the draft, this may suggest a requirement for somehow
describing the authentication policy that was used to ascertain someone's
identity (so that downstream entities can determine the degree to which they
should trust a particular RPID). Going down that road, however, would take
us far beyond the ISUP 'presentation restriction' concept, and certainly far
beyond anything in sip-privacy-04 today.

If we do, in the course of this discussion, eventually uncover a need for
'screen=no', I certainly hope it will be documented in sip-privacy-05.

I think you for some reason believe I am committed to the position that
signed RPIDs should be removed as 'untrusted'. In my last mail, I suggested
that signatures would render obsolete the concept of intrinsically trusted
or untrusted RPIDs. In this architecture there would be no role needed for
border elements that either set the screen parameter or remove RPIDs. That
whole concept goes away.

I think this is a place where we actually agree, but are using different
semantics. When you say:

[snip]

... I say, "But it isn't 'untrusted' anymore if it has a signature; the
concept of being intrinsically 'untrusted' is no longer meaningful." The end
result is the same - we agree that if an RPID is signed, it shouldn't be
removed.

Agreed that it isn't sip-privacy-04's job to define how messages are signed,
it is a general security problem. But I think we also probably agree that
the requirements sip-privacy-04 attempts to fulfill will only be partially
realized without that signing mechanism. 

I'm not arguing (now, anyway) that sip-privacy-04 should be delayed until
the awaited signing mechanism has been invented. All I was saying is that I
think the signing mechanism is completely unrelated to the motivation for
'screen'.

OK, so let's work with this and see where we get...

1) The UA may insert information which later becomes private due to the
operation of services within the network. The device that detects this must
either edit the From/To fields itself, or explicitly route to an Application
Server which can do this & anything else needed to provide the necessary
privacy.

Is everyone happy with this ? Can we descibe it somewhere ?

2) The From/To fields cannot be used for communication from UE to network
entities of identity information which the user wishes to be kept private
(no way to indicate this)

3GPP has a requirement for information of type (2). They had planned to use
RPID, since this was an element 'which is explicitly removed or encrypted by
intermediate elements known to the UA'. They cannot use the Authentication
mechanism, because in 3GPP this is only done at registration (with first hop
integrity used for subsequent transactions) and the information to transport
can change on a call by call basis.

So what should 3GPP use for this information ?

Regards,

Mark

I think if I sign an RPID with a signature that noone recognises, then this
is semantically equivalent to 'screen=no'.

Are you suggesting that a signed RPID should be discarded by the UAS if it
does not recognise the signature, or would it be displayed with a health
warning ?

<snip> 


3) 'Untrustworthy RPID' 

Flemming, Bill et al argued that RPID information is still useful when it is
'untrustworthy'. This can occur legitimately within the draft when an RPID
which is not 'private' (and so not encrypted) crosses a trust boundary. This
would represent an identity asserted by Network A and passed to Network B,
when B has no explicit trust relationship with A.

The contention was that since this information still has some value, it
should be passed to the UAS for display, and might also have some
application for call trace, although obviously not as useful as a
'trustworthy' identity.

Jon argued that the From field provides well enough for display, and the
value of untrustworthy information for call trace is debatable (and has been
debated at length).
[Peterson, Jon] Of greater concern to me is whether or not the existing
'screen' mechanism provides a way to use untrustworthy information for call
trace. If it does so (I still don't see how it does), then at the very least
I don't believe that usage is substantiated by the draft today.

There is agreement that some form of 'signed RPID' would be better.
Previously we have agreed on the need for a general mechanism to sign
information in SIP headers. Flemming has pointed out that if you agree to
have 'Signed RPID' then as a subset you have 'Untrustworthy RPID' (when you
don't recognise the signature). So removing 'Untrustworthy RPID' now would
be inconsistent, since there is already agreement to re-introduce it later.
That is unless you feel that the time interval during which Untrusted RPID
is not standardised is important.
[Peterson, Jon] I've argued (in a separate mail) that disallowing
'untrustworthy RPIDs' is not at all inconsistent with signing messages
later. Signing messages merely makes the concept of intrinsically trusted or
untrusted RPIDs go away - the concept of an intrinsically untrusted RPID is
not reintroduced by the ability to sign messages. Signing RPIDs just ushers
in an era of relativism, in which every entity is empowered to make its own
decision about trusting an RPID or not.


Many other points were made, but the above seemed to me to be the key
issues. 

And, now, my opinions: 

1) Call-Info: I think the point has been made here - we're into judgement
calls on how bad an abuse X is compared to Y - I would rather there was no
need for people to abuse the protocol at all.
[Peterson, Jon] Concisely put and undoubtedly accurate. 

2) From/To: RPID is not the problem here, is it a solution to an underlying
problem with From/To. Blocking RPID will not solve the underlying problem,
and people will just route around to find another, probably worse, solution.
Better to address the real problem which has led people to propose
obfuscating From/To in the first place. If this problem is solved, then
there is no reason for people to want untrusted UAs to insert RPID. See
separate mail on this.
[Peterson, Jon] Agreed. 

3) Untrustworthy RPID: I think Flemming and Bill have demonstrated the
utility of 'untrustworthy identity', and indeed this is what the From field
already provides. But From just provides the users assertion. If a network
has asserted additional identity information, why should the user should be
denied this ?
[Peterson, Jon] This is a line of reasoning we seem to come back to
repeatedly that really confuses me. RPID exists to provide call trace, not
Caller-ID, right? It allows the network to carry an identity when the user
wishes to remain anonymous, when they don't want to display their identity
to the other party in the dialog. If the network asserts identity
information, I don't think that information is intended to be displayed to
the user - so the user should actually be denied this information, right?

Having said that, the propogation of 'untrustworthy' RPID is strictly out of
scope according to the (retro-fitted) Applicability Statement. But then we
have agreement to add it 'in future' by virtue of the generic signing
mechanism - I guess this inconsistency is one for the ADs.

Mark

I think there is an ambition to use RPID for Caller ID as well as for Call
Trace. In particular, when interworking with the PSTN, the CLI needs to be
Network asserted - user asserted identity in the From field will not do.
This CLI is then used for both call trace and caller display.

Just as in the PSTN, displaying the network asserted identity at a SIP UA
will give the called party greater confidence in the identity - at least
their confidence should be as great as the confidence they have in the
network entity from which they received the message.

Alternatively, you could provide a way to indicate that the value in the
From field really does represent the identity of the caller (i.e. is valid
for the user who authenticated). Either the proxy ascertaining this could
sign it, or within a trust domain, it could be passed forwards as a simple
indication attached to the From field. Somehow I'm not sure you'll like
this!

It's a minor point of course, but I agree with Keith. Also, I suspect 
that for most implementations the decision of whether or not to use the 
short form is not made on a header by header basis, and so you're 
actually quite likely to see the long form most of the time.

Humbug - how does one apply that to philosophy ? Besides, as recent discussions
has exemplified, this has hardly been a guiding principle so far, so why now all
of a sudden for this draft ?

Well, I have provided with you reasons several times. Mark has just summarized
them this morning. As for your judgement of these, you can only speak for
yourself, but I have yet to see a lot of support for your position.

No they don't - the comments still stand and you have done nothing to convince
me otherwise. The fact that I have to continue repeating the same points over
and over again and you have failed to produce much support for your positions
only reaffirms my impression.

Probably true. The people that care have contributed throughout the process and
hence have already shaped the draft. The people that chose not to participate,
well at least most of them recognize that there has been plenty of opportunity
to participate, and hence have the decency to not try and derail the whole thing
at the very last minute with a long list of more or less philosophical
objections.

Well, we are not getting anywhere on that obviously. WG Last Call has completed
(a while ago actually), and I think it is in order for our chairs to gauge
consensus at this point and ensure timely progress in accordance with the
Working Group procedures defined in RFC 2418 - hopefully we don't need to
proceed to the RFC 2026 process. So far, I have only seen persistent objections
from you which would hardly seem to counter rough consensus.

Nobody has argued that an untrusted Remote-Party-Id is a reliable way of
performing call trace. However, if the Iraqi network is actually cooperating
with us, the trace will be performed. Had we removed instead, there would be
absolutely no tracing going on. Reliable and trustworthy - no . Better than
nothing - yes.

No, that's not what I said. I'm setting "screen=no" becuase I dont' trust it,
but if you request a call trace nevertheless, I will still try and do it since
that's the best we've got.

No - I think you haven't understood the point. A proxy that only uses the
mechanisms defined in the draft will remove a Remote-Party-Id it either doesn't
trust or can't verify. A (future) signature mechanism that can be associated
with a Remote-Party-Id is of no relevance to this proxy since it doesn't
understand it. Thus, despite the fact that it may have been a perfectly valid
Remote-Party-Id, as the signature indicates, the proxy will remove it anyway if
we follow your suggestion.

Good point (self-signed certificates come to mind as well). However,
let's not turn this into a crypto-discussion. We already have consensus
that this is not a requirement for the privacy draft.

Right - the second paragraph in Section 4 even explains this.

It seems that 3GPP could use an unsolicited Proxy-Authorization header
with the correct public identity identified as the username.

Actually, I thought I was just restating a point you made in an earlier
mail: If we're fine with proxies passing on signed RPIDs where they don't
recognise the signature, we should also be fine with proxies passing on
untrustworthy RPIDs i.e. those with 'screen=no', because the two are
equivalent.

The important point, then, is what we expect *UAs* to do with such things.
Jon's contention was, I think, that (effectively) that UAs should discard
them. Your contention was that the (human) user should decide what meaning
if any to attach to the information. If we're being consistent we should
have the same answer for 'screen=no' RPIDs as we have for signed RPIDs where
we don't recognise the signature.

It is an interesting question - it may not be solvable on the other hand it
may not need to solved as directly as you think.

With a modem set up as an auto dialer, I could make your current PSTN phone
unusable. I could flood your email box so you were likely over quota. I
could probably use up on the bandwidth on your WAN link. None of these DOS
issues seem to be a huge problem today. One reason is that there is some
hope you could trace back and figure out who was doing this to you then
perhaps filter or take legal action.

If this type of bandwidth matters to you, then you will compress and with
any half decent compression scheme the representation of the RRR token is
going to be the same no matter how long the uncompressed version is. Given
the length and design of SIP messages, it seems sort of futile to try and
optimize message size by any method other than compression at this point. I
don't care what we call it, but I don't think size matters.

Another possibility is to set your UA to only accept invites from a
known set of previous-hop proxies that you trust and are configured to
execute your chosen call screening policy.

I would argue that on the contrary we know that size *does* matter. 
Compression is great but you can't assume it's available everywhere.

If it is allowed to be defined. Surely I remember a discussion on the list
some time back saying that no new short form codings would be defined? Also
none of them are more than one character, so do we now start inventing 3
character ones? Certainly none of the recent headers added seem to have
short forms.

The piece of funtionality I was referring to is the UA handling of the
response. At that point things do get different. Up to that point, I believe
the handling is identical.

For the PSTN, this kind of attack is not common because it costs money
to make a call. It doesn't cost money to send email, and thats why there
is spam.

That said, the anonymous authentication mechanism can prevent DDOS
attacks on my phone, but not a direct targeted attack from a single
source.

No, it hasn't. THe BNF has the compact form listed. Its just not
mentioned in Section 20.37, and it probably should be listed there. I'll
note this.

OK, so let's work with this and see where we get... 
1) The UA may insert information which later becomes private due to the
operation of services within the network. The device that detects this
must either edit the From/To fields itself, or explicitly route to an
Application Server which can do this & anything else needed to provide
the necessary privacy.
Is everyone happy with this ? Can we descibe it somewhere ? 
2) The From/To fields cannot be used for communication from UE to
network entities of identity information which the user wishes to be
kept private (no way to indicate this)
3GPP has a requirement for information of type (2). They had planned to
use RPID, since this was an element 'which is explicitly removed or
encrypted by intermediate elements known to the UA'. They cannot use the
Authentication mechanism, because in 3GPP this is only done at
registration (with first hop integrity used for subsequent transactions)
and the information to transport can change on a call by call basis.
So what should 3GPP use for this information ? 
Regards, 
Mark 
-------

1) Absolutely not. The information is what was inserted by the UA. It
cannot become private "somewhere else in the network" for that dialog.
The only way to change it is to make a new dialog. Or maybe that's what
you mean and I'm just being dense.

2) part 1: Yes! Part 2: 3GPP terminals had better be able to use
Authentication anytime it's required by a downstream system or they
aren't conformant to the SIP model as I understand it. Just because they
think they are only going to authenticate REGISTER doesn't mean they can
get away with not supporting it in the other usual transactions. So I'd
suggest that if IETF can come up with something like a third-party
authentication model that adresses the transitive identity expression
requirements, that  3GPP could figure out how to use it.

It looks like UPDATE and Manyfolks are likely to be dependent on the
Reason header mechanism (imho). Given this (and the other requirements
discussions that we've heard), how do you people feel about proposing
this as a SIP WG effort? And yes, the SIP WG can identify work that
needs to be done to support other SIP WG efforts without having a
third-party generate a requirements RFC.

Not clear what will happen, I suspect most will echo it. However, don't
put it in.

If you don't have SRV, AND if the server for the domain is not on 5060
(both of which are bad, by the way), then use Reply-To.

The perils of putting ports in the From field are well documented, and
that is what motivated this decision. It needs to be a logical
identifier, period.

There is nothing special about 183. If you want to say "early media",
then let us just define a 1xx for it, rather than overloading 183. I
really don't get why everyone loves 183. The only provisional resposne I
think Reason makes sense for is 155.

Hi,

Yes, the only response that can carry Reason will be 155.

About the "early media" response, I do not think it is needed. The SDP
indicates everything needed for the user plane already.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Rohan,

I'm not sure Proxy-Authorization is appropriate because the information that
we need to supply is nothing to do with Authentication or Authorisation. The
user is already authenticated and the first-hop proxy knows which user the
INVITE is from by virtue of the first-hop integrity mechanism.

However, for a given user, there are multiple identities which that user is
allowed to use, and the user needs to select on a call by call basis which
of those is being used for this call.

If the user does not require any privacy, then this could go in the From
field. But if the user requires privacy, where should it put it ?

Information inserted by the UA absoutely can become private somewhere else
in the network.

Now if this means that a new dialog is required, then so be it, and then a
genuine full-blown B2BUA is required to mediate between incoming and
outgoing dialog.

Examples: (1) The user inserts their identity, but the subscriber of the
outgoing service being used requires outgoing sessions to be anonymous. Only
the outgoing proxy knows this - well, it's a B2BUA now.

(2) A calls B, who forwards to C. B requires privacy, but unfortunately A
has inserted B's identity in the To field. So the proxy performing
forwarding for B must modify the To field - OK, so it's a B2BUA too.

Anyone offering a public service will need to deal with (1).

Anyone offering a public service who wants to provide call forwarding will
need to deal with (2).

Also, as per my reply to Christian yesterday, it's unclear to me why these
requirements should not also apply to 'private' services in the case that
these are extended outside individual organsiations so as to effectively
replace 'public' services.

If we place no requirements whatsoever on the contents of the To/From
fields, then I guess we could argue that, like Subject: etc., it's not our
lookout what the UA puts in those fields. But we are a very long away from
this - the clear intention of the specification is that the To/From fields
should contain URIs for the called/calling parties resp. A genuine
'anonymous forwarding' service would probably have to remove things like
Subject as well.

It's hard to see how we could argue that service which did not operate as I
described in (1) & (2) had the necessary regulatory privacy capabilities
when we know very well that most UAs will put this information in the
From/To fields.

So, you can't offer a public SIP service without B2BUAs. I'm not casting
judgement on this situation, but I think we should be clear about where we
are. Is everyone happy with this ?

I'm sure that SIP clients on 3GPP mobiles will be able to cope with
Authentication requests from downstream proxies just as well as any other
SIP client. However the requirement in this case is for information to be
passed to the first-hop proxy on all calls.

There is no authentication exchange between UA and first-hop proxy, and
there is no need for an authentication function here because we are using a
first-hop integrity mechanism to link all messages between UA and first hop
proxy back to the authentication performed at registration.

This is not about authentication. It's about the need to pass some
supplementary information to the first-hop proxy which is needed for the
processing of the call, but which must not be shown to the UAS. This
information just so happens to be in the form of an identity.

I am less than interested in the screen parameter. It has never, even in the
PSTN, managed to convey information in the absence of the special
arrangement.

However I do want to see RPID (or identity in some form) from untrusted UAs.
Rather than the trusted entity performing verification in this case, I see
the functionality of this as allowing the real trusted entity to select from
a number of valid identities that it might otherwise insert. The fact that
it the identity inserted may appear identical to the received value does not
mean that it has been passed on transparently. All we need to do is clearly
indicate that this guidance was provided by an untrusted entity.

The PSTN case of the special arrangement has to be considered as a trusted
entity sending the information in the first place, and therefore is outside
the scope of this discussion, and therefore we do not need a screen
parameter in the way that this discussion is interpreting it.

You are concerned about somebody doing something the draft does not define,
and
in fact explicitly states it is not intended for. You have not provided any
technical problems with this, but are only concerned with the potential for
misuse. There is no point in either of us continuing to repeat the same
arguments on this point. If somebody else feels strongly about this point
and
has something technical to offer, they should speak up.

Bill already explained how malicious call trace works - you will not be able
to
call that party back.

Examples: (1) The user inserts their identity, but the subscriber of the
outgoing service being used requires outgoing sessions to be anonymous. Only
the outgoing proxy knows this - well, it's a B2BUA now.
[Peterson, Jon] One could just as easily argue that this is a requirement
not to force such services into the local outbound proxy. The UA could
always dynamically learn about privacy preferences from the service provider
in some fashion, and the service provider could reject requests (at the
local outbound) that don't conform to the privacy rules. And we should when
possible push SIP features to the endpoints anyway.

(2) A calls B, who forwards to C. B requires privacy, but unfortunately A
has inserted B's identity in the To field. So the proxy performing
forwarding for B must modify the To field - OK, so it's a B2BUA too.
[Peterson, Jon] If B redirects A to C instead, we might get some better
leverage on this problem - that could be one way that B could 'require
privacy'. Today the SIP spec RECOMMENDs that the To field in the new request
following the redirection be the same as the To field in the original
request (although it says UAs MAY update the To and whatnot if they are so
inclined) - however, the spec also allows you to insert replacement headers

: (1) The user inserts their identity, but the subscriber of the outgoing
service being used requires outgoing sessions to be anonymous. Only the
outgoing proxy knows this - well, it's a B2BUA now.
[Peterson, Jon] One could just as easily argue that this is a requirement
not to force such services into the local outbound proxy. The UA could
always dynamically learn about privacy preferences from the service provider
in some fashion, and the service provider could reject requests (at the
local outbound) that don't conform to the privacy rules. And we should when
possible push SIP features to the endpoints anyway. 

MW> I'm happy with any solution which works & the above sounds promising.
How would we get the privacy preferences to the UAC & is it backwards
compatible ? 

(2) A calls B, who forwards to C. B requires privacy, but unfortunately A
has inserted B's identity in the To field. So the proxy performing
forwarding for B must modify the To field - OK, so it's a B2BUA too.
[Peterson, Jon] If B redirects A to C instead, we might get some better
leverage on this problem - that could be one way that B could 'require
privacy'. Today the SIP spec RECOMMENDs that the To field in the new request
following the redirection be the same as the To field in the original
request (although it says UAs MAY update the To and whatnot if they are so
inclined) - however, the spec also allows you to insert replacement headers
into the URL, like:

Contact: sip:C@cleveland.com?To=anonymous@invalid.net
<mailto:sip:C@cleveland.com?To=anonymous@invalid.net> 

I bring these points up not because I disagree that intermediaries providing
privacy and identity will often need to be More Than Just A  Proxy - but I
think there are reasonable attacks on the examples you happen to raise here
that don't require resorting to a B2BUA. Let's not be too quick to close
doors. 

MW> The point I'm trying to make is exactly that intermediaries providing
privacy *will* often need to be More Than Just A Proxy, and I'm trying to
see if others on the list agree with this. Some of the 'Bad Things' that
people are concerned about with respect to From/To are happening because
people are trying to solve these privacy problems *without* realising that
they need More Than Just A Proxy.

With respect to your example, I can't see that you could trust A's UA to do
this correctly, and there is no device that the new A->C call will pass
through which could reject it if A does not follow the rules in the new URI.
Passing the privacy requirements back to the UA is a good idea, but only
works if there are proxies in a position to reject requests where the UA has
not obeyed the privacy requirements.

You can get early media as a normal part of call setup (e.g. ringing
provided at the terminating end), in preparation for moving you to a new
destination ("Your call is being forwarded to ..."), or as part of a call
failure sequence (e.g. "That number has changed.  Youc can now reach your
party at ...").  It might be useful for the caller's application to be able
to display the difference.

There is nothing special about 183. If you want to say "early media",
then let us just define a 1xx for it, rather than overloading 183. I
really don't get why everyone loves 183. The only provisional resposne I
think Reason makes sense for is 155.

Uh, if the failure/redirection is known in the signaling, then you
should be sending back a 3xx or whatever. The *only* purpose I know of
for early media is to deal with cases where you are talking to something
that CAN'T tell you via the signaling and instead sends you media.

Color me super confused.

MW> I'm happy with any solution which works &  the above sounds promising.
How would we get the privacy preferences to the  UAC & is it backwards
compatible ?
[Peterson, Jon]It sounds to me like an  instance of the general SIP UA
configuration problem - we already do have an  action item to tackle that.
Sure, there's work to be done, but the same is  true of the B2BUA approach.
Not sure what you're concerned about this being  backwards compatible with,
exactly.

MW> The point I'm trying to make is exactly that intermediaries  providing
privacy *will* often need to be More Than Just A Proxy, and I'm  trying to
see if others on the list agree with this. Some of the 'Bad Things'  that
people are concerned about with respect to From/To are happening because
people are trying to solve these privacy problems *without* realising that
they need More Than Just A Proxy.
[Peterson, Jon]Agreed (but we knew  that).

With respect to your example, I can't see that you could trust  A's UA to
do this correctly, and there is no device that the new A->C call  will pass
through which could reject it if A does not follow the rules in the  new
URI. Passing the privacy requirements back to the UA is a good idea, but
only works if there are proxies in a position to reject requests where the
UA  has not obeyed the privacy requirements.
[Peterson,  Jon]I can't imagine that, in any network likely to interest
you, A  wouldn't have a hardwired pre-loaded Route to its local outbound
that would  ensure the A->C path has some adult supervision, and that the
local  outbound would be in the redirection response path anyway (from the
Vias on  the original A->B request). If it is so exceptionally paranoid
about  misbehaving UAs, it could enact any number of policies to make sure
that  nothing goes awry.


ButI wonder, do the regulatory  constraints that make this a requirement
also levy a hefty fine on A if he  reveals to C in theensuing voice
conversation that he had originally dialedB? When the  redirection with
the Contact address I described in my last mailarrives at A, A would  have
to intentionally countermand it in order to reveal B's identityin the
signaling.ButA is of course empowered to reveal  B's identity through
other means anyway. I have a hard time seeing what the  big deal is.B only
remains anonymous at  A's sufferance  anyway.

I think the SIP WG should do the Reason header.

Are you suggesting that it would be added it to Bundle 2?

OK, I'll 'fess up.  I'm thinking of PSTN interworking situations, where, for
example, the forwarding is happening in the PSTN.

Uh, if the failure/redirection is known in the signaling, then you
should be sending back a 3xx or whatever. The *only* purpose I know of
for early media is to deal with cases where you are talking to something
that CAN'T tell you via the signaling and instead sends you media.

Color me super confused.

Dave.

I think all we need is 3 elements: a type (SIP, CPIM, Q.850, etc), a status
code, and a reason phrase. If an element does not know the type, it just
ignores it. It seems wasteful to have to make up and include a SIP status
code when all I want to do is pass the ISUP cause code. I also think we
should allow multiple Reason headers in case we have multiple types of
status codes.

MW> I'm happy with any solution which works & the above sounds promising.
How would we get the privacy preferences to the UAC & is it backwards
compatible ? 
[Peterson, Jon]  It sounds to me like an instance of the general SIP UA
configuration problem - we already do have an action item to tackle that.
Sure, there's work to be done, but the same is true of the B2BUA approach.
Not sure what you're concerned about this being backwards compatible with,
exactly.

MW> The point I'm trying to make is exactly that intermediaries providing
privacy *will* often need to be More Than Just A Proxy, and I'm trying to
see if others on the list agree with this. Some of the 'Bad Things' that
people are concerned about with respect to From/To are happening because
people are trying to solve these privacy problems *without* realising that
they need More Than Just A Proxy.
[Peterson, Jon] Agreed (but we knew that). 

With respect to your example, I can't see that you could trust A's UA to do
this correctly, and there is no device that the new A->C call will pass
through which could reject it if A does not follow the rules in the new URI.
Passing the privacy requirements back to the UA is a good idea, but only
works if there are proxies in a position to reject requests where the UA has
not obeyed the privacy requirements.
[Peterson, Jon] I can't imagine that, in any network likely to interest you,
A wouldn't have a hardwired pre-loaded Route to its local outbound that
would ensure the A->C path has some adult supervision, and that the local
outbound would be in the redirection response path anyway (from the Vias on
the original A->B request). If it is so exceptionally paranoid about
misbehaving UAs, it could enact any number of policies to make sure that
nothing goes awry.

But I wonder, do the regulatory constraints that make this a requirement
also levy a hefty fine on A if he reveals to C in the ensuing voice
conversation that he had originally dialed B? When the redirection with the
Contact address I described in my last mail arrives at A, A would have to
intentionally countermand it in order to reveal B's identity in the
signaling. But A is of course empowered to reveal B's identity through other
means anyway. I have a hard time seeing what the big deal is. B only remains
anonymous at A's sufferance anyway.

...Mark

Hi Jonathan,

I did not follow the last para in your response. Could you please explain
further the "anonymous" authentication mechanism that you are referring to
and how it can be effective in DDOS and your thoughts on direct DOS attack
mitigation, if "anonymous" method is ineffective.

Thanks,

- sonit

For the PSTN, this kind of attack is not common because it costs money
to make a call. It doesn't cost money to send email, and thats why there
is spam.

That said, the anonymous authentication mechanism can prevent DDOS
attacks on my phone, but not a direct targeted attack from a single
source.

MW> I'm happy with any solution which works & the above sounds promising.
How would we get the privacy preferences to the UAC & is it backwards
compatible ? 
[Peterson, Jon]  It sounds to me like an instance of the general SIP UA
configuration problem - we already do have an action item to tackle that.
Sure, there's work to be done, but the same is true of the B2BUA approach.
Not sure what you're concerned about this being backwards compatible with,
exactly. 

MW2> RFC2543 clients - how can I ensure the subscribers privacy requirements
are met if the user has an RFC2543 client ? If I'm not worried about this
case, then my proxy can easily just modify the From field, since dialog
matching is based only on the tags. 

MW> The point I'm trying to make is exactly that intermediaries providing
privacy *will* often need to be More Than Just A Proxy, and I'm trying to
see if others on the list agree with this. Some of the 'Bad Things' that
people are concerned about with respect to From/To are happening because
people are trying to solve these privacy problems *without* realising that
they need More Than Just A Proxy.
[Peterson, Jon] Agreed (but we knew that). 

With respect to your example, I can't see that you could trust A's UA to do
this correctly, and there is no device that the new A->C call will pass
through which could reject it if A does not follow the rules in the new URI.
Passing the privacy requirements back to the UA is a good idea, but only
works if there are proxies in a position to reject requests where the UA has
not obeyed the privacy requirements.
[Peterson, Jon] I can't imagine that, in any network likely to interest you,
A wouldn't have a hardwired pre-loaded Route to its local outbound that
would ensure the A->C path has some adult supervision, and that the local
outbound would be in the redirection response path anyway (from the Vias on
the original A->B request). If it is so exceptionally paranoid about
misbehaving UAs, it could enact any number of policies to make sure that
nothing goes awry. 

MW2> So the outbound proxy keeps a note of the Redirection redirection
request going back to A and then policies new INVITES coming in to spot the
redirected call and enforce B's privacy request ? So I need to keep this
state information about outstanding redirect requests that have been passed
to A. I guess it could be done, but it does not sound too great. 

 But I wonder, do the regulatory constraints that make this a requirement
also levy a hefty fine on A if he reveals to C in the ensuing voice
conversation that he had originally dialed B? 

MW2> No, the constraint in this case is really on B's Service Provider. If
this Service Provider offers a forwarding service, then they also ought to
offer an 'Anonymous Forwarding Service' where B's identity is not revealed
to C *by the network*. There is nothing to stop A revealing B's identity to
C.

The problem with just using SIP redirection, is that B's Service Provider
would then have chosen an implementation of the Call Forwarding service
which intrinsically causes B's identity to be revealed to C. Again, I think
the B's Service Provider would be on dodgy ground if they tried to represent
this as an 'Anonymous Forwarding Service' on the basis that 'it wasn't me
wot revealed B's identity, it was that villian A'.

I'll admit it is an open question as to how the identities in SIP will be
interpreted by regulators. The regulatory constraints apply to third parties
(e.g. Service Providers) releasing identity information about the end
users/subscribers. Is the information in the From/To fields being supplied
by the Service Provider, or the end user themselves ?? From a technical
perspective, obviously, it's being supplied by the end user, but it's not
the technical perspective which is used to evaluate the effect of these
regulations, it's the customer's perspective, which is not related to the
technology.

If I as a Service Provider *require* that the end user insert certain
information in these fields, then I am clearly responsible for the insertion
of the information, so I think I inherit some responsibility for preventing
privacy breachs as a result of this.

If I require that end users use SIP-compliant clients, then we inherit all
the requirements of the SIP spec. As I argued before, there is certainly an
implicit 'soft' requirement that the To/From fields should contain the
called/calling party address.

So, I would find it hard as a Service Provider to credibly argue that I have
no responsibility whatsoever for the information placed in these fields by
my users' equipment, when I have required them to be SIP compliant and when
the SIP spec implies so strongly that this information will be there. In the
case of 3GPP it is clearer, because the 3GPP spec will explicitly state what
will or won't be in the To/From fields. That is why it currently explicitly
states that there should be garbage in there, so I can be sure I'm not
responsible for it!

 When the redirection with the Contact address I described in my last mail
arrives at A, A would have to intentionally countermand it in order to
reveal B's identity in the signaling. But A is of course empowered to reveal
B's identity through other means anyway. I have a hard time seeing what the
big deal is. B only remains anonymous at A's sufferance anyway. 

MW2> Again, it's the distinction between the devices supporting the service
(UAs, Proxies etc.) releasing the information because this is intrinsic in
the Service I am offering, and information being released entirely due to
the whim of the human users themselves. The former is regulated, the latter
is freedom of speech.

Anyway, after all that, I was only arguing (a) that in a Service Provider
model, protection of the subscribers privacy would require More Than Just a
Proxy and (b) that Anonymous Call Forwarding would require 'More Than Just a
Proxy'. (assuming RFC2543 compatibility in both cases).

In both cases, you have provided alternative implementations. For (a) I
think your proposal is not compatible with 2543 clients, and for (b) it
requires MTJAP anyway. I actually think that if you drop the 2543
requirement, then you arrive at better solutions for all this. The
overloading of To/From with two completely distinct functions (identity and
dialog matching) in 2543 is a real pain.

Bis section 22. It is effective in the sense that you don't need to alert
the user or devote any resources or memory until the other side responds
to your null authentication request in a way that he proves he has seen
you challenge. Essentially, this verifies that the IP address that was
used in the first request is not completely bogus.

To be more exact, the anon method can prevent DDoS and DoS attacks that
use a forged IP address. This is pretty good in the sense that ingress
filtering isn't deployed all over in the Internet, and most attacks can
be prevented by verifying the addresses in this manner.

However, this does not prevent any of the attacks where the attacker is
willing to compromise its own address and position. There is little we
can do about such attacks for SIP or other protocols, except to send
in the police. (Though a virus-infected PC might not care about
its address being revealed, or the police finding it.)

I've submitted a draft that attempts to capture the presentation
and discussion of the refer security issues at IETF53. It adds a little
more detail to the message contents than shows in the slides. Until it

ok . but how my UA validate an invite message from a proxy ?? anyone can
impersonate my proxy.
in other words, a proxy can validate a UA but can a UA validate a proxy ?

thanks.

Another possibility is to set your UA to only accept invites from a
known set of previous-hop proxies that you trust and are configured to
execute your chosen call screening policy.

THis is supported in bis using TLS. The UAS would connect to its proxy
via TLS, and register to receive incoming invites on that connection. It
would validate that the proxy is its own proxy using the TLS procedures,
and then reject any incoming calls that do not arrive on that
connection.

Of course, this requires a long lived tls connection from the client to
the server. Nothing is for free....

Fine with me.  Update (155) and Manyfolks (183) are the two responses
identified in my previous emails as benefitting mostly from the
Reason method.

I have not heard from the authors yet, but it would be good to limit
the Reason header in responses to the above two, as opposed to
making it a general header field for all responses.  Otherwise,
there'll be too many ways to propogate reasons in responses -- the
normal SIP response codes and the Warning header in responses
already exist.

We (James Undery et al) got very clear negative feedback for our 
Proxy-to-UAS authentication extensions in Minneapolis. It currenly 
seems that UAS will not be able to validate a Proxy with HTTP 
authentication headers - unless you don't want to put B2BUA's in 
every last-hop proxy. 

Another potential extension to SIP/HTTP authentication would have 
been to allow proxy to forse UAS for authentication with 
terminating calls (because it can already authenticate UAC with 
originating calls). HTTP authentication framework really works 
only for one direction between UA and proxy - three other 
'directions' are uncovered. The case where the clients forse the 
servers to authenticate was never covered by undery-draft(s). 

I think that folks don't care about the last-hop-proxy authentication 
because UAS can always challenge the UAC at the other end e.g. with 
this "anonymous" authentication. This provides some security even if 
you didn't have the TLS connection open with the proxy. However, I 
think that the security related to the last-hop-proxy is still 
somehow problematic issue in SIP.

The draft talks about the use of REFER outside a dialog:

"A REFER request MAY be placed outside the scope of a dialog created =
with an INVITE."

"A UA accepting a well-formed REFER request SHOULD request approval from =
the user to proceed"

I am not sure what kind of approval are we talking about here ?
If a REFER comes from a proxy to a SIP phone or a gateway (with multiple =
lines on it), what are we supposed to do ? Surely not ring the phone ?

Mark,

I like your synopsis above of the situation. Likewise, you could add, if 
users choose to originate their calls without such a "trusted third party", 
then they will not receive the protection from having their identity passed 
to some unknown user that they are used to on the PSTN.

There needs to be an understanding that we are addressing two different 
architectures in these discussions:

1. With a trusted third party (Read: service provider) who guarantees 
privacy/protection/etc. (usually because the law says they must)
2. Without a trusted third party (Read: Wild-wild west) in which no one using 
it is guaranteed of anything.

Mike

Whatever is appropriate for the device and application - it may
be a direct prompt of the user, it may be a matter of using policy
that the user has placed in the device.

Why not? I've heard of phone implementations that provide a special
alert and put a "X is requesting that you call Y, proceed?" type prompt
on the display. On a gateway, your interface is obviously more limited.
If you were ambitious, you could invoke media/ivr servers, alert the
black phone, play the prompt above to it and ask for what to do.Or you
could decide its not worth extending this kind of functionality to the
old phones. There's a lot of room for innovation in between.

I think by the IVR approach, you mean REFER in a
dialog context.

That kind of an approach seems to be much more
preferable, as it works for all endpoints unlike the one w/o
a dialog which tries to do similar things. The caller obviously
wont know that the destination is a smart phone or not.

Ironically, w/o dialog seems to be syntactically more general.
Maybe its use should be restricted somehow for interop
reasons or so ?

A caller doesn't know if the destination will accept an INVITE
either. That's what the response part of the SIP transaction is for.
If you send an out-of-band refer to something that by policy or
reason of physical limitations can't deal with it, it will decline.

REFER is a primitive, not an application. We've been able to build
one application on top of REFER (transfer) without invoking Require:.
Some future application may need to know that the far end is going
to do something special with a REFER before it sends it - that 
application will use a Require: token.

I've seen no reason to introduce any such restriction.

If there's no "third party" then the user does not need to include any
identity information in the message at all. The end-to-end model tips the
balance completely to the side of the caller & their desire to remain
anonymous (or in the absence of a PKI, to mis-represent themselves).

Absolutely, and I think our generic privacy requirements draft will need to
start with a description of the models we are addressing and an analysis of
exactly *whose* privacy we are protecting in each model.

For example, the concept of 'subscriber' only exists in a 'service provider'
model.

I wonder whether the case of enterprise networks sending calls over the
Internet is a third model - its characteristics are slightly different.
There is no 'Service Provider' as such, but the enterprise(s) are 'providing
a service' to the users.

I want to explore the option of removing Referred-By a little.

As the refer-sec-options draft points out, traditional phone
systems don't provide the kind of information Referred-By is
trying to provide during a transfer. We've set our goals higher
for SIP transfer, which is a good thing to do, but is it necessary
for a base version of the application? Would a transfer application
that didn't tell the transfer target who initiated the transfer be
sufficient?

Perhaps the Referred-By functionality should be an extension (Requires:)
to REFER instead of part of its base definition?

This would remove the security issue with base REFER (B's triggered
request would be indistinguishable from a request that B initiated on
its own - there is no claim in the request that the request exits
because A asked for it to happen). 

The current work on securing Referred-By would continue in an extension
draft, but advancement of REFER would not be blocked on its completion.

SIP/SIPPING meeting like we did in Dallas between IETF 49 and 50.  I'd
like to here from folks *privately* please if they are interested in such
an interim meeting, probably during the month of May.  Also if you are
strongly opposed to such a meeting, I would like to hear from you
*privately* as well.

As for the possible locations, I am currently entertaining both Flagstaff,
Arizona, and Boston.  I can get a very good room rate for one, and the
other is easier for most folks to get to.  If you send me *private* mail
in support of an interim meeting, your location suggestion is also appreciated.

As always, any interim meeting has to be announced on ietf-announce at
least 30 days before the meeting, so please get me your comments early.
For your convenience, you can just click on the apropriate link.

Yes Reply:  mailto:rohan@cisco.com?Subject=[sip-interim-yes]

No  Reply:  mailto:rohan@cisco.com?Subject=[sip-interim-no]

thanks,
-rohan

The compelling case I still see for the screen parameter is due to the
extensibility of identity types.  If an RPID header arrives at a proxy
with an unknown identity type (only because that proxy has not yet
received its upgrade), it does not seem reasonable to strip it.
Otherwise, a new identity type can't be used until _every_ proxy
in the path has been updated.

Bill makes a good point. Plus it's worryingly quiet today, so let's see if I
can summarise again...

There are actually two applications for 'screen=no' RPID which we have been
discussing:
1) RPID inserted by a UA, to give a 'hint' to the outbound proxy as to which
identity it would like to be known by
2) RPID inserted by a Proxy with 'screen=yes' which is later downgraded to
'screen=no' because it passes into another trust domain

(1) is required by 3GPP - well *a* solution is required, not necessarily
RPID. Some people have suggested using unsolicited Proxy-Authorization
instead, but as this function has nothing to do with authentication, I'm not
sure this is appropriate - does anyone disagree, or have another suggestion
?

(2) is a question of whether such 'screen=no' information has any value. We
had a long thread (the Iraqi thread) about whether this would be useful for
Call Trace, which I think foundered on the inability to distinguish between
a type (2) 'screen=no' RPID and a type (1) 'screen=no' RPID which has made
its way unchanged from a UAC which is trying to mis-represent itself.

So the remaining question is whether type (2) 'screen=no' RPID is worth
displaying to the user (with appropriate health warnings) - I can't see how
it's any less valuable than the From: field, and everyone wants to display
that.


I do think that the discussion about (1) above, and the 3GPP requirement, is
really quite a distinct issue from the 'Bad Things' that are presently in
the 3GPP specifications, namely the obfuscation of the To/From fields. This
is much more related to our other thread on how to provide privacy services
and the requirement to modify To/From to provide certain privacy services.

I think that if we were agreed that modification of To/From *is* required in
order to provide (certain) privacy services (and the device that does this
thus needs to be More Than Just A Proxy), then there is no excuse for always
obfuscating To/From i.e. I don't think the 'Bad Things' and RPID are in fact
related as has been claimed.

Regarding the issue of UA inserting RPID, versus the proxy inserting 
RPID, ---

There was a lengthy discussion around bis-WGLC about proxies
modifying the SDP (not allowed according to bis) and the fact that
firewall control proxies do.  The conclusion, IIRC, was that the
definition acording the spec would not always be consistent with
the marketing term for a product -- mainly due to the fact that
firewall control proxies did not want to be lumped in the same
category of "bad things" as B2BUAs.

I see the same thing likely here.  Whether the box that interfaces
to the user is a UA, or a "UA-with-integrated-proxy", it will certainly
be marketed as a UA.  If the market for the device requires that it 
do functions that are only allowed to be done by a proxy, it will
be done.  Perhaps the term will then be "B2BUA with Proxy".  The
point is, it shouldn't matter how the architectural elements are combined
and optimized to do the job.

Bill makes a good point. Plus it's worryingly quiet today, so let's see if I
can summarise again...

There are actually two applications for 'screen=no' RPID which we have been
discussing:
1) RPID inserted by a UA, to give a 'hint' to the outbound proxy as to which
identity it would like to be known by
2) RPID inserted by a Proxy with 'screen=yes' which is later downgraded to
'screen=no' because it passes into another trust domain

(1) is required by 3GPP - well *a* solution is required, not necessarily
RPID. Some people have suggested using unsolicited Proxy-Authorization
instead, but as this function has nothing to do with authentication, I'm not
sure this is appropriate - does anyone disagree, or have another suggestion
?

(2) is a question of whether such 'screen=no' information has any value. We
had a long thread (the Iraqi thread) about whether this would be useful for
Call Trace, which I think foundered on the inability to distinguish between
a type (2) 'screen=no' RPID and a type (1) 'screen=no' RPID which has made
its way unchanged from a UAC which is trying to mis-represent itself.

So the remaining question is whether type (2) 'screen=no' RPID is worth
displaying to the user (with appropriate health warnings) - I can't see how
it's any less valuable than the From: field, and everyone wants to display
that.


I do think that the discussion about (1) above, and the 3GPP requirement, is
really quite a distinct issue from the 'Bad Things' that are presently in
the 3GPP specifications, namely the obfuscation of the To/From fields. This
is much more related to our other thread on how to provide privacy services
and the requirement to modify To/From to provide certain privacy services.

I think that if we were agreed that modification of To/From *is* required in

But as has been noted before, the IP address itself may be enough to violate 
someone's privacy. And the end user can't leave that out. If that is to be 
hidden in certain cases, there needs to be another device in between. 
Likewise, if the calling party identity is not provided, in many networks the 
call will never be carried, due to the requirements at the terminating end.

And I would argue that, without a "subscriber" or a "service provider", there 
is no concept of a service being provided. And most of what we're talking 
around are "services". So that is a real quandry. I would suggest that we 
further expand on the two situations I listed as follows:

1. With a trusted third party (Read: service provider) which provides 
services, one of those services being to guarantee privacy/protection/etc.
2. Without a trusted third party (Read: Wild-wild west) meaning that there 
are no services being provided. End users do anything they want and no one is 
guaranteed of anything (e.g., privacy, protection, or that anything they try 
to do will neccesarily function as they expect).

Maybe all discussions need to be split between these two cases, since they 
are so much different.

Yes, I would consider the enterprise network as the "service provider" even 
if distinct parts of it are interconnected by some other IP network. This 
includes two cooperating and trusting enterprise networks. 
Privacy/authentication/encryption/etc. between various parts of the 
enterprise network(s) are the responsibility of that network(s). The user 
doesn't need to deal with these issues. It only needs to worry about between 
itself and its "trusted third party" that is providing service.

You can't. You can NEVER prevent a client from giving away his identity.
For exampe, they might add  an SMIME body conatining their name and a
URL to their home-nudie-pix site. At the very best, the privacy draft
documents a means by which a client requests the server not to add

Hi,

A couple folks have asked for my motivation for suggesting an interim.
Basically we've got a lot of stuff on our plate in both WGs, and much of
it is in that midway done phase were face time is most valuable.
An interim would give us time to resolve several sticky technical issues
and then get drafts out before the cutoff date for IETF54.  I think
we could have a much more productive meeting in Japan as a result.

Topics in serious need of face time:

- the longer term privacy solution
- a whole raft of security issues
- REFER, replaces, and cc-transfer
- call info and conf info packages
- multiparty and conferencing requirements/frameworks
- possibly more ISUP interworking issues
- possibly a working session to revise the AAA requirements draft

The last two would depend on critical mass of folks willing to work on
these.

thanks,

I am not sure we are talking about the same thing, so let me describe
the scenario:

A and B are two endpoints not involved in any call. So A sends
a REFER to B. (Both A and B support the REFER).

Now going back to your reply, I dont understand how you can
alert B and play an ivr etc, without first setting up a dialog with it.

Also, I am confused how the "Require:" header fits into this
discussion.

And this restriction can only be relevant to a proxy that has a trust or
contractual relationship with the request origin. There is nothing,
morally, legally and technically, that a caller can and should do about
my inbound proxy adding whatever information my inbound proxy has legal
access to, even if that includes the google search result that reveals
that 'playboy' is the top site related to the caller's name.

I'd only wish that the privacy concerns expressed here could be
implanted into the louds using cell phones in public places.

If you have a sip phone, you don't need to invoke an ivr - you don't
need a dialog. The implementations I describe provide a special alert
and a prompt.

To get to the IVR driving black phone example, you have to have
an application that fronts the pstn gateway - the pstn
gateway itself will likely reject out-of-band refers for lack
of a way to get user permission to do something reasonable. 
(likely only in a time-local sense - there are _vast_ opportunities
for innovation here). The server running that application will
terminate the REFER and enter into a series of INVITEs, establishing
the sessions you talk about, to build authorization, then possibly
entering into a 3pcc-like control mode with the gateway to deal with
the referred action.

You suggested (abstractly) to limit out-of-band REFERs because
of potential interop problems. I counter that the first application
of REFER does not have those interop problems and that if interop 
problems are encountered in future applications, they can be addressed
through judicious application of Require:.

Sounds reasonable to me. I think it would be possible to phrase the draft in
a way that when we add in a Referred-By that it does not need a Requires and
that REFERs without a Referred-By are just treaded as the Referred-By as

Whether "traditional" phone systems provide the sort of information that 
is
carried by Referred-By or not, depends on your definition of "traditional
phone system" and the context in which REFER is being used. There are 
several examples of the availability of "Referred-by" type of information
to be found in today's telephone systems:

- ISDN's (Q.931) Redirecting Number Information Element
- QSIG's (ECMA-178) rerouteingNumber element in the Call Transfer Initiate
  operation
- DPNSS' ....

Etc.

Leaving out all the "nice bits" may result in something that will do the
job (i.e. achieve the call transfer), but this also restricts new services
to be implemented, because there simply isn't enough information to infer
what's going on.

Regards,

Frank






Sounds reasonable to me. I think it would be possible to phrase the draft 
in
a way that when we add in a Referred-By that it does not need a Requires 
and
that REFERs without a Referred-By are just treaded as the Referred-By as
unknown or anonymous.

The implications of Data Protection in this environment are hard to fathom,
but I think it's only possible to understand them if you look at the
'service' that is being provided in a 'protocol-neutral' way. The Service
Provider is responsible for the operation of the service, full stop. - how
the implementation of the service is decomposed between devices is of not
interest to regulators etc.

If a Service Provider places certain requirements on a device, in order to
access the service, then the Service Provider is responsible in some sense
for the actions of the device in meeting those requirements - the device
could not do otherwise if it wants service. So you can't say that 'The UA is
responsible for the actions of the UA' when these are actions which are
*required* in order to access the service. In the majority case the Service
Provider provided the client anyway.

If part of the service is 'I'll carry any old piece of data you give me to
the called party' then obviously the responsibility for that data, and what
it contains, is entirely with the UA/user.

If part of the service is 'I'll carry the information you put in field X to
the called party, and by the way you should put your identity in field X',
then we are on much more dodgy ground, in particular when the identity of
the caller turns out to contain 'personal data' of someone else (e.g. the
subscriber).

In a service provider example, think of this from the point of view of the
subscriber. The subscriber has asked for all calls from this subscription to
be anonymous - they have a right to ask for this. I think the subscriber
would have a hard time if they tried to beat up the service provider because
one of the users specially configured their client to put their name in an
SMIME body - it is part of the service that bodies are carried transparently
(now if the subscriber wants a special 'body removal' service, then I'm sure
this could be arranged, at a price, though it sounds quite painful, not to
say terminal).

On the other hand, if the subscriber finds that all calls go through with
the name and SIP URL of the calling user in the From field, I think the
Service Provider would have a hard time arguing that they were taking
reasonable steps to ensure the subscribers wishes.

I'm not arguing that proxies need to be able to do this - I'm pointing out
that there are 'privacy services' which certain kinds of service provider
need to provide, which require More Than Just a Proxy, as Jon puts it. I
think it's important we understand this, as some people have the mistaken
impression that such 'privacy services' can be implemented on standard
proxies.

You seem to be arguing that privacy services in the network which modify
From/To are not required at all. This could only be the case if the
'From/To' information had the same status as, say, SMIME bodies in terms of
what the UA is required to put in there. OK, so the SIP spec does not state
a hard requirement on what should be put in there, but there is certainly a
clear implication that it should be the calling/called party identities and
indeed this *is what we want* to happen for the consistent operation of SIP
services.

We can obviously debate how responsible a Service Provider would be for
information inserted in the From/To field, when the Service Provider has not
made any hard requirements on the UA other than that they follow the SIP
spec. Service Providers in 3GPP are certainly of the view that the present
ambiguity in the SIP spec *does not* give them enough to be *sure* of
avoiding responsibility. They have two choices:
a) Accept the responsibility, and provide privacy services as I have
described
b) Decline the responsibility by explicitly requiring that the UA *does not*
put potentially private information in these fields

There is no option of 'Decline responsibility, but refer to the SIP spec for
what the UA does with these fields' - it is just not safe enough, given that
the clear implication and intention is that the UA puts identity information
into From/To. I *know now* that most clients will put personal data of the
subscriber in the From field. In 3 years time, can I really argue to a
regulator with integrity that I took reasonable steps to protect the
subscribers privacy if I do not modify this field ??

Other users of SIP will face the same dilemma - which option would you
prefer them to choose ?

The 'protocol-neutral' approach has certainly been the approach in the past,
and a reasonable bet for this case too.  Consider the service changes that
were required in the transition from microwave to fiber - none.

Different jurisdictions have different views on data protection, too.  For
example, CLIR is the default in California, and in other states it is not.

The interesting case, of course, is handling the jurisdictions (like 
California) where the Service Provider is expected to do something, whether
the subscriber cooperates in asking for it or not.  There are two types
of cars in the US, California-emissions and everywhere-else; I shudder
to think of the same approach to SIP User Agents.

The implications of Data Protection in this environment are hard to fathom,
but I think it's only possible to understand them if you look at the
'service' that is being provided in a 'protocol-neutral' way. The Service
Provider is responsible for the operation of the service, full stop. - how
the implementation of the service is decomposed between devices is of not
interest to regulators etc.

If a Service Provider places certain requirements on a device, in order to
access the service, then the Service Provider is responsible in some sense
for the actions of the device in meeting those requirements - the device
could not do otherwise if it wants service. So you can't say that 'The UA is
responsible for the actions of the UA' when these are actions which are
*required* in order to access the service. In the majority case the Service
Provider provided the client anyway.

If part of the service is 'I'll carry any old piece of data you give me to
the called party' then obviously the responsibility for that data, and what
it contains, is entirely with the UA/user.

If part of the service is 'I'll carry the information you put in field X to
the called party, and by the way you should put your identity in field X',
then we are on much more dodgy ground, in particular when the identity of
the caller turns out to contain 'personal data' of someone else (e.g. the
subscriber).

In a service provider example, think of this from the point of view of the
subscriber. The subscriber has asked for all calls from this subscription to
be anonymous - they have a right to ask for this. I think the subscriber
would have a hard time if they tried to beat up the service provider because
one of the users specially configured their client to put their name in an
SMIME body - it is part of the service that bodies are carried transparently
(now if the subscriber wants a special 'body removal' service, then I'm sure
this could be arranged, at a price, though it sounds quite painful, not to
say terminal).

On the other hand, if the subscriber finds that all calls go through with
the name and SIP URL of the calling user in the From field, I think the
Service Provider would have a hard time arguing that they were taking
reasonable steps to ensure the subscribers wishes.

I'm not arguing that proxies need to be able to do this - I'm pointing out
that there are 'privacy services' which certain kinds of service provider
need to provide, which require More Than Just a Proxy, as Jon puts it. I
think it's important we understand this, as some people have the mistaken
impression that such 'privacy services' can be implemented on standard
proxies.

You seem to be arguing that privacy services in the network which modify
From/To are not required at all. This could only be the case if the
'From/To' information had the same status as, say, SMIME bodies in terms of
what the UA is required to put in there. OK, so the SIP spec does not state
a hard requirement on what should be put in there, but there is certainly a
clear implication that it should be the calling/called party identities and
indeed this *is what we want* to happen for the consistent operation of SIP
services.

We can obviously debate how responsible a Service Provider would be for
information inserted in the From/To field, when the Service Provider has not
made any hard requirements on the UA other than that they follow the SIP
spec. Service Providers in 3GPP are certainly of the view that the present
ambiguity in the SIP spec *does not* give them enough to be *sure* of
avoiding responsibility. They have two choices:
a) Accept the responsibility, and provide privacy services as I have
described
b) Decline the responsibility by explicitly requiring that the UA *does not*
put potentially private information in these fields

There is no option of 'Decline responsibility, but refer to the SIP spec for
what the UA does with these fields' - it is just not safe enough, given that
the clear implication and intention is that the UA puts identity information
into From/To. I *know now* that most clients will put personal data of the
subscriber in the From field. In 3 years time, can I really argue to a
regulator with integrity that I took reasonable steps to protect the
subscribers privacy if I do not modify this field ??

Other users of SIP will face the same dilemma - which option would you
prefer them to choose ?

The root problem is this: A UA cannot place 'private' or 'potentially
private' information in the From or To fields.  

This is because there is no mechanism defined to ensure that such
information is not passed to other UAs. In the absence of such a
mechanism, no requirements can be placed on what a UA does with the
From/To fields. If we do not place any requirements on these fields,
then we cannot reliably use them for anything.

I think this is statement of the situation clearly brings out the
misunderstanding driving this whole thing.

This logic will eventually lead us to deleting all headers or bodies
provided by the UA in at attempt to enforce "privacy" against the wishes
of the actual user. It also precludes intentially authenticating the
user to a service on the other side of the home proxy, as such
authentication by definition is an exposure of private information.

I would restate as follows:

"The SIP protocol explicitly sends the From and To fields to the
destination UA. Therefore the sending UA should only insert information
in the From and To fields that is intended to be delivered to other UAs
and potentially displayed to the user of the other UA. If the user of
the UA wishes to remain anonymous, they must not insert any information
into the From or To fields which compromises this anonymity. This same
caveat applies to every other aspect of SIP, including headers and
bodies, except for those elements which are explicitly removed or
encrypted by intermediate elements known to the UA."


[KED] I think the issues here are that the SIP specification very clearly
indicates that an identity is inserted in the From field (   The From header
field indicates the logical identity of the initiator of the request,
possibly the user's address-of-record. Like the To header field, it contains
a URI and optionally a display name. ) and therefore the protocol denies the
user privacy in this respect. Secondly, if the user has the ability to
insert information in this area, then this is not a location that can be
used for inserting a network asserted identity. I do not therefore see the
From header as a place for putting this network (third party) asserted
calling user identity.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting we abandon the Referred-By idea. I'm
suggesting we start with a version of REFER that doesn't provide it
and bring it back in with a follow-on extension to REFER.

Pardon me if I'm being obtuse, but how do I tell whether an INVITE is as
a result
of a REFER or not if Referred-By is dropped? A calls B. B REFERs A to C,
A calls
C. If C can not tell that the call is a result of a referral from A then
the REFER mechanism
has been reduced into one of "hey don't call me call them!", i.e. the
call from A to C is
disassociated from the dialog between A and B.

Dropping Referred-By could preclude many applications. Okay, an
extension to bring
it back in would enable them, but wasn't the idea of REFER that it be a
primitive to
enable such applications? The obvious example is where C wants to only
accept calls
which have been vetted by B. Irrespective of  security requirements,
this requires
that the primitive have a reference to B in A's request to C. How about
applications
where I would want to treat INVITEs differently according to where the
REFER came
from? E.g. accept calls referred from P.A. but fwd those reffered from
Marketing to my
voice-mail service.

On the question of authenticating the referral I prefer the option of C
VERIFYing with
A. Why wouldn't A put a meaningful contact address in Referred-By: and
expect C
to blindly accept the referral without the option of being able to
contact A? Thats not
to say that I don't thing the S/MIME option isn't possible - I'm just
uneasy about
man-in-the-middle.

No - that's a separate problem. The kind of association you are
looking for here is what's being addressed through the Replaces header.

There are _clearly_ good applications waiting for the Referred-By
functionality. I am _NOT_ advocating we abandon providing it. What
I'm asking is whether or not the base level transfer application
really needs it. There are already fielded implementations that don't
use it providing some evidence that you have a useful service without
it.

I don't follow - you're suggesting that if C tried to contact A and
failed, it would just accept the request by default?

The real problem here is that it may be very difficult for A to
provide a contact to C that will  get back to the UA that has the
knowledge about sending the REFER. Its the same problem
we have with getting B's INVITE-Replaces to the same C we had
a consultative-hold conference with.

Hi All,

To quickly summarize - the Referred-By is undoubtedly a good thing to put
into a request resulting out of a REFER. However to quote the REFER draft 
<<quote>>
If the URL is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the REFER request should
be copied into the request sent to the referred-to resource.
<<endquote>>

It seems to me that this of "SHOULD" strength, and anybody not
willing/wanting to send it - need not. I am of the opinion that we use the
appropriate mechanisms (either the SMIME/ or direct transferor to transfer
target verification method) to ensure that this Referred-By is verifiable.
Also if the transferor is wanting to protect itself it could always put in a
URI of the nature:
	sip:anonymous@anonymous.net

and allow the transfer target the choice to accept or deny the call.

Removal and converting it into Requires does not buy us much. I vote that we
continue down the path as suggested in drafts-sparks-sip-sec-options-00 and
leave the Referred-By header as is.

Thanks,

Sriram

That's exactly the point - you wouldn't.

No - that's a separate problem. The kind of association you are
looking for here is what's being addressed through the Replaces header.

There are _clearly_ good applications waiting for the Referred-By
functionality. I am _NOT_ advocating we abandon providing it. What
I'm asking is whether or not the base level transfer application
really needs it. There are already fielded implementations that don't
use it providing some evidence that you have a useful service without
it.

I don't follow - you're suggesting that if C tried to contact A and
failed, it would just accept the request by default?

The real problem here is that it may be very difficult for A to
provide a contact to C that will  get back to the UA that has the
knowledge about sending the REFER. Its the same problem
we have with getting B's INVITE-Replaces to the same C we had
a consultative-hold conference with.

Not really. The e2e model cuts both ways: the called party may decide to
refuse calls that do not carry some form of identification, or at least
some form of authorization. The real privacy issue is to devise a
structure in which the caller discloses enough to convince the called
party to pick up the call, but not so much as to compromise privacy. In
SIP, the caller has also to convince potential relays to forward the
call, and the same privacy issue arises: disclose enough to convince the
intermediate party to carry the call, but not so much as to compromise
privacy.

There is a big difference between private services and public services
subject to regulation. In the latter case, third parties mandate some
level of disclosure to the network, e.g. for law enforcement purposes. A
private service may be content to forward a call using for example a
role identifier instead of a user identifier; a public service may be
requested to actually identify the user, i.e. to request more
information than the caller is willing to disclose to the called party.
This is what drives us into a band-aid architecture, in which
information is supposedly first disclosed and then at a latter stage
withdrawn.

Actually, you can use the IPv6 "privacy address" for that purpose. For
example, you could build up an address that is only used for one
specific call.

Robert,

I have two big problems with this proposal.

The first is that a UA can treat a Referred-By header the same as it can
a From header, since both are equally unverified and authenticated.  If
a UA is doing call screening, it can't possibly use From headers, and it
can't use Referred-By - it must use some other mechanism.  If
Referred-By is "bad" then so is "From" - which of course is ridiculous.
I would support work on an extension to REFER to allow authenticated
Referred-By, but this doesn't preclude the use of an authenticated
Referred-By.

I agree that we are all working to provide "better than PSTN" services
and features.  If we strip the Referred-By header now, and instead add
it back as an extension, there will always be implementations that don't
include it, and as a result very useful "better than PSTN" functionality

I would suggest a explanation in the document that basically says that
Referred-By is about as trustworthy as From - no more, no less.

You meant unauthenticated in the last phrase, right?

This is an interesting point. The basic set of "bad things" that
someone could do by providing bogus Referred-By headers can be done
by providing bogus From headers. These things are only bad if something
is basing a processing decision based on the contents of the respective
headers.

Of course, there have been people arguing that using any information
in From: to make decisions without something some proof of identity
(either PKIish or trusted-3rd-party introduction-ish) is bad...

Subject: Protocol Action: DHCP Option for SIP Servers to Proposed
	 Standard
Date: Fri, 05 Apr 2002 17:51:19 -0500



The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'DHCP Option for SIP Servers'
<draft-ietf-sip-dhcp-06.txt> as a Proposed Standard.  This document
is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group.
The IESG contact persons are Allison Mankin and Scott Bradner.


Technical Summary

 The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
 protocol that can establish, modify and terminate multimedia sessions or
 calls. The SIP WG is developing its particular use for signaling of
 Internet telephony calls.  A SIP system has two components: user agents
 and servers.  The user agent is the SIP end system that acts on behalf of
 someone who wants to participate in a SIP call.

 SIP-DHCP specifies a DHCP option that allows SIP user agents (clients)
 to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for outbound SIP
 requests, the outbound proxy server.

 The SIP client obtains a DNS string via a DHCP option.  This
 string is then used by the mechanism specified by the recently
 published Proposed Standard, Locating SIP Servers, to locate
 the outbound proxy server.

 This is one of many possible solutions for locating the outbound
 SIP server.


Working Group Summary

 The SIP working group supported this proposal.  The proposal was also
 given working group last call and very carefully reviewed by the DHC
 Working Group.  Originally the DHCP and server location specifications
 were in one draft.  The IESG requested the two be separated and the
 server location draft was advanced to Proposed Standard recently.


Protocol Quality

 This document was reviewed for the IESG by Allison Mankin.  The
 DHCP usage was reviewed in tremendous detail by Thomas Narten and
 Ralph Droms, and corrections were made and Last Called to bring
 the work in line with other DHCP usage of DNS names.

I have a few questions here regarding what it means and what it is that
is desired of privacy in the relation to SIP.

Are we asking to mask the identity of the calling party or provide
confidentiality or both? I am going to stick with what appears to be the
focus so far in mind, as I read the list, which is masking the true
identity. I am still digesting SIPS. 

In this case my assumption is that the topic surrounds commincations
within a service provider environment/doamin not a private individuals
SIP UA and the world, and that we dont need to do anything between
service provider proxy and calling SIP UA, so why add an extension or
additional header at all? I am also going to refer to service provider
customers as enterprise customers just for this exampe, they could just
as easily be SOHO customers.

In the case of a service provider, if we are asking to mask the
identity, as in a private number/username that we dont want disclosed to
the called, then it seems that it would be a bit simpler to maintain
that which is curently implemented in SIP, and just develop the privacy
mechanism as a feature on the SIP proxy, transparently to the Caller
(which has been provisioned due to the desire of the Caller to be a
private entity).

For example if a SIP Proxy recieves a request from the calling SIP UA,
it should then act normally on the request, with the exception that, at
this point it must modify all SIP Headers that contain information such
as IP adresses and usernames of the caller, to <private@domain.com>,
instead of caller@domain.com, and as a key to getting responses back to
the SIP UA, the SIP Proxy must maintain the Call-ID with modified host
information if there is any in the Call-ID. 

This leaves incoming requests to the SIP UA's, calling parties which
want to call this particular SIP UA, with privacy enabled, will have to
be privvy to the SIP UA actual information. This implies that a request
from a SIP UA within a SIP provider domain are really all that need to
be gaurded by the service provider. 

Example Request:

 F1 INVITE User A -> User B

The only shady area here is the SDP portion which depending on the
environment it is assumed may or may not be a bad thing, since this
really depends on the enterprise policies at that point, and since DHCP
or a B2BUA may be implemented in many enterprise scenarios.

This sounds too simple to me but I wanted to know to what degree I am
wrong here, if I am at all. 

As for SMIME content, if this information is provided by the user it is
then the users problem, as is the case of enterprise security, and SIP
UA mis-configuration, which is easily detectable within the SIP
messages. This actually could be an value added service, detecting these
mis-configurations.  :^)

I am not convinced that Replaces by itself will completely address this
issue. Adding a Replaces header still does not explicitely convey that
the reason for the replacement is a transfer. 

The difficulty we're getting into here, is that on the one hand there is 
the REFER method with its mandatory/optional headers and on the other hand
there is the application of the REFER method. Transfer is "just" an 
example
of the latter. Anything that is specific to transfer, should probably not 
be a mandatory thing for the REFER method.

I suppose that that is correct. On my POTS telephone, transfer works like
a charm and it (the POTS phone) certainly hasn't a clue about what's going
on. However, this is more a matter of history than anything else: there
simply didn't use to be any means to convey this sort of information. 


The fact that there are applications out there, may or may not be an 
issue. 
First of all, the SIP specification is still fairly new, so how many 
applications do you expect to be adhering to the latest SIP specification 
anyway
and how many of these "fielded applications" do you expect to remain in 
existence? 
I suspect that many of the existing implementations (based on RFC2543 or 
on 
some version of the 2543bis draft) will simply disappear in the near 
future. 
In other words, it is still early days for products based on the final 
version
of RFC2543bis. Secondly, when introducing new elements in the protocol, 
what 
_is_ important is that this does not break existing implementations. 

As long as we do not specify _exactly_ what a service (transfer in this 
case) 
is supposed to deliver, this discussion will continue and go full circle 
at 
some stage.

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to explore the option of removing Referred-By a little.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As the refer-sec-options draft points out, traditional phone<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; systems don't provide the kind of information Referred-By is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to provide during a transfer. We've set our goals higher<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for SIP transfer, which is a good thing to do, but is it necessary<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a base version of the application? Would a transfer application<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that didn't tell the transfer target who initiated the transfer be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps the Referred-By functionality should be an extension<br>
&gt; &gt; (Requires:)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to REFER instead of part of its base definition?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This would remove the security issue with base REFER (B's triggered<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; request would be indistinguishable from a request that B initiated<br>
&gt; &gt; on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; its own - there is no claim in the request that the request exits<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because A asked for it to happen).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The current work on securing Referred-By would continue in an<br>
&gt; &gt; extension<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; draft, but advancement of REFER would not be blocked on its<br>

That might be an idea, but I would say that Referred-By is about the
only thing that can be used to convey some information about the "nature"
of the REFER. Furthermore, Referred-By is not specifically tied to any
application of the REFER method. If there is service specific information
to be conveyed with the REFER (e.g. for call transfer), than this is
outside the scope of the definition of the REFER method and its 
constituent headers. 
Regards,

Frank

Chris,

I am arguing that exactly the type of service you describe below will be
required to be implemented by providers of public SIP services in order to
meet Data Protection requirements.

In particular, the values in the To/From fields will need to be modified.

Others are arguing that the transport of the To/From fields without
modification is a transparent service of SIP, and that the contents of these
fields are entirely the responsibility of the calling UA i.e. the Service
Provider has no responsibility for the information in these fields.

One important point about the service you describe below is that it cannot
be implemented on a proxy. Something more that a proxy is required.

Regards...Mark

It's not about 'regulated vs non-regulated networks' - the requirements stem
from Data Protection which applies whenever a third party gets involved in
processing personal data of an individual. The involvement of regulators
comes in terms of helping industry understand how the underlying Data
Protection legislation applies to particular services, at least this is what
has happened in Europe. Your first argument in the event of a dispute would
probably be via the regulators, but not necessarily.
 
It is not you or I who would have to defend ourselves in the event of a Data
Protection dispute - it is the Service Providers. I would be interested to
hear from any Service Providers on this list whether they feel the approach
suggested by Dean below would give them enough protection from accusations
of Data Protection breaches.
 
I can't argue with your statement below - From/To get delivered unchanged to
the terminating point of the *dialog* - My contention is that to meet Data
Protection requirements, Service Providers will need to provide services
which modify From/To in the network, necessarily involving terminating the
dialog and joining it onto a new one.
 
Finally, I'll say it again, suppose we put statements in the spec now about
From/To being end-to-end transparent fields. Suppose I offer a 'subscriber
privacy' services, which strips out what it can e.g. Call-Info, Subject
etc., but leaves From/To untouched. Now almost all calls go though with
personal data of the subscriber in the From field. Are you really saying
that this would be a satisfactory 'subscriber privacy' service ? Are there
any Service providers which agree with this ?

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Do we need to spit out a new draft "SIP
Over Regulated Networks" saying "The stuff in the To and From and fields are
user-provided information which will be delivered without modification to
the termination point of the dialog"? which can the be referenced along with
bis09 by implementors of  regulated services?

Hello,

There has been some discusion about the format of the Reason header
field. Right now this header field contains, besides a SIP status code
and the reason phrase, a reason-code. This is a new code that identifies
the reason why the request was sent. 

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schulzrinne-sip-reason-01.txt

It has been proposed that we get rid of this reason code and use only
SIP status codes. I have analyzed several scenarios where the reason
header field may be useful to see if we can cover all our requirements
by using only status codes:

1) 155 responses. In this case we do not need anything besides the
status code of the final response.

2) CANCEL or BYE is sent because another branch has picked up. In this
situation a Reason header field with a 200 OK inside would do the work.

If the CANCEL or BYE have been sent because the user was tired of
waiting for the callee to answer (or hanged up in the middle of the
session), a 603 decline can be included.

This has the good property that it would work in the same way for 3pcc:

     A         Controller             B

     |              |                 |
     |              |----INV--------->|
     |              |<-200 OK SDP-----|
     |              |--ACK held------>|
     |<-----INV-----|                 |
     |-603 decline->|                 |
     |<----ACK------|                 |
     |              |-BYE Reason 603->|

In this 3pcc scenario, if A returns a 486 busy, the status code is
encapsulated in the Reason of the BYE as well.

3) BYE or CANCEL because no media was received.

We do not have a status code for this. However, we could create one,
since it may be also useful for response. For example, an application
server receives an INVITE and sends back a 183 to establish early media.
It needs to get a pin number using voive recognition. If after a while
no media has been received, the application server can respond with the
new status code 4xx No media received.

4) re-INVITE for refresh and re-INVITE to try to solve network problems.
In the first case the UAS wants to respond with the current SDP, but in
the second case the UAS might want to provide an alternative network
address, for instance. The status code defined above in 3) could be used
here.

4) When an unacceptable offer that cannot be refused (i.e, it came in
the 200 OK for a re-INVITE) is received.

  |-re-INVITE----------->|
  |<--200 OK SDP 1-------|
  |----ACK SDP 2-------->|
  |                      |
  |--BYE reason 488----->|

The SDP in the ACK is well formed, but it is useless since the SDP in
the 200 OK is unacceptable for the UAC

488 would also cover the scenario below, when a re-INVITE is refused and
the UAC does not want to continue with the session, since its re-INVITE
was refused.

  |-re-INVITE-SDP 1----->|
  |<--200 OK SDP 2-------|
  |----ACK-------------->|
  |                      |
  |--BYE reason 488----->| 



As I said in a previous mail, I believe that the reason why an initial
request (outside a dialog) has been sent is outside the scope of
"Reason". I can specify why I am sending an INVITE using the subject
header field, or the s= line of SDP (or a referred-by type of
mechanism).

So, what folks think about getting rid of the reason codes and keeping
only SIP status codes?

Best regards,

Gonzalo

The features of topology hiding, could be implemented on a separate
element to provide for the protection of the IP addresses within the
SDP, etc., but I think that it still doesn't require any additional
headers to provide this functionality.

I agree with you in respect to confidentiality and topolgy hiding (IP
modification) of the internal calling domain, but also believe that the
privacy aspect can be performed on the SIP proxy for the From Headers. I
also believe that the To headers, in relation to outbound calls
originating from the calling domain of the caller, when they relate to
the called party, outside of the calling domain, doesn't really require
modification, in my mind as long as the From has been modified to
specify that the caller is calling from a private number.

Ya, and this is where I totally agree with you, in that it must be
addressed at this level by the SIP service provider. 

The reason for this is that this is where the provisioning is performed
for customers of SIP carriers. 

Individuals can place anything they want in the From field merely by
configuring the SIP UA to do so. But in the case of a carrier much more
control and policy is required.

See my first comment on this one.

I have been working with many firewall vendors to assist them in their
development of both SIP enabled Firewall ALG's (SFA) and SIP enabled
Firewall Proxies (SFP)(These are basically outbound proxies). There are
several vendors now, which I will leave unnamed, that now support SIP
and other vendors still on the way, I will let them jump in and name
themselves if they so desire.  These vendors may very well provide the
functionality for the capabilities that you are looking for, in the very
near future. They have proven to do this job very nicely so far, and in
some instance provide additional security features that will also be
very beneficial in the SIP environment.

Chris

I would argue this is a bad thing. A referral and an unsolicited invited are
conceptually two different things. The endpoint should be aware of the
type of process it is involved in. Whether it chooses to do anything
different as a result is another question.

Sorry, I meant association at a functional or application level. It comes down
to
a question of granularity. Do you consider the referral process as one that
just
tells the referree where to go, or one that includes the point of referral?

Er, no. This is just another reference to Referred-By (no pun intended).
A->B
A<-B "please A, REFER to C"
A->C
C - "hey did A go through B before contacting me?"

I didn't think for a moment that you were! :~) You could certainly achieve
some base functionality without Referred-By, but then you could apply
the same argument to other SIP methods. You could strip out some of the
headers in INVITE and still get some base functionality, but I don't think
anyone is arguing for that. You could remove the From header for example,
as has already been alluded to on this thread. Its another point of
granularity -
you support a lot more with it than without. You can ignore the header if
your application doesn't require it (treat it like the From: header).

Hi friends,                                                           
                                                                      
I am a graduate student at NC State University. I am required to      
design the control memory and functional specifications for SIP       
protocol looking at the RFC 2543. However the RFC does not specify the
length of header fields in the URI for the request or response        
messages.I cannot design a control memory without knowing how many    
bytes each field occupies.Can anybody help me out with this?

Chris,

Regarding whether these privacy features can be provided by a proxy,
modification of the From/To fields cannot be done by a proxy according to
the current specification. You require a device which is more clever than a
proxy, as it has to maintain the link between the From/To values of the
incoming dialog and those of the outgoing dialog, performing modification in
both directions.

Otherwise it will not work with an RFC2543 client, which matches dialogs
based on the whole From/To values. If you don't care about RFC2543 clients,
then it would work, but you would still not be a proxy according to the RFC.

I am not foolish enough to mention the name for such devices, but I expect
you can guess :-)

Regarding the To field, if A calls B and B forwards to C, then B has the
right to ask their Service Provider for the forwarding to be carried out
'anonymously'. As well as precluding forwarding based on redirection, this
would imply modification of the To field, in which B's identity is carried
(amongst other things).

Regards,

Mark

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; it is that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; is desired of privacy in the relation =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are we asking to mask the identity of =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; confidentiality or both? I am going =
to stick with what</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; appears to be the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; focus so far in mind, as I read the =
list, which is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; masking the true</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; identity. I am still digesting =
SIPS.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; In this case my assumption is that =
the topic surrounds </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; commincations</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; within a service provider =
environment/doamin not a private</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; individuals</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIP UA and the world, and that we =
dont need to do anything between</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; service provider proxy and calling =
SIP UA, so why add an extension</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; additional header at all? I am also =
going to refer to service</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; provider</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; customers as enterprise customers =
just for this exampe, they</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; could just</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; as easily be SOHO customers.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of a service provider, if =
we are asking to mask the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; identity, as in a private =
number/username that we dont want</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; disclosed to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the called, then it seems that it =
would be a bit simpler </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to maintain</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; that which is curently implemented in =
SIP, and just develop</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the privacy</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanism as a feature on the SIP =
proxy, transparently to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the Caller</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; (which has been provisioned due to =
the desire of the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Caller to be a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; private entity).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; For example if a SIP Proxy recieves a =
request from the calling SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; UA,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; it should then act normally on the =
request, with the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; exception that, at</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; this point it must modify all SIP =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; information such</FONT>

That would depend on C's policy. I would expect default to be to decline.

I'm sorry, I can't see this yet. If B can contact A, in what situation would
C not be able to contact A (except in the case where suddenly A has an
equipment failure)? The only case I can see is if A is still in dialog with B
and only has "one line". Thus A would respond to B with "Busy". For this
case I would argue that if A is capable of using the REFER method it should
be prepared to deal with another request (without SDP) from the
referral point (C), e.g. VERIFY (if that comes to light). C doesn't have to
establish
media with A for verification.

Hello Juan Carlos,

I have been thinking more about your scenario, and I think that sending
back in the first answer a c=0.0.0.0 line would be the right thing to
do. 
This way, even though you have returned an answer with preconditions,
the other party will not perform resource reservation, since it does not
have an IP address to send media to.

Then, when you are ready to send an new offer, you will send it in an
UPDATE. The flow would look as follows:

                        INVITE (offer-1)
------------------------------------------------------------->
       183 (answer-to-offer-1, c=0.0.0.0)    
<-------------------------------------------------------------
                             PRACK
------------------------------------------------------------->
                             200 PRACK
<-------------------------------------------------------------
                  UPDATE (offer-2)
<-------------------------------------------------------------
            200 UPDATE (answer-to-offer-2)
------------------------------------------------------------->

        <========== Resource Reservation ==========>

Best regards,

Gonzalo

So, are you saying
"It will not be useful to have a version of REFER that doesn't
 make the triggered request distinct from an ordinary request."?

That's different from
"It will be useful to have a version of REFER that does make
the triggered request distinct from an ordinary request."

I agree with the second statement. I'm not convinced yet on the first.

Well, the same argument _did_ get applied to other SIP methods as they
were being defined. What we're left with is what we could agree on being
the minimal set of required headers. Of course, the bar was in a little
different place before we had an agreed on Supported/Require mechanism.

Your last sentence is nearing the root of the problem though.
Are you claiming that its OK to provide Referred-By and not secure it?
(where secure it means A provides a proof "X" to C through some
mechanism. X is a proof of at least A's identity, the content of the
Refer-To header A sends to B. There may be more stuff in the proof to
help defend against replay).

Are you claiming that it is sufficient to say in the draft that
an implementation receiving any request (other than a REFER) with a
Referred-By header and no such proof SHOULD ignore the header entirely
while processing the request? (This is analogous to saying an 
implementation SHOULD NOT display the contents of the From header
while the phone is alerting unless the UA has some proof of the
contents of that From header).

The problem is not with C's ability to contact A. It's C's ability to
get a SIP message to the _exact same UA_ that A is using to talk to B.
It's no good if C's request went to some other UA for A - that other UA
has no knowledge of the REFER.

We've seen this problem several times already - there have been long
threads on it in the discussions on attended transfer. In the 
cc-transfer draft, we were bringing in "accept-contact" to try to work
around it (see the far-to-sparse section titled "Consultation hold in
the presence of forking proxies in the transfer draft).

Here's a real world instance of the problem rewritten in terms of
a VERIFY.

I have 3 SIP phones active most of the day, all registering to the
same address-of-record: sip:rsparks@dynamicsoft.com. One's on my
desk, one's on my laptop, and one's in my house.

Suppose I call Kevin using my desk phone and decide I need to transfer
Kevin to you. My desk phone knows itself (at the moment) as
sip:rsparks@dhcp204.dfw.dynamicsoft.com. Say it puts that value in the
Referred-By header and passes it to Kevin. Kevin passes it to you.
You try to send a VERIFY to to that address and it fails.
Our office is set up to allow SIP traffic only through the proxies at
sip:dynamicsoft.com. Not a problem for Kevin since we got those things
on the request path using Record-Route while setting up our dialog. Big
problem for you.

So maybe I could have set my phone up to provide
sip:rsparks@dynamicsoft.com in the Referred-By instead. Then your
request would make it into our network. Now you roll the dice to see
if my desk phone is still on the list of things that it might get
forked to. If it is, you'll probably get lucky - the 200 my desk phone
returns will beat out the other phone's non-200 final responses. But all
kinds of legitimate things can happen to cause my desk phone to not be
on that list (time-of-day routing and access control lists give you
the tip of the iceberg). Let make it worse - suppose I placed my
original call to Kevin from a phone that didn't register to any
address of record at our outgoing proxies. Your request is guaranteed to
fail. (Reread this paragraph from the perspective of an INVITE that you
really wanted to reach my desk and think about what happens if someone
picks up my house phone).

Now consider environments where the endpoints live in some variant of
a private address space (nats, split-dns, etc). What kind of identifier
can they hand you that you will find useful for contacting that 
particular endpoint?

The current discussions for solving this problem involve things like
my phone including a preloaded route for you to use in the identifier I
hand to Kevin. What's not clear yet is how my phone discovers that
route.

That's fine.

155 is probably the only response to which the Reason header field
adds any value (183 was finally rejected after a few emails on the
WG list).  I really think the I-D should specify that Reason header
makes sense for 155 responses *only*.  Otherwise we will have simply
too many ways to send responses -- normal SIP response codes, Warning
header (which also carries information about the status of a response),
and now, using Reason for sending a response.

This is tying it to a specific application.  Could we not achieve the
same result by encapsulating a "400 No Media Received" into a Reason
header as follows:

    BYE sip:mediaserver.net SIP/2.0
    Reason: 400;text="No Media Received"
    ...

Come to think of it, do we need the "triggered" parameter.  If there
is not going to be a "SIP/3.0" (is there?) then why duplicate
the SIP version already present in the R-URI?

In that case, we should just mention that using the Reason header
outside of a dialog is outside the scope of this I-D (and that
Subject or some other means can be employed for that purpose).

Hi:

The thread "Reason format: removing reason codes" triggered this thought.
Why not use a Reason header to indicate that an INVITE is due to a REFER? We
could come up with a Reason code for this. That way the argument that there
is no way to tell a regular INVITE from one that has been caused by a REFER
goes away!

Thx,

Sriram

So, are you saying
"It will not be useful to have a version of REFER that doesn't
 make the triggered request distinct from an ordinary request."?

That's different from
"It will be useful to have a version of REFER that does make
the triggered request distinct from an ordinary request."

I agree with the second statement. I'm not convinced yet on the first.

Well, the same argument _did_ get applied to other SIP methods as they
were being defined. What we're left with is what we could agree on being
the minimal set of required headers. Of course, the bar was in a little
different place before we had an agreed on Supported/Require mechanism.

Your last sentence is nearing the root of the problem though.
Are you claiming that its OK to provide Referred-By and not secure it?
(where secure it means A provides a proof "X" to C through some
mechanism. X is a proof of at least A's identity, the content of the
Refer-To header A sends to B. There may be more stuff in the proof to
help defend against replay).

Are you claiming that it is sufficient to say in the draft that
an implementation receiving any request (other than a REFER) with a
Referred-By header and no such proof SHOULD ignore the header entirely
while processing the request? (This is analogous to saying an 
implementation SHOULD NOT display the contents of the From header
while the phone is alerting unless the UA has some proof of the
contents of that From header).

I think the people that want to know the INVITE was because of a REFER
are interested in more than just that one bit of information - they
are really wanting to know who sent the REFER and what that entity
actually referred to. I don't know if we could reasonably code that
into Reason:

I have been only peripherally following the "REFER security options -
removing Referred-By" thread, so aplogies if I have misunderstood the
thread discussion thus not quite answering your question.

The reason why the Reason header will not be able to do this is that
in the following scenario:

    A, B in a conversation
    A refers B to C
    B sends C an INVITE

The INVITE from B to C would be considered outside of a dialog as far
as C is concerned.

RFC2543bis09 section 8.1.2, last paragraph seems to imply that destinations
obtained through DNS look-up are tried sequentially ("trying each address
until a server is contacted") rather than in parallel. Also it refers to the
sip-srv draft, section 4.3 of which does not seem to suggest parallel
attempts. Can anyone confirm that attempts must not be tried in parallel?

It will be acting totally in acordance with the RFC except for the fact
that it must modify the outbound packets and then maintain the original
data in order to convert the responses/requests back to the original
headers that the internal SIP UA will recognize as having sent.

That is an interesting scenario, I'll need to digest this one.

I believe that we are seeking the same outcome here, so what can be done
to make it spec, do we really need additional headers, or do we rename
the "deveices" :^) .....create a privacy proxy....to go along with the
others   :^)

Thanks,
Chris

Yes, 155 is the only response that can carry a Reson header field. I
will update the draft as soon as I have the time.

well, I would say that "No Media Received" is general enough to be a
status code on its own, but your point of view is also valid. I would
like to hear more opinions.

the triggered parameter is useful if we want to encapsulate Q.850 or
other stuff like that. Anyway, that is a different discussion. Let's
first agree on the reason codes and then decide if we only carry SIP or
something else.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Integration of Resource Management and SIP
	Author(s)	: W. Marshall, G. Camarillo, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks-resource-07.txt,.ps,.pdf
	Pages		: 30
	Date		: 08-Apr-02
	
This document defines a generic framework for preconditions which is
extensible through IANA registration. This document also discusses
how network quality of service can be made a precondition to
establishment of sessions initiated by the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). These preconditions require that the participant
reserve network resources before continuing with the session. We do
not define new quality of service reservation mechanisms; these
preconditions simply require a participant to use existing resource
reservation mechanisms before beginning the session

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks-resource-07.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

Sirs,

I think there are plainty of cases where C :
-will not need to know that the call was started by A read in Referred-By
-or will trust B (i.e: intranet cases).

Protecting Referred-By also means protecting others headers.

This means that we should avoid all solutions that are not optional regarding C 
policy.

A VERIFYing approach starting at C is better suited; It allows C to decide to 
verify or not A identity.
If C does NOT want to or does NOT support VERIFY the call flows remains 
consistent with current behavior.

PS: Referred-By is a means for carrying some useful Information.

That's my 2 cents.

Best Regards,

Patrick

That contact portion (aka remote target URI) can be
updated for SUBSCRIBE created dialogs too.

THe spec does not detail error handling for the infinite different ways
in which they might occur. The choice is at the discretion of the
implementation.

Nope. This is an error in the spec. I think the right thing is to strike
the sentence entirely. The state machines are correct as defined, based
on the matching rules as defined. Determining whether a response is a
retransmission is actually hard, and not needed. Its not just the same
response code, since the same response could come from different
downstream UA. Its not a combination of response code and tags, since
the same UA could generate multiple provisional responses of the same
type (two 183, each with a different RSeq). 

Thanks for pointing this out.

I agree with what Patrick Mourot says. Let's have a basic refer capability
that provides an unsecured identity of A to C, and then leave it to C to
decide whether and how to verify the identity of A. This will depend on
whether it is attended or unattended transfer - with attended transfer the
call A-C will exist and will be identified by the Replaces header. This may
be sufficient, but if not, verification can be done in the context of that
dialog A-C.

Sirs,

I think there are plainty of cases where C :
-will not need to know that the call was started by A read in Referred-By
-or will trust B (i.e: intranet cases).

Protecting Referred-By also means protecting others headers.

This means that we should avoid all solutions that are not optional
regarding C 
policy.

A VERIFYing approach starting at C is better suited; It allows C to decide
to 
verify or not A identity.
If C does NOT want to or does NOT support VERIFY the call flows remains 
consistent with current behavior.

PS: Referred-By is a means for carrying some useful Information.

That's my 2 cents.

Best Regards,

Patrick

Dear Chris and Mark,

regarding your discussion on privacy the privacy draft I have some =
comments:

1. From the Service Provider Point of view the mechanisms described =
within the privacy draft are needed. It is important to have a =
statement from the caller if he wants to hide his identity by the =
callee. There are many call scenarios where I would like to see this =
kind of privacy including the case of the interworking with a PSTN =
network, because there it is needed to have the clear statement if the =
call needs privacy or not.

2. For regulation, billing and other purposes the service provider =
needs an indication if the address included in the Invite is trusted or =
untrusted (screen =3D Yes/No). I know Chris does not like overregulated =
networks, but I think we need this within the SIP domain and in the =
PSTN interwoking case.=20

3. I don't know if a "privacy proxy" will solve all problems concerning =
privacy and trusted addresses/entities. I support the proposal of the =
privacy draft concerning the trust relations and the additional =
headers.

Of course the interworking with PSTN networks is not the only =
application (and of course not the most important) of the privacy =
draft. But for the Service Provider, which will have hybrid networks =
(e.g. SIP and PSTN), the privacy draft gives the tool to solve many =
problems at the network boundary.

> 1. From the Service Provider Point of view the mechanisms described within the privacy draft are needed. It is important to have a statement from the caller if he wants to hide his identity by the callee. There are many call scenarios where I would like to see this kind of privacy including the case of the interworking with a PSTN network, because there it is needed to have the clear statement if the call needs privacy or not.

Actually I do believe that the mechanisms are required and fully support
the direction of the privacy draft. I guess what I am looking for is a
method to reduce the number of mechanisms within the protocol. Right now
I am focusing on the mechanism that basically conveys the identity of
the caller to the remote party as "private".  In the case of a service
provider or even a SIP UA for that matter, I dont see the need to place
the mechanism in the protocol, when it seems that all we need is a local
mechanism on the SIP UA itself or a provisioning option on the SIP UAS
to modify the From to "private". I am just wondering if every aspect of
SIP communications needs to be conveyed by a SIP message.

>

I know Chris does not like overregulated networks, but I think we need this within the SIP domain and in the PSTN interwoking case.
> 

I never said that I was against unregulated networks, they are and will
be a reality. I actually have been concerned that the regulation aspect
is being ignored, by the very fact that everyone looks at firewalls as
an evil in an IP network. It may be firewalls, SIP enabled, that provide
portions fo calling confidentiality, topology hiding, etc., and I
believe that these will aid in meeting future regulations.

Was just kidding about privacy proxy. 

Would just like to look into the need of additional headers. As for
trust relations in a carrier network...this may be a matter of
provisioning on SIP UAS.

> Of course the interworking with PSTN networks is not the only application (and of course not the most important) of the privacy draft. But for the Service Provider, which will have hybrid networks (e.g. SIP and PSTN), the privacy draft gives the tool to solve many problems at the network boundary.

Totally agree. This is a tool not only addressing future reguations at
the carrier level, but also at the enterprise boundaries.

Thanks for the excellent feedback, 
Chris

Hi,

Bis 09 section 17.1.1.2 does not include timer for proceeding state.
The protocol also says one SHOULD NOT retransmit in proceeding state.
Should we need a timer or is it application decision ?

Thanks,

Hi Amihay,
     The client transaction does start timer C
when sending the INVITE request. This timer is
reset on receiving any provisional response. On
timeout, the client transaction moves to Terminated
state.

     In bis-05, this was described in Section 17,
and also indicated in the "INVITE client transaction"
diagram. But in bis--9, this description has been moved
to Sec 16.6, bullet 11. As an aside, it seems to have been
missed out in the INVITE client transaction diagram....

Timer C is for proxies.
In a UAC, if you want to wait forever in the proceeding state you are free
to do so. This is application specific.

Hi Amihay,
     The client transaction does start timer C
when sending the INVITE request. This timer is
reset on receiving any provisional response. On
timeout, the client transaction moves to Terminated
state.

     In bis-05, this was described in Section 17,
and also indicated in the "INVITE client transaction"
diagram. But in bis--9, this description has been moved
to Sec 16.6, bullet 11. As an aside, it seems to have been
missed out in the INVITE client transaction diagram....

Subject:  [Sip] Question: Timer for Proceeding




Hi,

Bis 09 section 17.1.1.2 does not include timer for proceeding state.
The protocol also says one SHOULD NOT retransmit in proceeding state.
Should we need a timer or is it application decision ?

Thanks,

Hi,

Terminating early dialog is allowed with BYE or CANCEL.
What is the best / recommended way ?
Case BYE, is it correct that we eliminate the use of ACK ?

Hi,

Based on the sip-events draft, it seems that a subscription is only
defined/established within the context of a dialog. Is this correct? Is it
possible to have a subscription on a user/resource level outside a dialog
as long as route and contact  information of the subscriber is provisioned
for the subscription?

Thanks,
YoungSun

Hi,

I read the sip-event-05 I-D as saying a subscription can create a dialog.
Also, that a subscription can exist within an established dialog.  And that
a dialog established by an INVITE transaction that also has an associated
subscription won't terminate until both the INVITE established session *and*
SUBSCRIBE established subscription have both been terminated.

An example of a non-INVITE established dialog is a phone subscribing to
message-waiting indications from a voice-mail server.

Regards,
Bert

Short forms are still allowed, but restricted to one character. THe idea
is that they are allocated to headers used frequently. It may all be
moot with compression, but I agree with Anders not to use a long name if
we can avoid it.

There is a major difference in handling right now. In the Path draft,
the proxy adds its URI as the BOTTOM-MOST entry in the Route header, and
the registrar inverts it before using. WIth record-route, its added as
the topmost entry. I would personally prefer to keep things consistent,
and have proxies add new values at the top. This also avoids the need to
invert them at the registrar.

Off to "real work" for a week or two, and its amazing the length of some
threads that amass whilst I am not actively reading the list... anyway,
my comments inline.

I agree with Jon that this is a reasonable approach. I had suggested the
same to some 3g folks in the past, to deal with the more generic
problem, which was that the user signed up for privacy services, but
"forgets" to put anonymous in the from field.

IMHO, the notion of a network provided anonymous forwarding service is
primarily an artifact of the PSTN, where the locations of identity
information were easy to spot and remove. In an IP network, with a
protocol like SIP, you are kidding yourself if you think To/From is
sufficient to "cleanse". Identity information could be lurking in
headers both known and unknown. Some examples:

Subject: Hey, Bob, lets go for lunch
NewHeader: Bob once again
Call-Info: http://foo.com/picture-of-bob-and-me.jpg

and let us not forget the SDP too...

The only way in SIP to offer a useful (meaning, would actually work
reliably from the subscribers perspective) anonymous forwarding service
is to use a B2BUA "with a vengeance". This B2BUA would not propagate ANY
information from the original request, stripping everything, and
reformulating the mandatory headers on its own. It would probably need
to act as a media intermediary too. I would argue that, if you want an
anonymous forwarding service to be network provided, you really DONT
want a proxy in any sense of the word. THis would destroy services, of
course, but thats the penalty for this feature.

Arguing that only the To field needs to be stripped, because that is the
only thing the sip spec defines as identity, will hardly be comforting
to a user that depends on the proper functioning of this service.

IMHO, it would be more proper to reject the request outright, with some
kind of new status code indicating that the called party wishes to
forward the call anonymously. However, the problem remains that B now
has to trust A to properly strip all identifying information, not jus
the To field - a risky proposition. Effectively, B needs to ask A to
perform the same functions that B2BUA above provides....

Thanks for the summary. It is well needed. I suspect much of the lack of
comment derives from the difficulty in following this long thread.

I would kindly request all participants to please keep the discussions
technical. A lot of the emails in this thread were personal attacks.
Many more were threats along the general line of "do X or standards body
Y will do Z". I really hate the latter ones. Let us hear no more of
either type of nonsense. It is not the IETF way.

It was never our intent for Call-Info to provide any form of network
asserted identity that could be used in any useful way. Generally, the
idea was that insertion of Call-Info was either done by the UA, or in
the case of proxy-inserted values, was for "opt-in" services were the
user had signed up for content to be added. That said, there are
certainly cases where the caller may opt in for this service but require
privacy for a particular call, and we need a mechanism to support that.

However, in no way would I support or advocate the use of Call-Info as
an alternative for R-P-ID.

I think that the proper way to handle this, as pursued in other threads,
is to provide a sane alternative to 3gpp so that they don't do this. I
believe we all agreed it would be bad.

IMHO, 'untrusted RPID' is identical to the From, except that it is
purportedly inserted by a network element, whereas From is purportedly
inserted by the end user. Neither provides any guarantees. The essence
of the debate, I think, is whether you believe there is value to the end
user in a field which is the identity purportedly inserted by some
network element.  Since there is apparently value to the identity
purportedly inserted by the end user, I see no reason why we should
discriminate.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: DHCPv6 Options for SIP Servers
	Author(s)	: H. Schulzrinne, B. Volz
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-dhcpv6-00.txt
	Pages		: 7
	Date		: 10-Apr-02
	
This document defines a DHCPv6 option that contains a list of domain
names or IPv6 addresses that can be mapped to one or more SIP
outbound proxy servers. This is one of the many methods that a SIP
client can use to obtain the addresses of such a local SIP server.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-dhcpv6-00.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-dhcpv6-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-dhcpv6-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

In principle this would work for 3GPP, if the 'xxx Privacy Required'
response were defined, because 3GPP can place new requirements on the SIP
clients in 3GPP networks. But it's no good for people wanting to use RFC2543
clients & in practice probably too late for 3GPP.

Also, the requirement for subscriber privacy could be based on some complex
algorithm in the outgoing proxy (e.g. based on call destination), so the UA
cannot expect to 'learn' when it should include its identity and when not.
This could lead to a large percentage of calls having try without privacy
and then try again. This would not be acceptable over a wireless link.

I'm not arguing that To/From are the only things you would need to modify -
it's just that To/From are the problematic ones because of the link to
dialog matching in RFC2543 clients. Other things are easy (well, easier) to
modify.

You can imagine a whole continuum of 'anonymity' services providing various
levels of anonymity traded off against service transparency. For example, IP
address privacy may not be required in all cases, especially with IPv6
privacy addresses.

I don't know where on this continuum you would have to be to meet the
obligation to provide an anonymous forwarding service, but I'm arguing that
even the simplest such service cannot be provided by a straightforward SIP
proxy.

Any such service would *at least* have to modify From/To. Others seemed to
be saying that since these fields were entirely a matter for the UA, then
the network has no responsibility for their contents and would never need to
modify them.

As to whether 'anonymous forwarding' would be required to be provided by
Public Service Providers or not, it's a matter of legal interpretation of
the Data Protection legislation. We can't say whether it is, or whether it
is not, although we each may have opinions.

For my part, I can't see why this requirement would not apply to Public
Telcomminications Service Providers independent of the technology they use
to offer service. Therefore I think there is *at least* a significant
*chance* that SPs will have to provide such services, and so it's important
that we understand how they might do that.

For the privacy aspect I believe that it can be provided at least for
anonymity in the To or From, by a standard proxy, but as Johnathan
stated a B2BUA would be required to provide the topology (IP address)
hiding at all other levels, and then it would also be required to
provide the same actions for media. As for the example of content, 

> > Subject: Hey, Bob, lets go for lunch

I dont think that these fall under the same category as far as identity
is concerned, since they are not headers asserting identity, merely
topics or objects within a conversation. To me identity would be
something more tangible than that, such as the content of a From, Via,
Route, etc., or even IP addressing...but then again if UA's are behind a
B2BUA even IP addressing is less of an identifier of the originator. 

Does this seem like a correct assumption?

I believe that, since we have been discussing this in terms of privacy
as it relates to an SP environment, the responsibility lies with the SP.
A UA not within an SP realm can assert that they are anyone they want to
be including anonymous, right? In an authenticated SP environment the
option for a UA to muck with identity would not be permitted becuase it
wouldnt authenticate correctly/at all, would it?

Just on this one issue of obfuscation of the From/To field....

Let's be really clear about why this has come about:

Some Service Providers *believe* in the following proposition:

(*) IF the UA is allowed to put identity information into From/To, THEN the
Service Provider will be forced (by Data Protection) to provide services
which modify these fields, in order to protect the privacy of people other
than the actual calling user - subscriber, forwarding etc.

First, set aside the question of whether to agree with (*) or not.

There are three options for people with this belief:
1) *Require* permanantly that the UA does not put identity information into
From/To
2) Reject requests where the UA puts identity information in From/To if
privacy is required
3) Build network services which provide the necessary modification
(+whatever else is needed)

I do not think there are any other options.

We all agree that (1) is bad. (2) looks attractive but is not backwards
compatible, requires a double request (not good for wireless) & has issues
as to whether you trust the UA (in redirection scenarios).

I was looking for a consensus that (3) is a possible and valid thing to do
for these Service Providers. If the IETF SIP group agree that (3) and not
(1) is _a_ valid solution to this problem, then there is more chance of
other fora adopting (3) instead of (1).

So far, people have been arguing against the belief (*). The question is not
whether (*) is demonstrably true but whether there is sufficient *chance* of
it being true to justify serious consideration. A significant group of
Service Providers obviously think it is - they are worried they will be in
this situation and want a solution defined - that should be enough for us to
discuss solutions.

So, can we agree to recommend at least that people with belief (*) adopt
solution (3) and not solution (1) ?

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Jon is concerned that 'untrusted RPID' =
provides a standardised</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; alternative to From/To, allowing Bad =
Things, like never </FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I think that the proper way to handle this, as =
pursued in </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; other threads,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; is to provide a sane alternative to 3gpp so =
that they don't do this. I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; believe we all agreed it would be bad.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Others have pointed out that the draft =
explicitly states </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that untrusted</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; UAs MUST NOT add RPID. However the draft =
explicitly described proxy</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; handling of RPID headers from untrusted =
sources (proxies OR </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; UAs), and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; allows these to be propogated, marked as =
untrusted.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Therefore, a UA which DID add RPID, =
although non-compliant </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to the draft,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; would have its RPID propogated through the =
network.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 3) 'Untrustworthy RPID'</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Flemming, Bill et al argued that RPID =
information is still </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; useful when</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; it is 'untrustworthy'. This can occur =
legitimately within </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the draft when</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an RPID which is not 'private' (and so not =
encrypted) </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; crosses a trust</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; boundary. This would represent an identity =
asserted by Network A and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; passed to Network B, when B has no =
explicit trust </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; relationship with A.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; The contention was that since this =
information still has </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; some value, it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; should be passed to the UAS for display, =
and might also have some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; application for call trace, although =
obviously not as useful as a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 'trustworthy' identity.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Jon argued that the From field provides =
well enough for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; display, and the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; value of untrustworthy information for =
call trace is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; debatable (and has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; been debated at length).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; IMHO, 'untrusted RPID' is identical to the =
From, except that it is</FONT>

whereas From is purportedly</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; inserted by the end user. Neither provides any =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of the debate, I think, is whether you believe =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; user in a field which is the identity =

If you want to be compatible with RFC2543 clients, then if you muck with
From/To, you need to change them back in responses. This is not something
which a proxy, as defined in the RFC, would do. That's not to say you
couldn't build a device which looked remarkably *like* a proxy in all
respects apart from this. You might even call it a proxy, but in pedantic
specification terms that would not be correct.

As I understand it, From is not used for authentication. A proxy which
authenticates someone uses different fields and is not required then to
check that the From field is 'correct' for the authenticated user. Of course
you *could* do that and it just might be a feature that a Service Provider
would want.

Nevertheless, I would argue that in practice the SP still has some
responsibility for this field, on the grounds that a 'subscriber privacy
service' which did not modify this field would not be regarded as actually
working by the subscriber.

So how about we just name it RRR?

This has been pointed out to me several times, and will be fixed in next
draft rev.

---------------
Some Service Providers *believe* in the following proposition: 

(*) IF the UA is allowed to put identity information into From/To, THEN
the Service Provider will be forced (by Data Protection) to provide
services which modify these fields, in order to protect the privacy of
people other than the actual calling user - subscriber, forwarding etc.

First, set aside the question of whether to agree with (*) or not. 
There are three options for people with this belief: 

1) *Require* permanantly that the UA does not put identity information
into From/To 
2) Reject requests where the UA puts identity information in From/To if
privacy is required 
3) Build network services which provide the necessary modification
(+whatever else is needed) 
I do not think there are any other options.  
----------------

Just to be a "devils advocate",  I suggest other alternatives:

4) Require that the UA anonymize the To and From headers IF requesting
CLIR on a call, and allow them to populate those headers as desired when
NOT requesting CLIR.

And the "modest suggestion" alternative:

5) Use a non-Internet protocol which completely constrains the service
functionality and user experience to a least common denominator and stop
pretending that your requirements have anything to do with the Internet.


Look, there are two reasons why we may want to use Internet protocols:

1) Because Internet protocols and approaches offer a substantially
richer, more flexible alternative which provides compelling advantages
in terms of service delivery options relative to traditional PSTN
approaches.

2) Because we're jealous of the success the Internet has had and want to
contaminate it with "telco like" requirements so that Internet people
can be miserable too.

I don't know about you, but I believe in #1, and would argue that if we
accept (*) as a requirement, that we're leading down the slippery slope
towards #2, leading to what will be a large push from certain segments
(witness Path discussion) to adopt alternative #5. Alternative #4 is a
reasonable compromise which keeps the responsibility were the Internet
says the responsibility should be, in the hands of the user.

Perhaps instead of To: and From: we should have called these headers
"What-I-will-Call-You:" and "What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me:". These headers
have ABSOLUTELY NO SEMANTIC VALUE at the signaling and routing level.
They are HUMAN SUPPLIED values intended for HUMAN CONSUMPTION. There are
many other human-supplied values possible in the signaling, and the risk
of privacy violation is equally present on ALL of them.

If we earnestly believe that Data Protection is going to require that
we, by policy, alter these human-supplied/human-consumed values, then
we're logically going to have to do the same for every other
human-supplied/human-consumed values. I would argue that this completely
defeats the value of an Internet protocol in this context.

I believe it is significantly more effective to provide guidelines on
human-supplied/human consumed values, and implement hard requirements
for data protection only on network-supplied values.

Right and this course would be required between client and proxy if this
function were implemented. I agree with you just trying to see if there
were a simple way to do this task.

This is true, maybe a B2BUA could have the anonamizer feature and work
within the policy of the SP realm, since a B2BUA may already performing
additional functions similiar to this. Of course then the proxy will
need to forward outbound requests through the B2BUA.

Ya, I just remembered its in the proxy-auth/auth headers that the
username/pw comes in to play for authentication...

A few days I polled the list about opinions on adopting the Reason
header as a WG effort.

The comments I received seem to be unamimously favorable, so I would say
we have a consensus.

This seems to be covered in the callcontrol charter task, so I suspect
we just need a milestone added.

Suggestions?

Please comment ASAP -- I've been lax in getting these circulated.
Finals are due tomorrow.

Revisions will be posted at:

as they are made.

---------------------------------

Minutes edited by Dean Willis from notes taken by Vijay Gurbani, 
Joerg Ott, and Renee Cohen.

Session 1
	
19:30 CST meeting started 
     Agenda accepted 
     Chairs discuss "Note Well" 2026 notice
	

Work Plan update:

     We have revised the SIP spec; went to IESG; resulted in a "Yea"
     from IESG. SIP events spec is done

     Session timer is back to haunt us -- goes back to authors for bis
     update.

     Caller pref - pending from author for bis. 

     Precondition extensions -- in WGLC now; in IESG by April SIP 

     Privacy spec from DCS in WGLC now, IESG by April 

     REFER Method; needs bis, security updates. IESG by May? No
     complaints from authors. More important since there are many
     implementations already.

     MESSAGE method ready for WG LC -- have not done it yet. 

     PATH method needs rev from editor. Call for volunteers. 

     NAT awareness: rev pending from author. 

     SIP Privacy and Security reqs to IESG? There is a feeling that
     the SIP extensions for privacy wrt to 3GPP is not achievable --
     Jon P: some privacy (user provided privacy vs. network provided
     privacy) nuances have not been captured as of today. Henning:
     that would make a lot of sense if we know what we wanted --
     another req document is not in and of itself useful. Dean: SIP
     privacy and security reqs predate the SIPPING WG -- IESG felt
     that it is such a critical piece that it should stay in SIP WG.

     SIP over SCTP? Gonzalo: we are ready for WG LC for
     SIP/SCTP. Dean: Also in July timeframe -- have a draft standard
     version of SIP -- #1 goal in July of 2003. Original SIP spec was
     2543, we want to claim new number of 3543 :-)

     State: Charter item of pushing certain things off the SIP
     signaling state -- state or cookies specification translated to
     SIP. Did we ever come to a consensus on how to go forward? Rohan:
     Cookies I-D is good for doing what you want to do with the state
     I-D and is more general. I support it. Dean: Anyone know of
     implementations? [No implementations yet] Jonathan Rosenberg: The
     reason no one has implemented it is because everyone is using R-R
     and Contact. It is not entirely clear to me that this is even
     needed. Flemming: The difference is that R-R requires the proxy to
     be in all signaling. Andrew Zmolek: We looked at R-R issue and it
     seemed that we were going to have some trouble -- either the
     state or the cookies would do fine JDR: R-R was not sufficient
     since there was no reliable way to put something and get it
     back. With the new R-R update, this is no longer an
     issue. rjsparks: You cannot change the state in a dialog, you can
     only push and get the state. JDR: Okay, if that is the
     requirement, then fine -- if the req is to just push state for
     the purpose of a dialog, we have a mechanism already in R-R,
     Contact. Brian Rosen: we may work on a requirement document
     offline, assuming that it is useful.

     General Scheduling: Henning: meta scheduling aspect -- can you
     get people involved long enough to remember what the issue was?
     Brian: Our goal is to get a lot of stuff out that has been
     hanging around for a long time -- but we do not want to get out
     12 LC I-Ds at the same time. We will revive the LC schedule we
     had going. Henning: Do other I-Ds that are not on your list wait
     until re- chartering? Brian: No. There are some things that are
     hanging around for a long time; as long as the ADs do not breath
     down on us, we will work on them as we go along. Henning: Need a
     priority list. Jonathan: Learn from successes -- Bundle 1 was a
     success delivery to 3GPP. With the current mechanism we were
     randomly LC'ing. One of the thing the Bundle did is to focus
     people's energy on that. Brian: We can consider that; Bundle 1's
     advantage was that the drafts were related to one another. These
     do not.

     What do we do with: sipping-conferencing-models? sip-3pcc?
     app-components? sip-vxml? Jonathan: need to finish bis update;
     but done as far as I know.  Rohan: 3PCC is a very pure usage
     draft describing the usage of baseline bis offer answer
     model. Most of the stuff above is usage or framework, we should
     get it done in SIPPING. Brian Rosen: You are basically saying
     what Jonathan said: Put it in Bundles. Rohan: Sure.
 

SIP Change process, Allison Mankin:

     This is not a SIP draft; it is an individual transport area
     draft. People have said that there is a need to control SIP
     information. The Replaces header was done in a freeform manner --
     this is not good. WG discipline needed over extensions of
     SIP. RFC 3261 (new bis) has an IANA consideration which is very
     different then what you have seen before. You need a standards
     track RFC for headers, method, response codes, warning codes. One
     place you do not need to do this is for the Events RFC -- just
     need WG yes for these. serverfeatures did not go too far with
     IESG since it offered unbridled extensions. We now have P-header
     (not X-header, more constrained). Still need a RFC, but you do
     not have to have the buy in of SIPPING or SIP. The string with P-
     is reserved if they are to have a future life. Henning: while I
     agree with the notion, the naming has the same problems that X
     headers had. Attaching a meaning to "P-" is not good. Allison:
     They do not have option tags and have to have applicability
     statements. Henning: There are 2 issues: naming and
     process/applicability. If we have a header name which was
     registered (say, foo); that header has the property that as long
     as it is in the non-RFC track, it looks like a normal header. If
     it reaches standards track, it retains its name. Lets say P-bar
     header becomes popular and widely implemented. Now, if P-bar
     header goes to standards track, they will have to rename this
     header. Allison: can you make a P-header a standards track header
     -- add an option tag. Dean: The P- name will still be registered
     and be useful. Now you will basically have to track P- and non-P
     extension headers -- makes the symbol table little large --
     that's okay. Dave Oran: feel uncomfortable in mixing naming
     conventions and algorithmic behavior. I do not like the idea of
     having to parse inside header string. Jonathan Rosenberg: The
     name of the option tag is unrelated to the name of the
     header. Henning: HTTP extension model is different then SIP
     extension model. There is no correlation in header names and
     option tags. Allison: If the I-D has any implications of this
     sort, we can fix it. Gonzalo: We have option tags that have no
     headers associated with them. Keith Drage: We need to make sure
     that this I-D does not contain any requirements on SIP
     implementation -- a SIP implementer must not have to read this
     I-D.

 

The UPDATE method - Jonathan Rosenberg :

     Open issues 

     1) Glare with PRACK - UPDATE only specifies glare resolution with
        itself. You can have glare with PRACK. Rejecting PRACK is
        bad. Solution: can't send UPDATE if you have sent an answer in
        18x for which you have not gotten a PRACK. Will put some words
        with general caveats.
    
     2) Repairable response codes -- automata can fix these without
        human intervention. What about 493 Undecipherable? May require
        user intervention to fix it. Proposal: include it, add text
        saying it retries if it would otherwise retry with that
        response. [No one objected].

     3) Generate 155 instead of 4xx MAY or SHOULD -- for backward
        compatibility. SHOULD is better if the UAS supports this
        capability, the proxy may not. This makes it work at proxies
        transparently. Comment: This text is screaming for a reason
        header, otherwise the UAC will have to infer what the problem
        is. JDR: I did not talk about reason header for a reason -- it
        is on a slower track. For the basic cases we are worried about
        immediately, the UAC can infer from the headers. Going
        forward, the reason header is the way to go. Gonzalo: The last
        review of the reason header already has this, so we can use
        it. Jonathan: Does the group agree that the message sip (or
        sip frag) is the appropriate approach? Or wait for the reason
        header (which is on a slower track). Rohan: Can we pull out
        155 out of this, then? [No consensus on this]

 

Manyfolks open issues (Gonzalo Camarillo)
draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks...-05.txt 

     We are now defining a framework for preconditions of different
     types. We define the current status of the precond vs. desired
     status. We always know if current status is better or worse then
     desired status. Two status types: e2e -- always present in
     manyfolks (-04). Segmented status type introduced in -04.

     Open issues: Meaning of Require: precondition -- 2 approaches: I
     refuse everything I don't understand. Or be liberal and accept
     the offer if the preconditions can be met without your
     intervention? Which is better? 1 or 2? Comment: you can have a
     thing called "criticality" which gives a hint on what to
     do. Gonzalo: I will decide after speaking to Mark.

 

Reason code, Gonzalo Camarillo.:

     Requirements: same functionality needed in several WG items --
     why is this request (or response) being sent?

     Useful in many works: ISUP/SIP mapping, in manyfolks
     (precondition failure, unacceptable here), HERFP, 3pcc.

     Jonathan: Throw in another use: in the event that you fork the
     request to a bunch of phones and one of them picks up. The proxy
     generates CANCEL. The reason for CANCEL is not because the user
     hung up, but because 1 of N answered.

     Rohan: Lot of overlap in the reqs that generated this document
     and request history.

     Eric Burger: This is H.450 all over again.

     Jonathan R: Don't we have an enumerated list of response code in
     the bis already? This is exactly that, and then some.

     Comment: we have one address space for responses, and we have
     just added one more with the Reason header. Has a kitchen-sink
     feeling to it.

     Henning: The motivation was exactly to prevent reinventing the
     same thing every time. We are not adding new error classes that
     will have to be percolated to all existing implementation. This
     is a fine grained status code which is there if you need
     it. Example: Q.850 error code will not be pertinent to many
     implementations, but to the one that it is pertinent to, it can
     use it without too much perturbation.

     Brian Rosen: What do we do now? 2 possibilities: crisp set of
     reqs, which are clear and this is a reasonable solution. Or we do
     not have a crisp set of reqs. We need to determine this
     first. Lot of discussion on if this does or does not solve the
     job. But do we know what the job is? Should we push this back
     into sipping and generate a req document? Those who think we have
     a sensible set of reqs and we can move forward? Those who need
     more reqs? [The hum level was 50-50, no consensus by humming on
     if we have the reqs captured right.]

     Dave Oran: Need hum on slightly different -- do we get involved
     in reqs that requires identity (being able to communicate why you
     are sending it to this particular party).

     Brian Rosen: That is a reasonable suggestion -- so considered. We
     will get the reqs out before Yokohama and bring the solution out
     before then. Those of you who hummed against it should
     participate in the list when we discuss this on it.

 

 

Flemming Andreasen, SIP Extensions for Media Authorization.
draft-ietf-sip-call-auth-04.txt :

     Changes: Category is informational -- Header is now
     P-Media-Authorization. Applicability statement about appropriate
     use (SIP Proxy and Policy Server (PDP) must belong to the same
     domain) Updated rules about when to add a P-Media-Authorization
     header. Additional security considerations -- don't encrypt
     message bodies (proxies need to examine them).

     Open issues: None known (authors list need to be trimmed),
     currently in WGLC.

     Jonathan: I will send you some minor reviews. More look-see
     needed in the security section. This token is about media
     authorization -- authorization follows authentication. DOes the
     I-D point out this issue?

     Flemming: You do not necessarily need to authenticate before
     authorization. Some entity has been given an authorization token
     to access some resource.

     Jonathan: More discussion maybe needed on the security section --
     you are giving a token to a party that you may not have
     authenticated. If that is your model, fine; a couple of sentences
     would probably suffice in the I-D.

     Brian Rosen: The WGLC is going to get over, if anyone wants to
     raise more issues please do so. It fills the needs, even though
     it has a lot of limits. LC be it, we will move forward.

 

 

Ben Campbell, SIP Extensions for IM :

     -05 draft; recent changes -- remove CPIM mapping to separate
     draft. Would like to include in 3rd bundle to IESG.

     Highlights - sends IM; does not initiate a dialog, does not
     discuss message sessions; actual message in bodies.

     Open issues: No recent discussions. Needs minor editorial changes
     (forking, threading -- couple of sentences). Anything else? Is it
     ready for LC? One more revision -- no change in substance, more
     editorial.

     Brian Rosen: Ok, as soon as you have the revision, we will post
     it as LC.

     
Closing Remarks :

     Brian Rosen: Administering this list is no fun -- people forward
     their email to accounts that consistently run over quota. The
     list is setup so that only subscribers can post.

21:29 CST - WG adjourned. 



SIP Session 2, 53rd IETF 

Start 13:06 CST 

      Added AKA Digest and Path discussion to the Agenda. 
      Agenda accepted. 

Digest based authentication -- James Undery, Ubiquity 

      Quick run through of improvements to Digest
      authentication. UAC->UAS auth, UAC->Proxy authentication
      supported in the SIP spec. Our draft adds Proxy->UAS auth.,
      bid-down protection, mutual auth., integrity. Added 3 new
      headers and 1 new response (492) for Proxy->UAS authentication
      Bid-down protection: prefix added to nonces, protects scheme and
      quality of detection.

      Open issues: 1) No algorithm protection - if a hashing algo is
      broken, we need algo revocation. Proposal: make limitation
      explicit and rule that algo revocation is out of scope. 2) No
      negotiation of body integrity protection -- Proxies can't alter
      message bodies; Proposal : leave unchanged 3) No protection
      against weak passwords: Proposal - make limitation explicit, the
      solution is out of scope. 4) Client side can't initiate
      authentication 5) Forking and response collation issues - can't
      guarantee upstream entities see the challenges; response
      collation oriented towards success. Proposal: make limitations
      explicit.

      Jon: What are you trying to accomplish as a UAS by
      authenticating your upstream proxy? James: You may trust the
      proxy but not the link between the proxy and the UAS (for
      example: a radio interface). Jon: So this is the integrity
      process, not an authentication one. James: Authentication and
      integrity are closely linked. Rohan: We need to think about if
      this is needed? Looks like it is solved by TLS anyway. We need
      to understand under what circumstances we will use this
      approach. Jonathan: With this you do not know which proxy -- one
      up or 2 up -- you want to authenticate.

      Comment: You mention weak passwords; there are no strong
      passwords. You are unlikely to create a password that is not
      uncrackable, regardless of them appearing in the dictionary or
      not. Relying on a long random key is of no help. Christian: I
      would like to reinforce this point. Digest should be combined
      with strong authentication of the server, not on its
      own. Henning: when people talk about passwords, I wouldn't think
      that this is human generated; it is random string generated by
      some automata.

      Dean: Are we going to close any of these today? If not, let's
      take this to the mailing list. Brian: This has been hanging on
      for a long time; are we going to extend digest or not fortify it
      anymore. I do not know how to go ahed. People are saying that
      digest is terrible, but others are saying that it is still
      useful. I do not see other alternatives on the floor. Christian:
      2 forms with digest: 1 is if you are sending it as cleartext. 2
      is when you are doing digest with a 3rd party you have not
      authenticated. Simple thing for us is to use digest only for
      REGISTER not anything else. Brian: But there is no other
      solution on the table. Allison: The security review for bis came
      out as digest being a very lightweight way to do user
      authentication is okay. There is a good possibility of taking
      some time over this and making it better; maybe we should say
      that this document is not a WG document. We should discuss for
      the charter document something that exploits S/MIME. Rohan:
      There is some stuff in James' draft we can get consensus
      quickly; others may take some time. Allison: There is a huge
      deployment of digest. MD5 digest is known weak, but is not going
      to be thrown out. The topic we have now is not extending digest,
      but supporting some other password (a la AKA). For this
      document, consider what requirements it is meeting? Henning: One
      thing desperately needed in digest is registrar
      authentication. If we do something with digest at all, it must
      be this. Authenticating previous hops is nice, but not a known
      vulnerability we need solve now. Steven (3GPP): We do have a
      basic need to protect last hop integrity. We need to know what
      the intentions of the WG are towards digest. We need the
      direction very soon otherwise we are in a bind. Allison: Maybe,
      as Steven said, IPSec could be used for the short duration --
      could be the right way of meeting the requirement. Maybe we can
      have 5 minutes on some other agenda to talk about this. Brian:
      We are not getting anywhere -- let's move on and take it to
      list.


Digest AKA Authentication - Aki Nieme 

      AKA is a shared secret based auth that uses a smart card like
      device. Previous proposal (...-eap-01.txt) got good reception at
      SLC.

      Digest AKA reuses the digest scheme and uses the AKA parameters
      as input to the digest mechanism. AKA generates "one-time"
      passwords for Digest.

      Issues: 1) "Choke point" attack - similar to the weak password
      attack. 2) Should we adopt draf-niemi-sipping-digest-aka-00? It
      provides message integrity and is complementary to vanilla
      digest used today.

      Future: Will this become a work item for SIP WG? RFC category?
      There is some time pressure since 3GPP R5 is coming up. Can
      draft-niemi-digest-aka-00.txt be adopted as a solution?

      Allison: This does not involve any SIP extensions; just the
      extension of HTTP methods. It is good to get the SIP people's
      knowledge. There is no need for it to be a WG document; you can
      take it to RFC as an individual submission. Brian: Is there
      sufficient interest in the group to make it a WG item, or
      continue as an individual submission? [Took hum; the hum for
      people who want to make it a WG document prevailed]. Miguel
      Garcia: why use a 3G specific technology which has no broad
      impact on the Internet? Adam seconded. [The chairs agreed that
      we may have to revisit this issue again]


Security Negotiation open issues, Jari Akko 

     Presented issues, asked what to do next. Brian: Anyone object to
     NOT go forward with this? [No one objected; this is part of SIP
     WG]

SIP Extensions for Network Asserted Caller Identity and Privacy within
trusted networks - Flemming Andreasen

     Good list discussion 1 month ago; currently in WG LC. There have
     been some offline comment that have not been incorporated in the
     I-D yet.

     Overview of changes: applicability statement (only suitable in
     the same admin domain, draft is for network-asserted identity,
     not user-asserted). Anonymity header got removed. Grammar fixes
     to be consistent with -09 bis.

     Open issues: 1) Proxy handling of RP-ID received from untrusted
     entity (proxy or UA) 2 options: 1) if verifiable, set screen=yes
     2) always remove untrusted RP-ID Option 1 seems more general then
     2; Recommendation: Option 1.

     This generated a lot of discussion, mostly revising around
     policies vs. protocols, network asserted identities vs. user
     asserted identities, (in)security of this I-D and why it will not
     be acceptable to IESG, and this being more for the benefit of
     3GPP.

     Randy Bush discussed current unacceptability of draft to
     operations directorate, and agreed to Send Text.

Honestly, I am flattered that you are hoping for the IETF blessing for
building a service. However, building such an anonyzmizer in (3) is well
within the scope of the SIP protocol, and requires no standardization
activity or consensus from IETF. I personally believe that you need a
full b2bua, since privacy, from a user perspecitve, WILL involve
stripping everything which might reveal identity, no matter whether the
header formally has identity information or not. Thus, I am not sure
what there is to do, but to emphasize to our friends in 3gpp to NOT
always put anonymous values in the To/From as this clearly will break
all reasonable interop with the outside world. (1) is BAD. Does anyone
dispute that?

Of course we should do this anyway, but it does not solve the problem. The
proposition (*) was about personal data of people *other than the caller*
e.g. the subscriber. The UA does not necessarily have the information about
these people's privacy requirements unless we invent a way of getting it
there, and then enforcing its use.

It's not about 'telco like' vs 'Internet like'. It's not about the
technology at all. We have to look at the *service* as it is supplied to the
user. If you have a Service Provider model at all, then the Service Provider
has responsibilities about what they do with people's Personal Data, whether
the service it implemented using IPv20 between nano-machines or over a wet
piece of string.

As I've argued before, a privacy service which pupports to protect the
subscriber's privacy, but which does not amend the
'What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me:' field, will not be very impressive to the
subscriber. Especially if there are 'guidelines' indicating that the user
should put their identity in this field so that *in practice*, Personal Data
of the subscriber appears in this field 99% of the time.

Now I'm just putting this as a proposition. I don't know what view Data
Protection regulators would take on this. But I think from a common-sense
analysis there is a good chance that privacy services might reasonably be
expected to modify such a field, since otherwise the service is only 1%
effective in practice.

It is actually more important 'what works' than philosphical arguments about
whose responsibility it is.

The SP does have some responsibility if they have required that the UA
follow a certain spec, which recommends certain behaviour.

By contrast, there is no implication whatsoever that there should be
presonal data in the subject field. I think that a privacy service which did
not modify the subject field is less likely to cause problems, although of
course there may well be people who want that blotted out too - the
user/subscriber can choose this at the price of loss of service
transparency.

We don't know for certain what Data Protection will/won't require, but I
believe we have to be prepared for all reasonable eventualities. My
contention is just that it is sufficiently likely that privacy services will
be required to modify these fields that we ought to consider it. Mayby it
will never be required, in which case good, but I would like us to agree
that if it *is* required, then there is an agreed way to do it.

I agree with this, with the caveat that from a Service perspective there are
grey areas about who is responsible for a particular piece of information. A
Service Provider may have some responsibility for apparently user-supplied
information if it is implicit or required in the service that the user shall
supply a certain piece of information in that field. Whether the network
equipment checks/processes etc. that field seems irrelevant to me in this
respect.

I'm glad to hear you say this. Of course an individual could not expect free
consultancy from the IETF as to whether a given service worked, was valuable
etc. But here we are talking about cooperation between standards fora, and I
think it is valid to ask the IETF SIP community for their opinion on how a
particular problem in another forum could or ought to be solved. If there
was consensus of opinion that would be a good thing too.

Others have said, variously:
i) Privacy services SHOULD NOT require modification of these fields, because
they are end-to-end and none of the business of the network
ii) A better solution to the b2bua one is to feed back the privacy
requirements to the UA and then reject requests which do not meet the
privacy requirements

I think we can certainly say that (i) is a matter of opinion. I for one do
not feel confident that it would be safe for a Service Provider to bet on
this with respect to Data Protection.

(ii) requires standardisation and IMO doesn't quite work anyway.

I haven't seen anyone dispute that here. My point is that to credibly assert
that (1) is bad, we have to describe an alternative. Does anyone dispute
that (3) is a valid alternative solution to this problem ?

It has been stated in this group often that B2BUAs are BAD, and that B2BUAs
break services.  There has never yet been an example of a service that
is broken because of a B2BUA, but this belief seems generally accepted.

This is the first claim I've seen that putting anonymous strings in the
From and To headers also will break services.  I must admit I have more
trouble accepting this belief than the "B2BUA breaks services" belief.
An example of a service that this breaks would be even more useful.

But if both are true, then the question is: which is less bad?
I think this is a judgement call based on perceived gleanings
from crystal balls, and mine is cloudy.  Does someone else have 
a clearer crystal ball on the subject?

Honestly, I am flattered that you are hoping for the IETF blessing for
building a service. However, building such an anonyzmizer in (3) is well
within the scope of the SIP protocol, and requires no standardization
activity or consensus from IETF. I personally believe that you need a
full b2bua, since privacy, from a user perspecitve, WILL involve
stripping everything which might reveal identity, no matter whether the
header formally has identity information or not. Thus, I am not sure
what there is to do, but to emphasize to our friends in 3gpp to NOT
always put anonymous values in the To/From as this clearly will break
all reasonable interop with the outside world. (1) is BAD. Does anyone
dispute that?

But (3) is achievable now with a B2BUA, and there is no standardization 
work necessary.  Jonathan correctly pointed out that it is non-trivial
to achieve what appears to be desired, and a B2BUA that thoroughly
scrubbed all fields, including relaying of media, will be needed.
No additional headers can help you.

I think we should stop worrying about this case, and try to focus on
something we can't reasonably do now, which is to provide a network
asserted identity when the UA itself provides anonymity.  That is a
case worth working on, and it represents the way I think it SHOULD work.
The UA is by far in the best position to determine the level of
anonymity it wishes, and if it can't get enough (because, for example,
it wants it's IP addresses obscured), it will have to employ a
B2BUA as above.

Just on this one issue of obfuscation of the From/To field.... 
Let's be really clear about why this has come about: 
Some Service Providers *believe* in the following proposition: 
(*) IF the UA is allowed to put identity information into From/To, THEN the
Service Provider will be forced (by Data Protection) to provide services
which modify these fields, in order to protect the privacy of people other
than the actual calling user - subscriber, forwarding etc.
First, set aside the question of whether to agree with (*) or not. 
There are three options for people with this belief: 
1) *Require* permanantly that the UA does not put identity information into
From/To 
2) Reject requests where the UA puts identity information in From/To if
privacy is required 
3) Build network services which provide the necessary modification
(+whatever else is needed) 
I do not think there are any other options. 
We all agree that (1) is bad. (2) looks attractive but is not backwards
compatible, requires a double request (not good for wireless) & has issues
as to whether you trust the UA (in redirection scenarios).
I was looking for a consensus that (3) is a possible and valid thing to do
for these Service Providers. If the IETF SIP group agree that (3) and not
(1) is _a_ valid solution to this problem, then there is more chance of
other fora adopting (3) instead of (1).
So far, people have been arguing against the belief (*). The question is not
whether (*) is demonstrably true but whether there is sufficient *chance* of
it being true to justify serious consideration. A significant group of
Service Providers obviously think it is - they are worried they will be in
this situation and want a solution defined - that should be enough for us to
discuss solutions.
So, can we agree to recommend at least that people with belief (*) adopt
solution (3) and not solution (1) ?

Agree on all points.

But if the best example of a "broken service" is equivalent to
the claim that "my deleting of unopened email is a
failure of the email delivery system"  ???  This is somehow a
different category than call transfers (for instance) failing.

I think B2BUAs are great for some things.

I suspect that an anoymizer B2BUA is a very good thing.

To me, the service that breaks with anonymous From/To is
the ability to call me.  If my phone rings, and the "From"
which is displayed says "anonymous", I'm not going to answer it.
I'll probably instruct my voicemail service to do the same.
The Police Tip line might very well accept such calls however.

I'm reminded of the practices of some Hollywood types that
block Caller-Id, but won't accept calls that don't provide
Caller-Id!

Agreed.  Don't forget the obvious problem of any crypto (signatures
for example) on any of these fields!

I think B2BUAs are great for some things.

I suspect that an anoymizer B2BUA is a very good thing.

To me, the service that breaks with anonymous From/To is
the ability to call me.  If my phone rings, and the "From"
which is displayed says "anonymous", I'm not going to answer it.
I'll probably instruct my voicemail service to do the same.
The Police Tip line might very well accept such calls however.

I'm reminded of the practices of some Hollywood types that
block Caller-Id, but won't accept calls that don't provide
Caller-Id!

I agree completely. Others claimed that the problem did not exist.

Also, there can be a range of privacy services, requiring more, or less,
field modification etc. You will at least need to modify From/To & probably
Call-Info, Reply-To etc.

Absolutely. I hope that this thread has demonstrated, though, that it is not
*because* of RPID that people have done Bad Things with From/To, more the
other way round.

Agreed. But the UA is not in a good position to determine the subscribers
anonymity requirements, or other parties not represented by a UA. In a
Service Provider model, these people have some rights. So, the network may
have to employ a B2BUA or whatever on behalf of these people. There is no
problem with this and so no case for obfuscating the From/To fields - agreed
?

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that some are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; worried about with RPID. The point of =
disagreement was </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; whether in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; case of Call-Info, this would be =
'major abuse', with RPID </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; was set up to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; make these 'Bad Things' easy, or =
whether there was some </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; equivalence. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The key point is that this kind of =
abuse of Call-Info may </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; happen if we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; do not provide an alternative. =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; It was never our intent for Call-Info to =
provide any form </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of network </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; asserted identity that could be used in =
any useful way. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Generally, the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; idea was that insertion of Call-Info was =
either done by the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; UA, or in </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the case of proxy-inserted values, was for =
&quot;opt-in&quot; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; services were the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; user had signed up for content to be =
added. That said, there are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; certainly cases where the caller may opt =
in for this service </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; but require </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; privacy for a particular call, and we need =
a mechanism to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; support that. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; However, in no way would I support or =
advocate the use of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Call-Info as </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an alternative for R-P-ID. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Abuse of From/To headers </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Jon is concerned that 'untrusted =
RPID' provides a standardised </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; alternative to From/To, allowing Bad =
Things, like never </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; putting the real </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; From/To information in the From/To =
fields. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I think that the proper way to handle =
this, as pursued in </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; other threads, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; is to provide a sane alternative to 3gpp =
so that they don't </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; do this. I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; believe we all agreed it would be bad. =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Others have pointed out that the =
draft explicitly states </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that untrusted </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; UAs MUST NOT add RPID. However the =
draft explicitly </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; described proxy </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; handling of RPID headers from =
untrusted sources (proxies OR </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; UAs), and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; allows these to be propogated, marked =
as untrusted. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, a UA which DID add RPID, =
although non-compliant </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to the draft, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; would have its RPID propogated =
through the network. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) 'Untrustworthy RPID' </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Flemming, Bill et al argued that RPID =
information is still </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; useful when </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; it is 'untrustworthy'. This can occur =
legitimately within </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the draft when </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; an RPID which is not 'private' (and =
so not encrypted) </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; crosses a trust </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; boundary. This would represent an =
identity asserted by </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Network A and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; passed to Network B, when B has no =
explicit trust </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; relationship with A. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The contention was that since this =
information still has </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; some value, it </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; should be passed to the UAS for =
display, and might also have some </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; application for call trace, although =
obviously not as useful as a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 'trustworthy' identity. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Jon argued that the From field =
provides well enough for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; display, and the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; value of untrustworthy information =
for call trace is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; debatable (and has </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; been debated at length). </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; IMHO, 'untrusted RPID' is identical to the =
From, except that it is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; purportedly inserted by a network element, =
whereas From is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; purportedly </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; inserted by the end user. Neither provides =
any guarantees. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The essence </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; of the debate, I think, is whether you =
believe there is value </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to the end </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; user in a field which is the identity =
purportedly inserted by some </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; network element.&nbsp; Since there is =
apparently value to the identity </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; purportedly inserted by the end user, I =
see no reason why we should </FONT>

I agree that, in general, the UA should be treated like a mature adult
and get to make decisions as to what information it wants to include in
its call setup requests or not. I don't agree that anonymity requires a
B2BUA in all cases. For example, one could imagine that a large ISP
could hand out random IP addresses from a large pool, making it
essentially similar to an anonymizer service. There is no principal
difference between knowing that "user came from anonymizer service
anon.com" and "user came from ISP large-isp.com". (Well, almost: it may
be easier to switch anonymity providers than ISPs.) With VPN services
and L2 tunneling, you can probably create IP-level anonymous ISPs that
don't require B2B UAs and cover a very large geographical area.

A privacy B2BUA would break services, since it would have to strip all
headers, thus disabling any service that it doesn't happen to know
about.

B2BUAs are also, it seems, much more loop-prone than proxies. For
examples, see mailing list hosts, which are essentially SMTP B2BUAs.
(They also illustrate the service transparency issues, with endless
debates as to what fields should have which values and whether header
fields should or should not be copied.)

Very sensible. It could be anyone!

You might answer it if the call came from a Service Provider that you
trusted, and that Service Provider had mechanisms to verify and record the
identity of the caller, and to pass that identifier to the authorities if
the call turns out to be malicious.

There is always a balance between the desire of the caller to remain
anonymous and of the called party to reject anonymous calls. Without an
intermediary then the balance gets tipped completely to one side or the
other.

Content-Type: text/plain

There are many privacy services between the extremes of 'entirely up to the
UAs' and 'full B2BUA with IP address anonymiser etc.'.

All of them require 'More Than Just A Proxy' because you need to modify the
From/To fields (unless you don't care about RFC2543 compatibility, in which
case you can modify these fields at something very like a proxy).

Other fields may or may not need to be modified/removed - certainly
Call-Info & Reply-To would have to go. I think you *can* run the end-to-end
data argument with things like Subject and the message body.

There is the possibility that new headers exist which carry identity
information or other Personal Data. One solution would be to remove all
unrecognised headers at the Privacy server. This will break all the new
things.

There is another way. This would be to define now a generic capability for
carrying Personal Data, along with an indication of its privacy status. All
new services introduced later which required to send Personal Data would use
this capability. So, privacy servers could be built now which would just
remove private data from this new place, leaving unrecognised headers alone.

The privacy server would still break new services based on Personal Data -
but this is the intention of the caller. The privacy server would not break
other new things.

I have a feeling this thread should be moved to SIPPING: we're going round
and round with requirements.  Anyway, I've seen two sensible points today
that call for action:

Brian identified a need for a mechanism by which the network provides a
network-asserted identity.  Is RPID this mechanism, or do we look for
another, or do we explore the requirements further?

Mark has just come up with a very interesting idea for quarantining
privacy-related material.  I can see immediately that this requires a good
deal of careful work at the protocol level.  Do we need some more
exploration of the requirements here?

This discussion seems to have gotton off of the real requirement, which is to 
correctly handle calling user identities that are needed as part of the 
service offering. That is, the information needed to process a call setup but 
not necessarily needed by the called user (except out of curiousity). There 
have been a number of suggestions that the "privacy" service must 
remove/mask/encrypt any other information which the calling user entered, 
such as "Subject" that might give away their identity. This is absurd. No 
network or B2BUA of trusted proxy or whatever you want to call it could know 
when to do this. There can never be any "service" which changes or looks at 
the "Subject" header.

If I block my calling line ID today (telephone number) from being delivered 
to the other end and then, when someone answers, say "This is Mike Pierce", 
there is no requirement that the network remove that identity. Nor should 
there be any belief that the "network" should block the call if I voluntarily 
enter some identifying information.

As Mark Watson noted "A Service Provider may have some responsibility for 
apparently user-supplied information if it is implicit or required in the 
service that the user shall supply a certain piece of information in that 
field."

This discussion should only deal with the specific information that the 
identity/privacy service deals with. I guess that's the To and From headers 
and any new headers that might be created to get around limitations of these 
headers.

I think the message from some on this list is that there is no way that the 
identity/privacy "service" is going to work correctly unless there is a full 
"standard" defining the required interoperation between end user UAs and 
"network" devices supplied by "Service Providers", whether you call them 
B2BUAs, proxies, or anonymizers. By "correctly", I mean in accordance with 
the law in effect at the location where the calling and called party is. 
Unless we admit to this model as the basis for requirements, no progress can 
be made. Of course, I am referring to the model # 1 I listed in my April 4 
e-mail which were:

1. With a trusted third party (Read: service provider) which provides 
services, one of those services being to guarantee privacy/protection/etc.
2. Without a trusted third party (Read: Wild-wild west) meaning that there 
are no services being provided. End users do anything they want and no one is 
guaranteed of anything (e.g., privacy, protection, or that anything they try 
to do will neccesarily function as they expect).

As Mark Watson wrote in his e-mail of April 12: "It's not about 'telco like' 
vs 'Internet like'. It's not about the technology at all. We have to look at 
the *service* as it is supplied to the user. If you have a Service Provider 
model at all, then the Service Provider has responsibilities about what they 
do with people's Personal Data, whether the service it implemented using 
IPv20 between nano-machines or over a wet piece of string."

Once again, it seems that this discussion needs to be split into addressing 
these two completely different environments with potentially completely 
different solutions. I know that sounds bad, and contradicts some views of 
what the Internet should be, but I see no other approach.

My 2 cents worth!

Mike

The issue here is not what any of us want to do to "contaminate" the purity 
of IP or to make it look like the PSTN with its "limited" capabilities, but 
rather, what will be required by various regulatory agencies once they 
realize that, if IP is going to be used to replace traditional telephone 
service, it has to comply with all the same rules and regulations. The area 
of calling line ID presentation and restriction is the most complicated, with 
different rules in different states and countries.

Voice over IP isn't going to escape this regulation for long. It will get 
"telco-like" requirements sooner or later. It's pretty obvious to me that 
there needs to be an agreement on the requirements before any more discussion 
on the protocol details that might be needed to solve an (undefined) problem.

The problem with this line of thinking is that in the PSTN, identity is
always asserted by
the network, and never by the UA.  In SIP, presently, identity is always
asserted by
the UA and never the network.  Privacy when you have network asserted
identity
means something different than when you have user asserted identity.
 
There are no regulations, and I don't see any reason to believe that
regulators
will slavishly follow the current practice.  Until you have evidence to the
contrary,
arguing that the same SOLUTIONS are required is not helpful. 
 
What you do need to cater for is services.  If there are UAs that have
anonymity services,
a customer might prefer that UA from another.  If a service provider
provides an
anonymity service, that may find some customers.  If both exist, then
regulators may
be content, or they may require that all service providers provide B2BUAs.  
 
Without a network asserted identity, either a UA can implement anonymity, or
a B2BUA can do that.  No standards required in the IETF for that.
 
The problem comes with network asserted identity.  There is a clear
requirement
to be able to do a call trace on an anonymous call.  Proponents of a network
asserted identity posit that NAI is how you do call trace.  Opponents
counter that
you can't actually achieve anonymity with network asserted identity. That, I
believe
is the crux of the problem we now face: how to trace a call while allowing
the
user to actually be anonymous.
 
If we could get consensus that trace-with-anonymity is the problem, then we
can
work on solutions.  Until we get to something as straightforward as that,
we are going to spin a lot of wheels.

I continue to be confused by this emphasis on the "privacy" half of the 
draft. It seems to be expanding to consider "Privacy" of everything including 
what color socks the user is wearing! I know that the overwhelming thoughts 
in the IETF are to protect privacy, and I don't dispute that, but the primary 
purpose of this draft (and the "service" it defines) is to provide an 
"Identity" service, that is, providing one user's identity to the other user. 
"Privacy" is the second half. We need to agree on what that identity is and 
how it is provided. Then the second part of the issue is how that identity is 
protected when the user doesn't want it delivered to the other user (assuming 
the "network" needs it or knows it). I know this sounds elementary and maybe 
some think it is obvious, but when the discussion of "privacy" begins to 
define ways to treat future headers carrying other personal data, I think it 
is going beyond its purpose.

As Mark noted, a Service Provider may have responsibiity for user-supplied 
information if it is implicit or required in the service that the user supply 
it (to set up the call). Any extra stuff that is defined just to be passed 
end-to-end (like Subject) or for a completely different service is not a 
concern. If the user voluntarily includes it, it is not private.

For example, Dean started a discussion of a 'What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me:' 
field instead of "From". To me, the fundamental difference is that the "From" 
field is part of the call setup specification and the "network" should 
require it, but the "What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me" field could be see as only 
being of end-to-end significance and not looked at by the "network". The 
basic question for this and any field is: "Is it part of 'Identity' or is it 
supplemental information?"

I agree that this needs to be moved to SIPPING and focus on the requirements. 
We need to get away from the discussion of protocol mechanisms for awhile and 
agree on what the requirements are.

The issues from the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs above, levaing out the protocol 
stuff, are:

What are the requirements for the network to verify a user provided identity?
What are the requirements for the network to add a network-asserted identity?
Are there requirements to "Quaratine" or hide any other user provided 
identity related material?

Mike

 Voice over IP isn't going to escape this regulation for long. It will
get "telco-like" requirements sooner or later. It's pretty obvious to me
that there needs to be an agreement on the requirements before any more
discussion on the protocol details that might be needed to solve an
(undefined) problem.  
-------------- 
 
I don't completely disagree. In fact, I'm arguing the requirements.
 
The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied
information. The Service Provider doesn't insert them, inspect them, or
have any responsibility for them. Insisting that the service provider
change them is just like insisting that the service provider change any
other user-supplied information, such as the words I'm typing now.
Anything I put in my To or from field is deliberately and explicitly
intended to be delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if
as a service provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my
data, and my lawyers will be in touch!
 
The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID) is
NOT inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE
CONSENT of the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the
protection of that information in a manner consistent with regulation
and the expressed wishes of the user.
 
The calling-line-identity-restriction information (CLIR or Privacy) is a
means by which the user expresses wishes with respect to the handling of
NETWORK provided information.
 
This divides data into three classes:
 
1) Data inserted by a user's system, under the control of a user, and
intended to be delivered to the termination of the dialog
2) Data inserted by a user's system, under the control of a user,
intended to be delivered to an intermediate system and not beyond
3) Data inserted by the network, without the awareness of a user,
intended to be delievred to an intermediary or terminal point.
 
Service providers are by regulation in reasonable nations required to
prevent class 2 information from being leaked, and to respect the user's
preferences for delivery of class 3 data. 
 
The problem is, the "normal" telephone network doesn't obviously HAVE
user-provided information in the signaling path which is intended to be
delivered to the other end, so telco people start by assuming that all
signaling is the responsibility of the service provider. But there
really is something analogous. Consider Q.SIG, user signaling at the
ISDN level generally used for PBX-to-PBX work. What Mark has been
arguing is essentially like arguing that a service provider must PREVENT
the delivery of Q.SIG data because it MIGHT compromise Data Privacy. Of
course it does! It's SUPPOSED to! The operator's responsibility is to
limit the delivery of the data to the intended party (as opposed to
deliverying it to somebody else), not to keep the user from
communicating with the intended party.
 
That's right, kids -- SIP by definition is an enhanced service channel.
It does MORE than plain-old-telephone-service. If you use it carefully,
you can emulate POTS.
 
So, what are these "anoymizer" services we keep talking about? Are they
consistent with my data class division? Notice that class #1 says "to
the termination of the dialog". In using such a service, I'm requesting
that my dialog terminate at an intermediate point which implements the
service of generating a second related but anonymized dialog. In other
words, the behavior is explicitly requested by the user, and is
therefore "ok with me".

Mike,
 
My suggestion of a generic mechanism to carry Personal Data was targetting
at future work, not the present privacy draft.
 
Two points:
1) It's not just about privacy for the calling user - that's relatively
easy, you just need a mechanism to 'privately' pass information to trusted
network entities and apart from that it's up to the UA what it does/doesn't
reveal. The big problem is when other people are involved who do not have an
'agent' representing them. A subscriber to a public service is an example.
These people have rights which only the Service Provider knows about. The
Service Provider cannot be responsible for sending Personal Data of the
subscriber to the called party. Unfortunately the identity of the calling
user can often include personal data of the subscriber.
 
2) You said 'If the user voluntarily includes it, it's not private'. Sure,
it's not private *as far as the user is concerned*. But it might be private
with respect to other people. So the question is who was *responsible* for
sending it. If it's entirely the user then no problem - same as if it's the
first thing the user says after Answer. The problem is that To/From are a
grey area, since the SIP spec clearly intends that they contain the
calling/called identities (as would a spec for
'What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me'). A network based subscriber privacy service
which did not modify the From field would be pretty rubbish, whereas one
which did not modify the Subject would probably be fine.
 
...Mark

All of them require 'More Than Just A Proxy' because you need to modify the
From/To fields (unless you don't care about RFC2543 compatibility, in which
case you can modify these fields at something very like a proxy). 
Other fields may or may not need to be modified/removed - certainly
Call-Info & Reply-To would have to go. I think you *can* run the end-to-end
data argument with things like Subject and the message body. 
There is the possibility that new headers exist which carry identity
information or other Personal Data. One solution would be to remove all
unrecognised headers at the Privacy server. This will break all the new
things. 
There is another way. This would be to define now a generic capability for
carrying Personal Data, along with an indication of its privacy status. All
new services introduced later which required to send Personal Data would use
this capability. So, privacy servers could be built now which would just
remove private data from this new place, leaving unrecognised headers alone.

The privacy server would still break new services based on Personal Data -
but this is the intention of the caller. The privacy server would not break
other new things.

I continue to be confused by this emphasis on the "privacy" half of the
draft. It seems to be expanding to consider "Privacy" of everything
including what color socks the user is wearing! I know that the overwhelming
thoughts in the IETF are to protect privacy, and I don't dispute that, but
the primary purpose of this draft (and the "service" it defines) is to
provide an "Identity" service, that is, providing one user's identity to the
other user. "Privacy" is the second half. We need to agree on what that
identity is and how it is provided. Then the second part of the issue is how
that identity is protected when the user doesn't want it delivered to the
other user (assuming the "network" needs it or knows it). I know this sounds
elementary and maybe some think it is obvious, but when the discussion of
"privacy" begins to define ways to treat future headers carrying other
personal data, I think it is going beyond its purpose. 

As Mark noted, a Service Provider may have responsibiity for user-supplied
information if it is implicit or required in the service that the user
supply it (to set up the call). Any extra stuff that is defined just to be
passed end-to-end (like Subject) or for a completely different service is
not a concern. If the user voluntarily includes it, it is not private. 

For example, Dean started a discussion of a 'What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me:'
field instead of "From". To me, the fundamental difference is that the
"From" field is part of the call setup specification and the "network"
should require it, but the "What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me" field could be see
as only being of end-to-end significance and not looked at by the "network".
The basic question for this and any field is: "Is it part of 'Identity' or
is it supplemental information?"

points:</SPAN></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Verdana size=1><SPAN class=134303515-12042002>1) 
It's not just about privacy for the calling user - that's relatively easy, you 
just need a mechanism to 'privately' pass information to trusted network 
entities and apart from that it's up to the UA what it does/doesn't reveal. The 
big problem is when other people are involved who do not have an 'agent' 
representing them. A subscriber to a public service is an example. These people 
have rights which only the Service Provider knows about. The Service Provider 
cannot be responsible for sending Personal Data of the subscriber to the called 
party. Unfortunately the identity of the calling user can often include personal 
data of the subscriber.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Verdana size=1><SPAN

<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Verdana size=1><SPAN class=134303515-12042002>2) 
You said 'If the user voluntarily includes it, it's not private'. Sure, it's not 
private *as far as the user is concerned*. But it might be private with respect 
to other people. So the question is who was *responsible* for sending it. If 
it's entirely the user then no problem - same as if it's the first thing the 
user says after Answer. The problem is that To/From are a grey area, since the 
SIP spec clearly intends that they contain the calling/called identities (as 
would a spec for 'What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me'). A network based subscriber 
privacy service which did not modify the From field would be pretty rubbish, 
whereas one which did not modify the Subject would probably be 
fine.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

 Voice over IP isn't going to escape this regulation for long. It will get
"telco-like" requirements sooner or later. It's pretty obvious to me that
there needs to be an agreement on the requirements before any more
discussion on the protocol details that might be needed to solve an
(undefined) problem.  
-------------- 
 
I don't completely disagree. In fact, I'm arguing the requirements.
 
The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied
information. The Service Provider doesn't insert them, inspect them, or have
any responsibility for them. Insisting that the service provider change them
is just like insisting that the service provider change any other
user-supplied information, such as the words I'm typing now. Anything I put
in my To or from field is deliberately and explicitly intended to be
delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if as a service
provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my data, and my lawyers
will be in touch! 
 

For this discussion to make ANY sense we have to stop talking about user
device & network devices and which does what etc. etc. The only important
point is what is the *service* that the service provider is offering. If it
is a mandatory part of the service that a certain piece of personal data is
passed to the service provider, then the service provider has a
responsibility not to reveal that if the user *or subscriber* does not want
it.
 
It does not matter one iota whether the piece of data was inserted by the
user equipment of something else.
 
Basically, the functional distribution of the system is irrelevant, what is
important is what it does.
 
Now if the service involves carrying an opaque piece of data to the called
party, then obviously the only person with responsibility for that is the
person generating the data.
 
If I understand correctly, Dean, you are arguing that the To and From fields
work like this.
 
I have been arguing that this MAY not be a reasonable position for a Service
Provider when arguing their case with respect to Data Protection. This is on
the basis that the SIP spec pretty clearly implies that these fields will
contain certain information and a Service Provider could reasonably be
expected to know this.
 
Plus "a 'subscriber privacy' service which did not modify these fields would
not impress the subscriber much, as 99% of calls would go through with
personal data of the subscriber presented to the called party" - (I'm going
to put that one on a function key :-)

 
The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID) is NOT
inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE CONSENT of
the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the protection of that
information in a manner consistent with regulation and the expressed wishes
of the user. 
 

Absolutely. 

 
The calling-line-identity-restriction information (CLIR or Privacy) is a
means by which the user expresses wishes with respect to the handling of
NETWORK provided information.
 
This divides data into three classes:
 
1) Data inserted by a user's system, under the control of a user, and
intended to be delivered to the termination of the dialog
2) Data inserted by a user's system, under the control of a user, intended
to be delivered to an intermediate system and not beyond
3) Data inserted by the network, without the awareness of a user, intended
to be delievred to an intermediary or terminal point.
 
Service providers are by regulation in reasonable nations required to
prevent class 2 information from being leaked, and to respect the user's
preferences for delivery of class 3 data.  
 

Or rather:
1) Opaque data on which the service places no requirement or expectation
2) Data required or expected to be supplied by the user to the service
provider as part of the operation of the service
3) Data used within the service provider for the provision of the service

 
The problem is, the "normal" telephone network doesn't obviously HAVE
user-provided information in the signaling path which is intended to be
delivered to the other end, so telco people start by assuming that all
signaling is the responsibility of the service provider. But there really is
something analogous. Consider Q.SIG, user signaling at the ISDN level
generally used for PBX-to-PBX work. What Mark has been arguing is
essentially like arguing that a service provider must PREVENT the delivery
of Q.SIG data because it MIGHT compromise Data Privacy. Of course it does!
It's SUPPOSED to! The operator's responsibility is to limit the delivery of
the data to the intended party (as opposed to deliverying it to somebody
else), not to keep the user from communicating with the intended party.
 

Great choice of example ... I know just a little bit about this ...
 
Applying my argument to the Q.SIG data would imply that the subscriber has a
right to request that this data not be delivered. Well, that's exactly how
the service works, certainly according to the ITU-T standards, because the
Q.SIG data is only delivered within a closed user group. i.e. the subscriber
expresses their preference as to exactly whom the data can be delivered to
in the specification of the closed user group.
 
Indeed, the subscriber would have the right to request that the information
is never delivered, but that would rather defeat the object. As has been
pointed out a few times there is a natural trade-off between services and
privacy.
 
...Mark

 
That's right, kids -- SIP by definition is an enhanced service channel. It
does MORE than plain-old-telephone-service. If you use it carefully, you can
emulate POTS.
 
So, what are these "anoymizer" services we keep talking about? Are they
consistent with my data class division? Notice that class #1 says "to the
termination of the dialog". In using such a service, I'm requesting that my
dialog terminate at an intermediate point which implements the service of
generating a second related but anonymized dialog. In other words, the
behavior is explicitly requested by the user, and is therefore "ok with me".

Hi,

Please read and comment on sec-agree.  We hummed to make this a WG item,
so we should get a few eyeballs on it sooner rather than later.

We need to quickly review the SIM Message Method Extension. This draft
has been widely discussed, iterated several times in SIMPLE, and is on
its 2nd revision in SIP. The draft does not appear to be controversial.

See:

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-message-01.txt

We expect to move to IETF last call next week, so please raise any
issues immediately.

Ben Campbell will coordinate for the draft editors.

Yes, I suspected that, but then I noticed that Tom picked up on it as an

I'm confused by what you are getting at by "subscribers" and "other people" 
(who don't have an "agent"), and "calling user". There is a SIP phone 
(containing a "User Agent") and it might be used by multiple people to place 
calls. If people don't have their own identity, then every call must use the 
identity of the physical device. If there is a capability for each person to 
provide a separate identity, then that is what is used by the "network" as 
the basis for a "subscription" to service and to apply privacy.

If you are referring to the complicated cases of how to apply "privacy" to 
identities involved in 3-way services such as call transfer and call 
forwarding, then I understand the difficulties, having been through 
excrutiating discussions in standards development for ISDN. It isn't easy or 
pretty. But these issues will only be worked out in a specific discusion of 
the interworking of the identity/privacy service with the call transfer/call 
forwarding services, something that the IETF is intent on not doing.

I still say if the user voluntarily includes something beyond the specific 
identity fields, then the network has no obligation to apply privacy to it. I 
don't see a case in which the network has to do anything else to provide 
privacy for "other people". Again, maybe there is a difference in what "user" 
refers to in your point 2) above. If the "standard" service operation (in the 
User Agent or network) puts in some identity, or passes along one it got 
during Call Transfer, then of course privacy rules must apply to it. That's 
not the user (person) voluntarily putting in the information.

There seems to be some confusion about the current "PSTN" situation. True, in 
the POTS PSTN (analog lines) the user doesn't actually include their identity 
in the signaling to the network. But, since the identity is directly 
associated with the physical phone line, it's the same thing. The telephone 
company simply converts its knowledge of the identity of the wire into a 
telephone number and goes from there.

In ISDN, on the other hand, the user can include their identity (phone 
number) in the signaling, since each physical interface and each device can 
support multiple telephone numbers. The number is put in the Calling Party 
Number field. The network may screen this number to make sure it is a valid 
number for that interface. Depending on the result of the screening, the 
network may include multiple numbers in the call set up, for example, an 
unverified user provided number and the network provided valid number.

The user may specify by per-call signaling or by a permanent subscription 
option whether or not they want the network to apply the restriction 
("privacy") feature to this identity (whether the identity came from the user 
or was added by the network or both doesn't matter). There is no attempt to 
also apply "privacy" if the user chooses to put some other identifying 
information in the User-to-user field.

We have to decide whether the From/To fields are like the Calling Party 
Number field in ISDN (meant for user-network signaling and left to the 
network to change if required by the service) or are they like the 
User-to-user field in ISDN (never touched by the network). I've heard both 
sides of the argument being made, so there is apparently not a consistent 
view on how basic SIP works.

It seems that the added RPID field is similar to the network added (verified) 
number in ISDN.

Subject: [Sip] Call establishment over TCP
Sender: sip-admin@ietf.org

Hi,
    Let us consider a call between 2 UAs over TCP:
       UA1   <--------->    UA2

UA1 sends an INVITE to UA2 over TCP (channel 1). The Contact header of
INVITE contains UA1's IP address and port 8000. UA2 responds to INVITE over
channel 1 and ACK is also sent over the same channel.

   Let us assume that UA2 determines to terminate the call. The question is:
 
Does UA2 send BYE over channel 1 or does it open a new TCP connection
(channel 2) to the server running at port 8000?

Regards,
Udaya

if someone subscribes to my sip service, i DO check for each message
received from the user that the from field corresponds to what i have
agreed with the user.  otherwise the user could fake to be somone else
that i consider a bad thing.  if the from field doesn't match, i don't
forward the message.  if that is not acceptable for the user, the use
can choose another service provider or roll its own service.  ii do not
modify anything.

i'm not damaging your data.  i simply don't serve your message and you
have no way to win the case in court.

   BTW, IPv6 already allows for private (read: formed
   dynamically and randomly by the host) IP addresses.
   The ISP doesn't even need to "allow" it or provide
   for it.

   This all gets down to your paranoia level. Prefixes
   do tell you something about IP topology which could
   lead to educated guesses -- which may be all that's
   necessary. Hopefully this level of paranoia will only
   be needed in the direst of cases like mob snitches, etc.

Oops.

Please review :

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-message-02.txt

Until the -02 makes it into the draft repository. They're not as fast as
I'm wishing for (ok, light speed is too slow, while we're at it!)

Thanks,

Original message:
-------------
We need to quickly review the SIM Message Method Extension. This draft
has been widely discussed, iterated several times in SIMPLE, and is on
its 2nd revision in SIP. The draft does not appear to be controversial.

See:

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-message-01.txt

We expect to move to IETF last call next week, so please raise any
issues immediately.

Ben Campbell will coordinate for the draft editors.

Actually, I just submitted draft-ietf-sip-message-02.txt yesterday. I
_thought_ that was the one we were going to WGLC. Since it does not seem to
have made the repository, I will send a link to it in a second message (any
moment now)

---------------------- 
There seems to be some confusion about the current "PSTN" situation.
True, in the POTS PSTN (analog lines) the user doesn't actually include
their identity in the signaling to the network. But, since the identity
is directly associated with the physical phone line, it's the same
thing. The telephone company simply converts its knowledge of the
identity of the wire into a telephone number and goes from there. 

In ISDN, on the other hand, the user can include their identity (phone
number) in the signaling, since each physical interface and each device
can support multiple telephone numbers. The number is put in the Calling
Party Number field. The network may screen this number to make sure it
is a valid number for that interface. Depending on the result of the
screening, the network may include multiple numbers in the call set up,
for example, an unverified user provided number and the network provided
valid number. 

The user may specify by per-call signaling or by a permanent
subscription option whether or not they want the network to apply the
restriction ("privacy") feature to this identity (whether the identity
came from the user or was added by the network or both doesn't matter).
There is no attempt to also apply "privacy" if the user chooses to put
some other identifying information in the User-to-user field. 

We have to decide whether the From/To fields are like the Calling Party
Number field in ISDN (meant for user-network signaling and left to the
network to change if required by the service) or are they like the
User-to-user field in ISDN (never touched by the network). I've heard
both sides of the argument being made, so there is apparently not a
consistent view on how basic SIP works. 

It seems that the added RPID field is similar to the network added
(verified) number in ISDN. 
------------------------ 

Excellent summary, Mike. That's exactly what I'm saying.

In short:

To:/From: are equivalent to ISDN user-to-user data, as is most of
current SIP.

RPID: is analogous to CPN, and its "Screened" parameter analogous to
what happens in ISDN today.

Privacy: is analogous to the calling line identification restriction
flag.
 
I think an understanding of this relationship should clear up 99% of the
debate over the "privacy" draft, which is really much more of a SIP-T

[Trimming privacy-threatening cc lines, revealing list membership :-)]

I think part of the problem is, as I think Dean and Brian have alluded
to, is that many things that used to be tied together in one mechanism
in the PSTN are now split across several different ones:

- From display name
- From URL
- RPID
- user authentication name (Authorization)
- Organization
- Call-Info

Also, to pick up the "disable CLID and disallow anonymous calls": I
think part of this has to do with the commingling of identity and the
ability to call back. I suspect that even the Hollywood mogul wouldn't
mind if his name appeared on the starlets display screen, but wants to
maintain the "don't call us, we'll call you" attitude, i.e., avoid
revealing a callable number.

I don't think anticipating regulation is particularly helpful here.
Anybody can say anything about what some legislature somewhere may
legislate at some point in the future.

I wouldn't be too surprised if, instead of PSTN legislation, some of the
email spam legislation finds its way into SIP behavior, e.g., having to
declare a truthful return address, an indication of the call intent
(like some of the laws and bills calling for adding ADV to the subject
line) or including an opt-out link (header?). If we could make progress
there, I think we'd do more for "privacy" than hiding a user name.

Yep, current B2BUA's would have problems if encryption or hashing is
done for many of the fields.

The development of SIPS is an example where current B2BUA's may run into
issues as SIPS is developed and standardized, unless they are also able
to verify hash or provide decryption/encrytpion as needed to provide the
service.

Speaking in terms of service provider, maybe that is where additional
headers should be required (Between B2BUA and/or SP/enterprise sip
proxies, rather than endpoints, for the interdomain traffic, in order to
hand off the "true" identity. Since hosts of service providers would
need to go through the registration and authentication process prior to
initiating sessions (for that point the SP customer would have to go
through a sign up for services process prior to be allowed to register).

I incorporated a few dozen suggested corrections into the Path draft. It
has been submitted to the internet-drafts queue and should appear there
shortly. In the interim, it should be available in the following
locations:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-03.txt

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-03.html

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-03.xml

If you have extensive edits to suggest, please make them relative to the
xml file. I'm using the xml2rfc package as a formatter, so this is the
"source code".

Note that the header is still called "Path". The suggested
"Register-Record-Route" was just too long and nobody really cheered for
my suggestion, "RRR". The topic is still open.

Main changes were ordering the Path elements in the same direction as
Record-Route elements (they were apparently backward) and cleanup of
typos. As requested by Miguel, I did a "Table 2" addition. The
references have also been divided into normative and non-normative
sections as currently required.

Enjoy.

Session 1
	
19:30 CST meeting started 
      Agenda accepted 
      Chairs discuss "Note Well" 2026 notice
	

Work Plan update:

     We have revised the SIP spec; went to IESG; resulted in a "Yea"
     from IESG. SIP events spec is done

     Session timer is back to haunt us -- goes back to authors for bis
     update.

     Caller pref - pending from author for bis. 

     Precondition extensions -- in WGLC now; in IESG by April SIP 

     Privacy spec from DCS in WGLC now, IESG by April 

     REFER Method; needs bis, security updates. IESG by May? No
     complaints from authors. More important since there are many
     implementations already.

     MESSAGE method ready for WG LC -- have not done it yet. 

     PATH method needs rev from editor. Call for volunteers. 

     NAT awareness: rev pending from author. 

     SIP Privacy and Security reqs to IESG? There is a feeling that
     the SIP extensions for privacy wrt to 3GPP is not achievable --
     Jon P: some privacy (user provided privacy vs. network provided
     privacy) nuances have not been captured as of today. Henning:
     that would make a lot of sense if we know what we wanted --
     another req document is not in and of itself useful. Dean: SIP
     privacy and security reqs predate the SIPPING WG -- IESG felt
     that it is such a critical piece that it should stay in SIP WG.

     SIP over SCTP? Gonzalo: we are ready for WG LC for
     SIP/SCTP. Dean: Also in July timeframe -- have a draft standard
     version of SIP -- #1 goal in July of 2003. Original SIP spec was
     2543, we want to claim new number of 3543 :-)

     State: Charter item of pushing certain things off the SIP
     signaling state -- state or cookies specification translated to
     SIP. Did we ever come to a consensus on how to go forward? Rohan:
     Cookies I-D is good for doing what you want to do with the state
     I-D and is more general. I support it. Dean: Anyone know of
     implementations? [No implementations yet] Jonathan Rosenberg: The
     reason no one has implemented it is because everyone is using R-R
     and Contact. It is not entirely clear to me that this is even
     needed. Flemming: The difference is that R-R requires the proxy to
     be in all signaling. Andrew Zmolek: We looked at R-R issue and it
     seemed that we were going to have some trouble -- either the
     state or the cookies would do fine JDR: R-R was not sufficient
     since there was no reliable way to put something and get it
     back. With the new R-R update, this is no longer an
     issue. rjsparks: You cannot change the state in a dialog, you can
     only push and get the state. JDR: Okay, if that is the
     requirement, then fine -- if the req is to just push state for
     the purpose of a dialog, we have a mechanism already in R-R,
     Contact. Brian Rosen: we may work on a requirement document
     offline, assuming that it is useful.

     General Scheduling: Henning: meta scheduling aspect -- can you
     get people involved long enough to remember what the issue was?
     Brian: Our goal is to get a lot of stuff out that has been
     hanging around for a long time -- but we do not want to get out
     12 LC I-Ds at the same time. We will revive the LC schedule we
     had going. Henning: Do other I-Ds that are not on your list wait
     until re- chartering? Brian: No. There are some things that are
     hanging around for a long time; as long as the ADs do not breath
     down on us, we will work on them as we go along. Henning: Need a
     priority list. Jonathan: Learn from successes -- Bundle 1 was a
     success delivery to 3GPP. With the current mechanism we were
     randomly LC'ing. One of the thing the Bundle did is to focus
     people's energy on that. Brian: We can consider that; Bundle 1's
     advantage was that the drafts were related to one another. These
     do not.

     What do we do with: sipping-conferencing-models? sip-3pcc?
     app-components? sip-vxml? Jonathan: need to finish bis update;
     but done as far as I know.  Rohan: 3PCC is a very pure usage
     draft describing the usage of baseline bis offer answer
     model. Most of the stuff above is usage or framework, we should
     get it done in SIPPING. Brian Rosen: You are basically saying
     what Jonathan said: Put it in Bundles. Rohan: Sure.
 

SIP Change process, Allison Mankin:

     This is not a SIP draft; it is an individual transport area
     draft. People have said that there is a need to control SIP
     information. The Replaces header was done in a freeform manner --
     this is not good. WG discipline needed over extensions of
     SIP. RFC 3261 (new bis) has an IANA consideration which is very
     different then what you have seen before. You need a standards
     track RFC for headers, method, response codes, warning codes. One
     place you do not need to do this is for the Events RFC -- just
     need WG yes for these. serverfeatures did not go too far with
     IESG since it offered unbridled extensions. We now have P-header
     (not X-header, more constrained). Still need a RFC, but you do
     not have to have the buy in of SIPPING or SIP. The string with P-
     is reserved if they are to have a future life. Henning: while I
     agree with the notion, the naming has the same problems that X
     headers had. Attaching a meaning to "P-" is not good. Allison:
     They do not have option tags and have to have applicability
     statements. Henning: There are 2 issues: naming and
     process/applicability. If we have a header name which was
     registered (say, foo); that header has the property that as long
     as it is in the non-RFC track, it looks like a normal header. If
     it reaches standards track, it retains its name. Lets say P-bar
     header becomes popular and widely implemented. Now, if P-bar
     header goes to standards track, they will have to rename this
     header. Allison: can you make a P-header a standards track header
     -- add an option tag. Dean: The P- name will still be registered
     and be useful. Now you will basically have to track P- and non-P
     extension headers -- makes the symbol table little large --
     that's okay. Dave Oran: feel uncomfortable in mixing naming
     conventions and algorithmic behavior. I do not like the idea of
     having to parse inside header string. Jonathan Rosenberg: The
     name of the option tag is unrelated to the name of the
     header. Henning: HTTP extension model is different then SIP
     extension model. There is no correlation in header names and
     option tags. Allison: If the I-D has any implications of this
     sort, we can fix it. Gonzalo: We have option tags that have no
     headers associated with them. Keith Drage: We need to make sure
     that this I-D does not contain any requirements on SIP
     implementation -- a SIP implementer must not have to read this
     I-D.

 

The UPDATE method - Jonathan Rosenberg :

     Open issues 

     1) Glare with PRACK - UPDATE only specifies glare resolution with
        itself. You can have glare with PRACK. Rejecting PRACK is
        bad. Solution: can't send UPDATE if you have sent an answer in
        18x for which you have not gotten a PRACK. Will put some words
        with general caveats.
    
     2) Repairable response codes -- automata can fix these without
        human intervention. What about 493 Undecipherable? May require
        user intervention to fix it. Proposal: include it, add text
        saying it retries if it would otherwise retry with that
        response. [No one objected].

     3) Generate 155 instead of 4xx MAY or SHOULD -- for backward
        compatibility. SHOULD is better if the UAS supports this
        capability, the proxy may not. This makes it work at proxies
        transparently. Comment: This text is screaming for a reason
        header, otherwise the UAC will have to infer what the problem
        is. JDR: I did not talk about reason header for a reason -- it
        is on a slower track. For the basic cases we are worried about
        immediately, the UAC can infer from the headers. Going
        forward, the reason header is the way to go. Gonzalo: The last
        review of the reason header already has this, so we can use
        it. Jonathan: Does the group agree that the message sip (or
        sip frag) is the appropriate approach? Or wait for the reason
        header (which is on a slower track). Rohan: Can we pull out
        155 out of this, then? [No consensus on this]

 

Manyfolks open issues (Gonzalo Camarillo)
draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks...-05.txt 

     We are now defining a framework for preconditions of different
     types. We define the current status of the precond vs. desired
     status. We always know if current status is better or worse then
     desired status. Two status types: e2e -- always present in
     manyfolks (-04). Segmented status type introduced in -04.

     Open issues: Meaning of Require: precondition -- 2 approaches: I
     refuse everything I don't understand. Or be liberal and accept
     the offer if the preconditions can be met without your
     intervention? Which is better? 1 or 2? Comment: you can have a
     thing called "criticality" which gives a hint on what to
     do. Gonzalo: I will decide after speaking to Mark.

 

Reason code, Gonzalo Camarillo.:

     Requirements: same functionality needed in several WG items --
     why is this request (or response) being sent?

     Useful in many works: ISUP/SIP mapping, in manyfolks
     (precondition failure, unacceptable here), HERFP, 3pcc.

     Jonathan: Throw in another use: in the event that you fork the
     request to a bunch of phones and one of them picks up. The proxy
     generates CANCEL. The reason for CANCEL is not because the user
     hung up, but because 1 of N answered.

     Rohan: Lot of overlap in the reqs that generated this document
     and request history.

     Eric Burger: This is H.450 all over again.

     Jonathan R: Don't we have an enumerated list of response code in
     the bis already? This is exactly that, and then some.

     Comment: we have one address space for responses, and we have
     just added one more with the Reason header. Has a kitchen-sink
     feeling to it.

     Henning: The motivation was exactly to prevent reinventing the
     same thing every time. We are not adding new error classes that
     will have to be percolated to all existing implementation. This
     is a fine grained status code which is there if you need
     it. Example: Q.850 error code will not be pertinent to many
     implementations, but to the one that it is pertinent to, it can
     use it without too much perturbation.

     Brian Rosen: What do we do now? 2 possibilities: crisp set of
     reqs, which are clear and this is a reasonable solution. Or we do
     not have a crisp set of reqs. We need to determine this
     first. Lot of discussion on if this does or does not solve the
     job. But do we know what the job is? Should we push this back
     into sipping and generate a req document? Those who think we have
     a sensible set of reqs and we can move forward? Those who need
     more reqs? [The hum level was 50-50, no consensus by humming on
     if we have the reqs captured right.]

     Dave Oran: Need hum on slightly different -- do we get involved
     in reqs that requires identity (being able to communicate why you
     are sending it to this particular party).

     Brian Rosen: That is a reasonable suggestion -- so considered. We
     will get the reqs out before Yokohama and bring the solution out
     before then. Those of you who hummed against it should
     participate in the list when we discuss this on it.

 

 

Flemming Andreasen, SIP Extensions for Media Authorization.
draft-ietf-sip-call-auth-04.txt :

     Changes: Category is informational -- Header is now
     P-Media-Authorization. Applicability statement about appropriate
     use (SIP Proxy and Policy Server (PDP) must belong to the same
     domain) Updated rules about when to add a P-Media-Authorization
     header. Additional security considerations -- don't encrypt
     message bodies (proxies need to examine them).

     Open issues: None known (authors list need to be trimmed),
     currently in WGLC.

     Jonathan: I will send you some minor reviews. More look-see
     needed in the security section. This token is about media
     authorization -- authorization follows authentication. DOes the
     I-D point out this issue?

     Flemming: You do not necessarily need to authenticate before
     authorization. Some entity has been given an authorization token
     to access some resource.

     Jonathan: More discussion maybe needed on the security section --
     you are giving a token to a party that you may not have
     authenticated. If that is your model, fine; a couple of sentences
     would probably suffice in the I-D.

     Brian Rosen: The WGLC is going to get over, if anyone wants to
     raise more issues please do so. It fills the needs, even though
     it has a lot of limits. LC be it, we will move forward.

 

 

Ben Campbell, SIP Extensions for IM :

     -05 draft; recent changes -- remove CPIM mapping to separate
     draft. Would like to include in 3rd bundle to IESG.

     Highlights - sends IM; does not initiate a dialog, does not
     discuss message sessions; actual message in bodies.

     Open issues: No recent discussions. Needs minor editorial changes
     (forking, threading -- couple of sentences). Anything else? Is it
     ready for LC? One more revision -- no change in substance, more
     editorial.

     Brian Rosen: Ok, as soon as you have the revision, we will post
     it as LC.

     
Closing Remarks :

     Brian Rosen: Administering this list is no fun -- people forward
     their email to accounts that consistently run over quota. The
     list is setup so that only subscribers can post.

21:29 CST - WG adjourned. 



SIP Session 2, 53rd IETF 

Start 13:06 CST 

      Added AKA Digest and Path discussion to the Agenda. 
      Agenda accepted. 

Digest based authentication -- James Undery, Ubiquity 

      Quick run through of improvements to Digest
      authentication. UAC->UAS auth, UAC->Proxy authentication
      supported in the SIP spec. Our draft adds Proxy->UAS auth.,
      bid-down protection, mutual auth., integrity. Added 3 new
      headers and 1 new response (492) for Proxy->UAS authentication
      Bid-down protection: prefix added to nonces, protects scheme and
      quality of detection.

      Open issues: 1) No algorithm protection - if a hashing algo is
      broken, we need algo revocation. Proposal: make limitation
      explicit and rule that algo revocation is out of scope. 2) No
      negotiation of body integrity protection -- Proxies can't alter
      message bodies; Proposal : leave unchanged 3) No protection
      against weak passwords: Proposal - make limitation explicit, the
      solution is out of scope. 4) Client side can't initiate
      authentication 5) Forking and response collation issues - can't
      guarantee upstream entities see the challenges; response
      collation oriented towards success. Proposal: make limitations
      explicit.

      Jon: What are you trying to accomplish as a UAS by
      authenticating your upstream proxy? James: You may trust the
      proxy but not the link between the proxy and the UAS (for
      example: a radio interface). Jon: So this is the integrity
      process, not an authentication one. James: Authentication and
      integrity are closely linked. Rohan: We need to think about if
      this is needed? Looks like it is solved by TLS anyway. We need
      to understand under what circumstances we will use this
      approach. Jonathan: With this you do not know which proxy -- one
      up or 2 up -- you want to authenticate.

      Comment: You mention weak passwords; there are no strong
      passwords. You are unlikely to create a password that is not
      uncrackable, regardless of them appearing in the dictionary or
      not. Relying on a long random key is of no help. Christian: I
      would like to reinforce this point. Digest should be combined
      with strong authentication of the server, not on its
      own. Henning: when people talk about passwords, I wouldn't think
      that this is human generated; it is random string generated by
      some automata.

      Dean: Are we going to close any of these today? If not, let's
      take this to the mailing list. Brian: This has been hanging on
      for a long time; are we going to extend digest or not fortify it
      anymore. I do not know how to go ahed. People are saying that
      digest is terrible, but others are saying that it is still
      useful. I do not see other alternatives on the floor. Christian:
      2 forms with digest: 1 is if you are sending it as cleartext. 2
      is when you are doing digest with a 3rd party you have not
      authenticated. Simple thing for us is to use digest only for
      REGISTER not anything else. Brian: But there is no other
      solution on the table. Allison: The security review for bis came
      out as digest being a very lightweight way to do user
      authentication is okay. There is a good possibility of taking
      some time over this and making it better; maybe we should say
      that this document is not a WG document. We should discuss for
      the charter document something that exploits S/MIME. Rohan:
      There is some stuff in James' draft we can get consensus
      quickly; others may take some time. Allison: There is a huge
      deployment of digest. MD5 digest is known weak, but is not going
      to be thrown out. The topic we have now is not extending digest,
      but supporting some other password (a la AKA). For this
      document, consider what requirements it is meeting? Henning: One
      thing desperately needed in digest is registrar
      authentication. If we do something with digest at all, it must
      be this. Authenticating previous hops is nice, but not a known
      vulnerability we need solve now. Steven (3GPP): We do have a
      basic need to protect last hop integrity. We need to know what
      the intentions of the WG are towards digest. We need the
      direction very soon otherwise we are in a bind. Allison: Maybe,
      as Steven said, IPSec could be used for the short duration --
      could be the right way of meeting the requirement. Maybe we can
      have 5 minutes on some other agenda to talk about this. Brian:
      We are not getting anywhere -- let's move on and take it to
      list.


Digest AKA Authentication - Aki Nieme 

      AKA is a shared secret based auth that uses a smart card like
      device. Previous proposal (...-eap-01.txt) got good reception at
      SLC.

      Digest AKA reuses the digest scheme and uses the AKA parameters
      as input to the digest mechanism. AKA generates "one-time"
      passwords for Digest.

      Issues: 1) "Choke point" attack - similar to the weak password
      attack. 2) Should we adopt draf-niemi-sipping-digest-aka-00? It
      provides message integrity and is complementary to vanilla
      digest used today.

      Future: Will this become a work item for SIP WG? RFC category?
      There is some time pressure since 3GPP R5 is coming up. Can
      draft-niemi-digest-aka-00.txt be adopted as a solution?

      Allison: This does not involve any SIP extensions; just the
      extension of HTTP methods. It is good to get the SIP people's
      knowledge. There is no need for it to be a WG document; you can
      take it to RFC as an individual submission. Brian: Is there
      sufficient interest in the group to make it a WG item, or
      continue as an individual submission? [Took hum; the hum for
      people who want to make it a WG document prevailed]. Miguel
      Garcia: why use a 3G specific technology which has no broad
      impact on the Internet? Adam seconded. [The chairs agreed that
      we may have to revisit this issue again]


Security Negotiation open issues, Jari Akko 

     Presented issues, asked what to do next. Brian: Anyone object to
     NOT go forward with this? [No one objected; this is part of SIP
     WG]

SIP Extensions for Network Asserted Caller Identity and Privacy within
trusted networks - Flemming Andreasen

     Good list discussion 1 month ago; currently in WG LC. There have
     been some offline comment that have not been incorporated in the
     I-D yet.

     Overview of changes: applicability statement (only suitable in
     the same admin domain, draft is for network-asserted identity,
     not user-asserted). Anonymity header got removed. Grammar fixes
     to be consistent with -09 bis.

     Open issues: 1) Proxy handling of RP-ID received from untrusted
     entity (proxy or UA) 2 options: 1) if verifiable, set screen=yes
     2) always remove untrusted RP-ID Option 1 seems more general then
     2; Recommendation: Option 1.

     This generated a lot of discussion, mostly revising around
     policies vs. protocols, network asserted identities vs. user
     asserted identities, (in)security of this I-D and why it will not
     be acceptable to IESG, and this being more for the benefit of
     3GPP.

     Randy Bush discussed current unacceptability of draft to
     operations directorate, and agreed to Send Text.


REFER Open Issues -- Robert Sparks

      There was extended discussion about transitive security of the
      referral token (Referred-By) and its impact on the delivery
      schedule. Three-party problems are considered to be among the
      hardest of security problems to solve (Eric Rescorla). The
      authors recommend separating the problems, and doing REFER
      without Referred-By as a near term deliverable then tackle
      Referred-By as a separate task. The working group seems very
      interested in solving this problem and there was no clear
      consensus on separating it. However, it appears unlikely that
      this will be solved in the required May 30 timeframe, so we may
      need to administratively divide the problem space.

      Several proposals to resolve the transitive security requirement
      were discussed, with consensus seeming to form around an S/MIME
      approach.

Hi,

I'd like to announce a joint SIP/SIPPING interim meeting May 6-7 in Las
Vegas, Nevada.  This date and location were changed (with AD approval)
as a fallback due to conflicts with the previously proposed time and place
(Boston, the following week).

The meeting will occur at the Las Vegas Convention Center or the adjacent
Las Vegas Hilton Hotel (not to be confused with the Flamingo Hilton).
Inexpensive rooms and flights are still available.

Proposed Agenda:

Monday May 6
08:00  Agenda bashing, logistics
08:30  Open issues for REFER, Replaces, and cc-transfer
11:00  Multiparty and conferencing requirements
12:30  lunch
14:00  call-info and conference-info packages
16:00  Content-indirection
16:30  Binding published data to SIP
17:30  Wrap

Tuesday May 7
08:00   The long-term privacy solution
12:00   lunch
13:30   outstanding security issues/requirements
15:00   AAA requirements
17:30   Wrap

As always, drafts must be submitted by two weeks before the meeting,
(April 22).  Detailed minutes and blue sheets will be taken and posted to
the list.  All decisions based on a proto-consensus at the interim will go
back to the list.

If you are planning to attend, please send mail to me (rohan@cisco.com)
privately so I can get a room of an appropriate size.

thanks,
-rohan

p.s. A couple folks have asked for my motivation for suggesting an interim.
Basically we've got a lot of stuff on our plate in both WGs, and much of
it is in that midway done phase were face time is most valuable.
An interim would give us time to resolve several sticky technical issues
and then get drafts out before the cutoff date for IETF54.  I think
we could have a much more productive meeting in Japan as a result.

What happened to the 30 day advance notice (as your 4 April e-mail said was 
required)? I'm sure that other besides myself have already planned other 
things for May 6-7, since no interim meeting was announced on time.

Isn't there a mechanism whereby both UAs get back to an agreed 
state? How can the negotiation process continue properly 
otherwise?

But not in the case raised by Juha, where the Service Provider checks the
contents of the From field. Then these fields are more like the
user-provided Calling Party Number field which is checked by the local
exchange.

Even if the Service Provider does not do this checking, I would still argue
that there is an implicit expectation that these fields contain indentity
information, and indeed this is what most clients will put in there. I don't
think this is insignificant. It is completely different from User-to-user in
ISDN, or, say, Subject: in SIP where there is no expectation at all.

In ISDN, if you have a so-called 'Special Arrangement' then you can supply
an identity which is passed transparently through the network - no checking,
nothing. Obviously, the user only supplies an identity if they do not want
anonymity. But even if they do supply an identity, if the *subscriber* has
requested anonymity, then it is removed by the network.

Sounds pretty analogous to From: to me.

Analogous to Calling Party Number within the network, and when delivered to

I think many service providers will wish to do the same, and indeed this
checking is required in 3GPP. The situation is much clearer in this case,
because in order to access the service at all, the user MUST insert their
true identity (or 'anonymous') into the From: field.

So, although it is the user's equipment which *physically* puts in the
information, it is the service which is responsible for this information
being there. The Service Provider clearly has a responibility to remove that
information (or reject the session) if the subscriber has requested that it
not be present.

Rejecting the session and requesting the UA to re-try with 'anonymous' would
be great, but it doesn't work with RFC2543 clients and requires a double
attempt for session establishment, which is not good for wireless.

So, in this case I think the Service Provider *will* need to have the
capability to remove this information. They will need a B2BUA as described

Mike,
 
When I said 'future work', the future could be very soon. I said it on
Friday, so it could even be today :-) We have a charter item for a more
general privacy mechanism and this could be included within that.
 
Regarding 'subscriber' this is a key point about the Service Provider model.
Whenever you have a Service Provider, then there is a 'subscriber' who is
the person (legal or natural) who has contracted with the Service Provider
for the provision of the service. (I am leaving out the case where the
Service Provider offers service to just anyone for free, so there is no
contract as such).
 
At least in Europe, if the service is a 'Publically available
telecommunications service' (note that's 'telecommunications' not
'telephony'), then the subscriber has a right under Data Protection for all
calls made via their subscription to be anonymous if they so choose.
 
The most common example is where the subscriber is a company and the users
are its employees.
 
Another example of a person who is not represented by a 'User Agent' in SIP
terms during a session invokation is someone who has set their Home Proxy to
forward calls (using CPL or whatever). When a call is made, the
forwarding-party is represented only by their Proxy - their UA may not even
be connected to the network. Again, this person has a right for their
Personal Data to not be revealed by the Service Provider, so if the Service
Provider is responsible for the insertion of any such data in the messaging,
they need to capability to remove it again.
 
Regards...Mark

Mike, 

My suggestion of a generic mechanism to carry Personal Data was targetting
at future work, not the present privacy draft.



Yes, I suspected that, but then I noticed that Tom picked up on it as an
"very interesting idea " and seemed to be suggesting that we run with it. 




Two points: 
1) It's not just about privacy for the calling user - that's relatively
easy, you just need a mechanism to 'privately' pass information to trusted
network entities and apart from that it's up to the UA what it does/doesn't
reveal. The big problem is when other people are involved who do not have an
'agent' representing them. A subscriber to a public service is an example.
These people have rights which only the Service Provider knows about. The
Service Provider cannot be responsible for sending Personal Data of the
subscriber to the called party. Unfortunately the identity of the calling
user can often include personal data of the subscriber. 

2) You said 'If the user voluntarily includes it, it's not private'. Sure,
it's not private *as far as the user is concerned*. But it might be private
with respect to other people. So the question is who was *responsible* for
sending it. If it's entirely the user then no problem - same as if it's the
first thing the user says after Answer. The problem is that To/From are a
grey area, since the SIP spec clearly intends that they contain the
calling/called identities (as would a spec for
'What-I-Want-You-To-Call-Me'). A network based subscriber privacy service
which did not modify the From field would be pretty rubbish, whereas one
which did not modify the Subject would probably be fine. 




I'm confused by what you are getting at by "subscribers" and "other people"
(who don't have an "agent"), and "calling user". There is a SIP phone
(containing a "User Agent") and it might be used by multiple people to place
calls. If people don't have their own identity, then every call must use the
identity of the physical device. If there is a capability for each person to
provide a separate identity, then that is what is used by the "network" as
the basis for a "subscription" to service and to apply privacy. 

If you are referring to the complicated cases of how to apply "privacy" to
identities involved in 3-way services such as call transfer and call
forwarding, then I understand the difficulties, having been through
excrutiating discussions in standards development for ISDN. It isn't easy or
pretty. But these issues will only be worked out in a specific discusion of
the interworking of the identity/privacy service with the call transfer/call
forwarding services, something that the IETF is intent on not doing. 

I still say if the user voluntarily includes something beyond the specific
identity fields, then the network has no obligation to apply privacy to it.
I don't see a case in which the network has to do anything else to provide
privacy for "other people". Again, maybe there is a difference in what
"user" refers to in your point 2) above. If the "standard" service operation
(in the User Agent or network) puts in some identity, or passes along one it
got during Call Transfer, then of course privacy rules must apply to it.
That's not the user (person) voluntarily putting in the information. 

Mike

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol Extension for Instant 
                          Messaging
	Author(s)	: B. Campbell, J. Rosenberg et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-message-02.txt
	Pages		: 19
	Date		: 12-Apr-02
	
Instant Messageing (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between
users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not
required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode,
that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for
participants to maintain an interactive conversation.
The MESSAGE method is an extension to the Session Initation Protocol
(SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  MESSAGE requests
carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests
do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each
Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE
requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some
other SIP request.
Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP it inherits all the
request routing and security features of that protocol.

Isn't there a mechanism whereby both UAs get back to an agreed 
state? How can the negotiation process continue properly 
otherwise?

Hi all,
regarding the discussion what SIP Header fits to what ISUP Parameter we should know what rules apply to the interworking from SIP to ISUP. From my understanding (of the last ITU discussion in Geneva) the following rules shall apply  to the mapping of the From and Remote Party ID to ISUP parameters:
....
Note: From: is mandatory and always checked for presence.
Case-a: If RPID is absent, then do the following:
1) Additional CgPN is derived from From: (Note Jesske:because it is user provided but not verified by the service provider)
2) CgPN is assigned with Network Generated Number. (Note Jesske: with a screening indication: network provided)
 
Case-b: If RPID is present and RPI-Screen="Yes", then do the following:
1) Additional CgPN is derived from From: (Note Jesske:because it is user provided but not verified by the service provider)
2) CgPN is derived from RPID: (Note Jesske: with a screening indication: user provided verified and passed )
 
Case-c: If RPID is present and RPI-Screen="No", then do the following:
1) Additional CgPN is derived from RPID: (Note Jesske:because it is user provided but not verified by the service provider)
2) CgPN is assigned with Network Generated Number. (Note Jesske: with a screening indication: network provided)
....
The interest of big Service Provider/Carriers is to have an proper inteworking of SIP and ISUP, because the will have in future hybrid networks with SIP and ISUP (BICC) signalling. And the above mentioned rules are the first step forward for a proper interworking (my opinion) between SIP and ISUP including the CLIP/CLIR Service.

I hope this information fits in your discussion. 

Best Regards 

Roland

But not in the case raised by Juha, where the Service Provider checks the contents of the From field. Then these fields are more like the user-provided Calling Party Number field which is checked by the local exchange.

Even if the Service Provider does not do this checking, I would still argue that there is an implicit expectation that these fields contain indentity information, and indeed this is what most clients will put in there. I don't think this is insignificant. It is completely different from User-to-user in ISDN, or, say, Subject: in SIP where there is no expectation at all.

In ISDN, if you have a so-called 'Special Arrangement' then you can supply an identity which is passed transparently through the network - no checking, nothing. Obviously, the user only supplies an identity if they do not want anonymity. But even if they do supply an identity, if the *subscriber* has requested anonymity, then it is removed by the network.

Sounds pretty analogous to From: to me.

Analogous to Calling Party Number within the network, and when delivered to the Called party.

Well, it would if we agreed :-)

MessageYou pretty much have to assume that the receiving user sees
_anything_ you send his UA, except in the rare case where the user has no
control over the UA behavior. Asking a UAS to hide information from its
owner is not useful in the generic case.

I agree with Dean on this in general, although it really doesn't matter if
any _network_ inserted identification is there with the consent of the
originating user or not. A privacy request need _only_ apply to
network-inserted identification data. The UAC has every opportunity _not_ to
insert identification if it does not want to.

Expecting the network to screen out ID that _I_ provide is a slippery slope.
What if I put "call from Ben" in a Subject header? Do you screen that out as
well? What if I _tell_ the destination user who I am in an IM associated
with the call? What about the media session,?

  The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied

user-supplied information, such as the words I'm typing now. Anything I put
in my To or from field is deliberately and explicitly intended to be
delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if as a service
provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my data, and my lawyers
will be in touch!

  The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID) is NOT
inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE CONSENT of
the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the protection of that
information in a manner consistent with regulation and the expressed wishes
of the user.

  No, The CLIP is inserted by the network WITH THE CONSENT of the user. When
you subscribe a line from a PSTN service provider, the form you filled
indicating whether you want your telephone number to be PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
(of course, the default is PUBLIC if you leave it blank.) When you make a
call, the PRIVATE or PUBLIC status value is retrieved and set the Address
Presentation Restricted Indicator (APRI) field in SS7 environment (Note
that, CLIR toggles the values), then the terminating side of the network
based on the APRI value to determine whether the Calling Party Number shall
be delivered to the callee's CPE.

  Since we want to push the decision making to the UA, we should standardize
the rule such that the UA shall display the From information based on
Privacy indication. If we think that too many UAs won't follow this rule,
than we should allow the Service Provider of terminating side (not the
originating side) to alter the From information before terminating the call
to the UA based on the Privacy indication.

  This is my penny thought,

  Mark Chiou

if the call goes to pstn, the user gets calling number anonymity by
using Anonymous as the display string.  if the call goes to another sip
user, the same thing happens, but i must implement b2ua and rewrite the
from header.  no standardization is needed in order to accomplish this.

You chose the week of InterOp Las Vegas, plan on having the meeting *at* the
same location as that convention, and have really confirmed that there are
rooms available at the hotel attached to the convention center?!

Seems even if you've picked a location that does have the room, that you
couldn't have picked a more hectic week or place to have it in (except maybe
CES week in Januarys)...

Or was this a plan to have during InterOp?

Ben,
 
I know this is a long thread, but I have addressed all these points before.

You pretty much have to assume that the receiving user sees _anything_ you
send his UA, except in the rare case where the user has no control over the
UA behavior. Asking a UAS to hide information from its owner is not useful
in the generic case.
 
I agree with Dean on this in general, although it really doesn't matter if
any _network_ inserted identification is there with the consent of the
originating user or not. A privacy request need _only_ apply to
network-inserted identification data. The UAC has every opportunity _not_ to
insert identification if it does not want to. 

It doesn't matter what device inserts the information. It matters whether it
is part of the service for the information to be inserted. If it is a part
of the service, then the responsibility lies with the Service Provider -
they defined the service and they are responsible for things the users do
effectively at their behest.
 
If I check the From: field I receive from my users is valid, then I am
forcing them to put either their identity or 'Anonymous' in there.
 
If there is then a privacy requirement arising from the rights of ANOTHER
PERSON, NOT THE USER, then I have to do something about this - I as the
Service Provider have the responsibility, not the user. An example is when
the *subscriber* has requested anonymity.
 
If I let my users use any old From value, then the situation is not so
clear, but I still argue that for fields whose intention is defined for
transport of a particular identity, then the Service Provider has some
responsibility. (cf Special Arrangements in the ISDN).

Expecting the network to screen out ID that _I_ provide is a slippery slope.
What if I put "call from Ben" in a Subject header? Do you screen that out as
well? What if I _tell_ the destination user who I am in an IM associated
with the call? What about the media session,? 
 

Personally, I don't think screening out the Subject would be necessary,
although there might be some market demand for services which did this.
Subject is a genuinely transparent field. There is no intention that it
contain your identity, and UAs are unlikely to insert your identity here
automatically.
 
...Mark

The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied

delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if as a service
provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my data, and my lawyers
will be in touch!
 
The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID) is NOT
inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE CONSENT of
the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the protection of that
information in a manner consistent with regulation and the expressed wishes
of the user.
<snip>
 ##########################################################
No, The CLIP is inserted by the network WITH THE CONSENT of the user. When
you subscribe a line from a PSTN service provider, the form you filled
indicating whether you want your telephone number to be PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
(of course, the default is PUBLIC if you leave it blank.) When you make a
call, the PRIVATE or PUBLIC status value is retrieved and set the Address
Presentation Restricted Indicator (APRI) field in SS7 environment (Note
that, CLIR toggles the values), then the terminating side of the network
based on the APRI value to determine whether the Calling Party Number shall
be delivered to the callee's CPE.
 
Since we want to push the decision making to the UA, we should standardize
the rule such that the UA shall display the From information based on
Privacy indication. If we think that too many UAs won't follow this rule,
than we should allow the Service Provider of terminating side (not the
originating side) to alter the From information before terminating the call
to the UA based on the Privacy indication.
 
This is my penny thought,
 
Mark Chiou

I have heard many contributors assert that to get real anonymity, one
will have to use a relay, e.g. an "anonymizing B2BUA". I would like to
point out a failure in this line of reasoning: anonymizing relays have
been tried before, for e-mail, and the experience was absolutely not
conclusive. In fact, two different kind of anonymizers have been tried:
free ones, that kept absolutely no record, and subscriber-based, which
kept some records. Both have failed, for different reason.

The failure mode of a completely free relay is basically spam, and
similar sort of abuse. There is documentation available on the fate for
example of the cypherpunk experiment: this set of relays was set up to
provide true anonymity on the Internet, using a sophisticated mix of
random redirection and cryptography. In theory, the design was
excellent. In practice, the system was quickly overwhelmed by porn
traffic, and the relays dropped one by one out of the system because
they could not bear the resulting congestion.

Subscriber based relays are relays that keep some state: they actually
identify the sender, before washing out the identity in the outgoing
message. They are more robust to congestion, since they can get some
funding in the process, but they have a different failure mode: lawsuit.
Since they keep some records, the records can be subpoenaed, and the
provider can be forced to disclose the identity of the sending party. In
fact, in many codes, if the providers refuse to do so, they may be
deemed an accomplice of whatever action was carried out in the anonymous
exchange. Many providers have chosen to close their doors rather than
have to defend more lawsuit -- often after a brush with the Church of
Scientology.

If we really want practical anonymity, it has to be based on the UA, and
it should not rely on the help of a third party. We should use a
combination of encryption, pre-paid subscriptions, and anonymous IP
addresses (e.g. IPv6 privacy addresses.)

Juha,

I am not arguing that standardisation is required. I believe the necessary
capabilities can be provided with a B2BUA as described by Jonathan and
yourself (or something between a proxy and a full B2BUA).

I am arguing against the belief that there is NEVER a requirement for the
network to modify fields like From/To. It is this belief that has led other
people to distust these fields and specify that no information should be
included.

The worry is that if you allow potentially private information into those
fields, then this will cause trouble because there is an assumption/belief
at large in the SIP community that these fields should never be modified.

If we could agree that it is at least _likely_ that privacy services which
modify From/To will be required by Public Service providers, there would be
no more reason to distruct the fields and we could all use them for their
intended purpose.

...Mark

Christian,

If you want to provide complete unassailable anonymity, I agree completely.
I have been arguing about providing a similar level of anonymity as the
PSTN, where the called party is not informed who the call is from by the
service itself. It's more about Data Protection than strict anonymity.

In the PSTN there is no problem for certain authorised organisations
(including the courts) to obtain the details of the call from the Service
Providers if they have good reason. Data Protection does not protect you
against these organisations.

...Mark

i don't see any slippery slope here.  if you tell in the data part of
the message or call, who you are, then it is up to you.  the only thing
i care is that if the user in the from header claims to be someone that
someone has to be someone we have agreed for the subscription.

MessageYes, it is a long thread :-)

I pretty much agree with your original assessment for when the network
authenticates From, although I would propose a better behavior would be to
just disallow a request with a non-anonymous From header _and_ with privacy
requested. This approach is more backwards compatible (in case something
involved still freaks out about modified From headers), and a lot simpler to
implement in the network (no B2BUA required, at least for _this_ reason)

But in general, the requirement that a network must prevent a badly behaved
client from revealing its identity accidentally seems a bit excessive. It
should be sufficient to say that a client _can_ prevent its identity from
being revealed.

  Ben,

  I know this is a long thread, but I have addressed all these points
before. Please see below...

    You pretty much have to assume that the receiving user sees _anything_
you send his UA, except in the rare case where the user has no control over
the UA behavior. Asking a UAS to hide information from its owner is not
useful in the generic case.

    I agree with Dean on this in general, although it really doesn't matter
if any _network_ inserted identification is there with the consent of the
originating user or not. A privacy request need _only_ apply to
network-inserted identification data. The UAC has every opportunity _not_ to
insert identification if it does not want to.
  It doesn't matter what device inserts the information. It matters whether
it is part of the service for the information to be inserted. If it is a
part of the service, then the responsibility lies with the Service
Provider - they defined the service and they are responsible for things the
users do effectively at their behest.

  If I check the From: field I receive from my users is valid, then I am
forcing them to put either their identity or 'Anonymous' in there.

  If there is then a privacy requirement arising from the rights of ANOTHER
PERSON, NOT THE USER, then I have to do something about this - I as the
Service Provider have the responsibility, not the user. An example is when
the *subscriber* has requested anonymity.

  If I let my users use any old From value, then the situation is not so
clear, but I still argue that for fields whose intention is defined for
transport of a particular identity, then the Service Provider has some
responsibility. (cf Special Arrangements in the ISDN).
    Expecting the network to screen out ID that _I_ provide is a slippery
slope. What if I put "call from Ben" in a Subject header? Do you screen that
out as well? What if I _tell_ the destination user who I am in an IM
associated with the call? What about the media session,?

  Personally, I don't think screening out the Subject would be necessary,
although there might be some market demand for services which did this.
Subject is a genuinely transparent field. There is no intention that it
contain your identity, and UAs are unlikely to insert your identity here
automatically.

      The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied
information. The Service Provider doesn't insert them, inspect them, or have
any responsibility for them. Insisting that the service provider change them
is just like insisting that the service provider change any other
user-supplied information, such as the words I'm typing now. Anything I put
in my To or from field is deliberately and explicitly intended to be
delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if as a service
provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my data, and my lawyers
will be in touch!

      The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID) is
NOT inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE CONSENT
of the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the protection of that
information in a manner consistent with regulation and the expressed wishes
of the user.
      <snip>
       ##########################################################
      No, The CLIP is inserted by the network WITH THE CONSENT of the user.
When you subscribe a line from a PSTN service provider, the form you filled
indicating whether you want your telephone number to be PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
(of course, the default is PUBLIC if you leave it blank.) When you make a
call, the PRIVATE or PUBLIC status value is retrieved and set the Address
Presentation Restricted Indicator (APRI) field in SS7 environment (Note
that, CLIR toggles the values), then the terminating side of the network
based on the APRI value to determine whether the Calling Party Number shall
be delivered to the callee's CPE.

      Since we want to push the decision making to the UA, we should
standardize the rule such that the UA shall display the From information
based on Privacy indication. If we think that too many UAs won't follow this
rule, than we should allow the Service Provider of terminating side (not the
originating side) to alter the From information before terminating the call
to the UA based on the Privacy indication.

      This is my penny thought,

      Mark Chiou

Rejecting non-anonymous requests when anonymity is required is all very
well, but a 2543 client will not know what to do in order to get its call
through. It will require user intervention. For every call. How will the
user know when anonymity is required ? The user does not want to be forced
into anonymity unless absolutely necessary, so they will always try
non-anonymous first.
 
It's not a question of 'badly behaved clients'. The client is well-behaved
and following the users instructions to be 'non-anonymous' - sure, the
client can prevent its identity being revealed, but the user does not want
this. The SUBSCRIBER wants anonymity, not the user.
 
You could standardise a way of communicating the subscriber's wishes to the
UA, and then enforce them. But how does this work for a forwarding user (or
their subscriber) who does not wish to be identified ?

Yes, it is a long thread :-)
 
I pretty much agree with your original assessment for when the network
authenticates From, although I would propose a better behavior would be to
just disallow a request with a non-anonymous From header _and_ with privacy
requested. This approach is more backwards compatible (in case something
involved still freaks out about modified From headers), and a lot simpler to
implement in the network (no B2BUA required, at least for _this_ reason)
 
But in general, the requirement that a network must prevent a badly behaved
client from revealing its identity accidentally seems a bit excessive. It
should be sufficient to say that a client _can_ prevent its identity from
being revealed.

Ben,
 
I know this is a long thread, but I have addressed all these points before.

You pretty much have to assume that the receiving user sees _anything_ you
send his UA, except in the rare case where the user has no control over the
UA behavior. Asking a UAS to hide information from its owner is not useful
in the generic case.
 
I agree with Dean on this in general, although it really doesn't matter if
any _network_ inserted identification is there with the consent of the
originating user or not. A privacy request need _only_ apply to
network-inserted identification data. The UAC has every opportunity _not_ to
insert identification if it does not want to. 

It doesn't matter what device inserts the information. It matters whether it
is part of the service for the information to be inserted. If it is a part
of the service, then the responsibility lies with the Service Provider -
they defined the service and they are responsible for things the users do
effectively at their behest.
 
If I check the From: field I receive from my users is valid, then I am
forcing them to put either their identity or 'Anonymous' in there.
 
If there is then a privacy requirement arising from the rights of ANOTHER
PERSON, NOT THE USER, then I have to do something about this - I as the
Service Provider have the responsibility, not the user. An example is when
the *subscriber* has requested anonymity.
 
If I let my users use any old From value, then the situation is not so
clear, but I still argue that for fields whose intention is defined for
transport of a particular identity, then the Service Provider has some
responsibility. (cf Special Arrangements in the ISDN).

Expecting the network to screen out ID that _I_ provide is a slippery slope.
What if I put "call from Ben" in a Subject header? Do you screen that out as
well? What if I _tell_ the destination user who I am in an IM associated
with the call? What about the media session,? 
 

Personally, I don't think screening out the Subject would be necessary,
although there might be some market demand for services which did this.
Subject is a genuinely transparent field. There is no intention that it
contain your identity, and UAs are unlikely to insert your identity here
automatically.

The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied
information. The Service Provider doesn't insert them, inspect them, or have
any responsibility for them. Insisting that the service provider change them
is just like insisting that the service provider change any other
user-supplied information, such as the words I'm typing now. Anything I put
in my To or from field is deliberately and explicitly intended to be
delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if as a service
provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my data, and my lawyers
will be in touch!
 
The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID) is NOT
inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE CONSENT of
the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the protection of that
information in a manner consistent with regulation and the expressed wishes
of the user.
<snip>
 ##########################################################
No, The CLIP is inserted by the network WITH THE CONSENT of the user. When
you subscribe a line from a PSTN service provider, the form you filled
indicating whether you want your telephone number to be PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
(of course, the default is PUBLIC if you leave it blank.) When you make a
call, the PRIVATE or PUBLIC status value is retrieved and set the Address
Presentation Restricted Indicator (APRI) field in SS7 environment (Note
that, CLIR toggles the values), then the terminating side of the network
based on the APRI value to determine whether the Calling Party Number shall
be delivered to the callee's CPE.
 
Since we want to push the decision making to the UA, we should standardize
the rule such that the UA shall display the From information based on
Privacy indication. If we think that too many UAs won't follow this rule,
than we should allow the Service Provider of terminating side (not the
originating side) to alter the From information before terminating the call
to the UA based on the Privacy indication.
 
This is my penny thought,

I don't believe anyone has suggested (I hope) that the receiving user's UA 
should be responsible for hiding the information. It is always the last 
"trusted" entity which must do this, i.e., the "service provider" in Mark 
Chiou's comments. The exception, of course, might be when the terminating UA 
is also "trusted" by the service provider, but I'm not sure of a good example 
of this. The terminating UA would then be like an extension of the "Service 
Provider".

I believe that every identification inserted must be "with consent" of the 
originating user, either explicitly by user action, or implicitly by the fact 
that they made a phone call. And no, a privacy request does not only apply to 
network-inserted identifcation data. (Compare to the ISDN case in which the 
originating user inserts their phone number and also indicates that it is to 
be kept private, i.e., not delivered to the other user. The network verifies 
it and passes it through their trusted network or to another trusted network. 
The requirement in SIP is not different.)

Just to confuse the issue a little more, maybe I should remind everyone at 
this point, that, at least in the US, when the originator says their identity 
should be kept private, it is still delivered at the other end for an "800" 
call. Also, some years ago, Florida created special office codes to override 
the originator's privacy desire when calls terminated to those special office 
codes. I don't know if that stupid capability still exists in Florida.

And no, the UAC does not have the opportunity to not insert an identification 
if the "Service Provider" requires it as a prerequisite for service.

Providing an ID in a field defined for that prupose (for the benefit of the 
network and required trace) and have the network "screen" it is not a 
slippary slope. It is exactly what must be done and is straight forward.

I hope we have agreed across the board that the network would never screen 
the contents of other fields such as the Subject header.

I wasn't speaking of "anticipating regulation" but rather current legislation 
that will eventually applied to SIP-based telephony whenever someone wants to 
sell a regular telephony service using SIP in place of what is currently 
provided over circuit switched technology. It will take a very simple action 
by a state utility commission to declare that its rules for circuit switched 
also must apply to packet-based telephony. It would be foolish to ignore this 
eventuality.

Just like the law today for FAX (in the US) - every call must be identified 
with the source. Yes, I suspect that this will become required for SIP, not 
necessarily by law, but by any responsible service provider as a prerequisite 
for setting up a session.

That's always been the prime motivator for me, plus the secondary use of
NAI for call return to an anonymous caller.

  Rejecting non-anonymous requests when anonymity is required is all very
well, but a 2543 client will not know what to do in order to get its call
through. It will require user intervention. For every call. How will the
user know when anonymity is required ? The user does not want to be forced
into anonymity unless absolutely necessary, so they will always try
non-anonymous first.

  I'm not sure how a 2543 client will know how to request privacy in the
first place. And I assume that a user knows whether or not he wishes to make
an anonymous call. I cannot think of a _technical_ solution for helping a
user decide if a call should be anonymous or not.

   It's not a question of 'badly behaved clients'. The client is
well-behaved and following the users instructions to be 'non-anonymous' -
sure, the client can prevent its identity being revealed, but the user does
not want this. The SUBSCRIBER wants anonymity, not the user.

  I'm not sure what you mean--who is the subscriber, if not the user (i.e.
the person trying to place an anonymous call)?  (This may be the source of
my confusion in the previous paragraph. I was using the term "user" and
"subscriber" interchangeably.)

  You could standardise a way of communicating the subscriber's wishes to
the UA, and then enforce them. But how does this work for a forwarding user
(or their subscriber) who does not wish to be identified ?

  Presumadly if a UA supports anonymous calling, it must give the subscriber
some way of expressing the desire to do so. I don't see any need to
standardize that. Once the subscriber expresses that desire, it is up to the
UA to do things right (like, don't _automatically_ put user identifiable
information in headers, From or otherwise.)  A UA that pretends to support
anonymity but screws it up fits my definition of "badly behaved."

    Yes, it is a long thread :-)

    I pretty much agree with your original assessment for when the network
authenticates From, although I would propose a better behavior would be to
just disallow a request with a non-anonymous From header _and_ with privacy
requested. This approach is more backwards compatible (in case something
involved still freaks out about modified From headers), and a lot simpler to
implement in the network (no B2BUA required, at least for _this_ reason)

    But in general, the requirement that a network must prevent a badly
behaved client from revealing its identity accidentally seems a bit
excessive. It should be sufficient to say that a client _can_ prevent its
identity from being revealed.

      Ben,

      I know this is a long thread, but I have addressed all these points
before. Please see below...

        You pretty much have to assume that the receiving user sees
_anything_ you send his UA, except in the rare case where the user has no
control over the UA behavior. Asking a UAS to hide information from its
owner is not useful in the generic case.

        I agree with Dean on this in general, although it really doesn't
matter if any _network_ inserted identification is there with the consent of
the originating user or not. A privacy request need _only_ apply to
network-inserted identification data. The UAC has every opportunity _not_ to
insert identification if it does not want to.
      It doesn't matter what device inserts the information. It matters
whether it is part of the service for the information to be inserted. If it
is a part of the service, then the responsibility lies with the Service
Provider - they defined the service and they are responsible for things the
users do effectively at their behest.

      If I check the From: field I receive from my users is valid, then I am
forcing them to put either their identity or 'Anonymous' in there.

      If there is then a privacy requirement arising from the rights of
ANOTHER PERSON, NOT THE USER, then I have to do something about this - I as
the Service Provider have the responsibility, not the user. An example is
when the *subscriber* has requested anonymity.

      If I let my users use any old From value, then the situation is not so
clear, but I still argue that for fields whose intention is defined for
transport of a particular identity, then the Service Provider has some
responsibility. (cf Special Arrangements in the ISDN).
        Expecting the network to screen out ID that _I_ provide is a
slippery slope. What if I put "call from Ben" in a Subject header? Do you
screen that out as well? What if I _tell_ the destination user who I am in
an IM associated with the call? What about the media session,?

      Personally, I don't think screening out the Subject would be
necessary, although there might be some market demand for services which did
this. Subject is a genuinely transparent field. There is no intention that
it contain your identity, and UAs are unlikely to insert your identity here
automatically.

          The point I'm trying to make is that To and From are USER supplied
information. The Service Provider doesn't insert them, inspect them, or have
any responsibility for them. Insisting that the service provider change them
is just like insisting that the service provider change any other
user-supplied information, such as the words I'm typing now. Anything I put
in my To or from field is deliberately and explicitly intended to be
delivered to the terminating side of the dialog, and if as a service
provider you FAIL to do that, then you have DAMAGED my data, and my lawyers
will be in touch!

          The calling-party-identity presentation infromation (CLIP or RPID)
is NOT inserted by the user. It is inserted by the network, WITHOUT THE
CONSENT of the user. As such, the operator is responsible for the protection
of that information in a manner consistent with regulation and the expressed
wishes of the user.
          <snip>
           ##########################################################
          No, The CLIP is inserted by the network WITH THE CONSENT of the
user. When you subscribe a line from a PSTN service provider, the form you
filled indicating whether you want your telephone number to be PUBLIC or
PRIVATE. (of course, the default is PUBLIC if you leave it blank.) When you
make a call, the PRIVATE or PUBLIC status value is retrieved and set the
Address Presentation Restricted Indicator (APRI) field in SS7 environment
(Note that, CLIR toggles the values), then the terminating side of the
network based on the APRI value to determine whether the Calling Party
Number shall be delivered to the callee's CPE.

          Since we want to push the decision making to the UA, we should
standardize the rule such that the UA shall display the From information
based on Privacy indication. If we think that too many UAs won't follow this
rule, than we should allow the Service Provider of terminating side (not the
originating side) to alter the From information before terminating the call
to the UA based on the Privacy indication.

          This is my penny thought,

OK, so lets see if we can conclude on _short-term_ Network Asserted identity
requirements in a separate thread. Follow-ups to SIPPING ONLY please.

First, assume a trust domain model as per privacy draft applicability
statement. Entities within a domain trust each other, entities in different
domains are mutually untrusted.

I'll try to build up the requirements, least contraversial first:
NAI1) The ability for network entities to insert a network asserted identity
and pass to other network entities within the same trust domain.
NAI2) The ability for a network entity to pass a (non-private) network
asserted identity directly to a UA
NAI3) Secure transport of network asserted identity across 'untrusted'
networks back to the same trust domain (including between trust 'islands' -
disconnected parts of a single trust domain)
NAI4) Transport of network asserted identity between trust domains (i.e.
transport in one domain of a network asserted identity received from another
domain)

For clarity, 
(a) the requirement for a user to choose one of a number of identities,
whilst retaining privacy, is a 3GPP requirement, but is *out of scope* of
this thread.
(b) Call Trace implemented by encrypting the identity and passing this to
the called user, who can then pass the encrypted identity to the generating
service provider/authorities, is considered a sub-case of NAI3 - the
identity is passed to the 'untrusted' user and back to the original Trust
Domain (the Service Provider) before being passed to the authorities.

I expect the From/To debate will continue, probably to the end of time, but
I don't see a strong relationship with this issue.

If people agree with my statement of the potential requirements, perhaps we
could open discussion on which of these should be considered for immediate
standardisation. The others can be put into the pot for discussion of the
generic privacy requirements.

For my part, I am most concerned about NAI1 and NAI2.

Regards...Mark

<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>OK, so lets see if we can conclude on _short-term_ =
Network Asserted identity requirements in a separate thread. Follow-ups =
to SIPPING ONLY please.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>First, assume a trust domain model as per privacy =
draft applicability statement. Entities within a domain trust each =
other, entities in different domains are mutually untrusted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I'll try to build up the requirements, least =
contraversial first:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>NAI1) The ability for network entities to insert a =
network asserted identity and pass to other network entities within the =
same trust domain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>NAI2) The ability for a network entity to pass a =
(non-private) network asserted identity directly to a UA</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>NAI3) Secure transport of network asserted identity =
across 'untrusted' networks back to the same trust domain (including =
between trust 'islands' - disconnected parts of a single trust =
domain)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>NAI4) Transport of network asserted identity between =
trust domains (i.e. transport in one domain of a network asserted =
identity received from another domain)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>For clarity, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>(a) the requirement for a user to choose one of a =
number of identities, whilst retaining privacy, is a 3GPP requirement, =
but is *out of scope* of this thread.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>(b) Call Trace implemented by encrypting the identity =
and passing this to the called user, who can then pass the encrypted =
identity to the generating service provider/authorities, is considered =
a sub-case of NAI3 - the identity is passed to the 'untrusted' user and =
back to the original Trust Domain (the Service Provider) before being =
passed to the authorities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I expect the From/To debate will continue, probably =
to the end of time, but I don't see a strong relationship with this =
issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>If people agree with my statement of the potential =
requirements, perhaps we could open discussion on which of these should =
be considered for immediate standardisation. The others can be put into =
the pot for discussion of the generic privacy requirements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>For my part, I am most concerned about NAI1 and =
NAI2.</FONT>

MessageOK, in that case I would expect the subscriber profile to have an
optional entry indicating that only anonymous calls were allowed. If some
user (the subscriber or otherwise) then tries to make a non-anonymous call,
it gets rejected.

It also makes sense that a well crafted UA that supported anonymous calling
would have an option to always be anonymous, to avoid the usual cycle of try
non-anonymous, fail, then try again with anonymous.

I don't see why this is any different than any other rejection due to a
policy violation.

Three problems:
1) In practice you might expect the 'policy' to be more flexible than just
'everything anonymous' (e.g. internal calls non-anonymous, external calls
anonymous), although the blanket anonymity would be the most that Service
Providers could be required to provide. Anyway, we do not want the only
solution to this requirement to be to configure the UA as always anonymous.
 
The users wish is that they be identified if possible. The 'policy' solution
means that the only way of finding out if a particular call must be
anonymous is to try and see, and then retry if it fails.
 
2) Even with a well-crafted UA, why is the _user_ expected to re-configure
their client because of the _subscriber's_ wishes. And when the policy
changes, how will we indicate to all the users that they should now
re-configure their clients again ?
 
I hope all the Service Providers wanting to launch SIP services have got
their list of client requirements worked out. If your subscriber asks for
this anonymity service they will not be impressed if they have to
upgrade/re-configure all their clients. If you didn't inform them in advance
that the clients needed these capabilities, then they could refuse to
upgrade and still demand the anonymity service.
 
3) What about a user who has asked their home proxy to forward calls, and
who wishes to remain anonymous - is the inclusion of this persons identity
in the To field just a policy violation ? How many UAs have an option to set
the To field blank ? This would be more of a 'call rejection' service than a
'call forwarding' service. I think that if in trying to get a Data Protected
version of a service, the user finds that they can't have the service at
all, they would be entitled to be a bit miffed.

OK, in that case I would expect the subscriber profile to have an optional
entry indicating that only anonymous calls were allowed. If some user (the
subscriber or otherwise) then tries to make a non-anonymous call, it gets
rejected.
 
It also makes sense that a well crafted UA that supported anonymous calling
would have an option to always be anonymous, to avoid the usual cycle of try
non-anonymous, fail, then try again with anonymous.
 
I don't see why this is any different than any other rejection due to a
policy violation.

  Three problems:
  1) In practice you might expect the 'policy' to be more flexible than just
'everything anonymous' (e.g. internal calls non-anonymous, external calls
anonymous), although the blanket anonymity would be the most that Service
Providers could be required to provide. Anyway, we do not want the only
solution to this requirement to be to configure the UA as always anonymous.

  Certainly not. I only meant this for the situation where the subscriber
has asserted that all calls from his account are to be anonymous, and an
individual user of that account might not know about that policy choice.

  The users wish is that they be identified if possible. The 'policy'
solution means that the only way of finding out if a particular call must be
anonymous is to try and see, and then retry if it fails.

  Which then allows the user to decide whether or not to continue according
to policy, or just not make the call. Otherwise, the network seems to be in
the business of deciding that the user really does not mind if the call is
anonymous. That seems fairly benign in this particular case, but not
generically (what if the policy was _no_ anonymous calls.)

  2) Even with a well-crafted UA, why is the _user_ expected to re-configure
their client because of the _subscriber's_ wishes. And when the policy
changes, how will we indicate to all the users that they should now
re-configure their clients again ?

  They don't have to. Doing so just cuts down on the
reject-due-to-policy-violation-oops-retry cycles. Now, I assume the user
must have some relationship with the subscriber (else how does he have
credentials), and the subscriber _could_ just tell the user. Not everything
has to be automatic.

  I hope all the Service Providers wanting to launch SIP services have got
their list of client requirements worked out. If your subscriber asks for
this anonymity service they will not be impressed if they have to
upgrade/re-configure all their clients. If you didn't inform them in advance
that the clients needed these capabilities, then they could refuse to
upgrade and still demand the anonymity service.

  Well, once the idea of an anonymity service is fully formed (presumably
what we are doing here) it makes sense that it is a feature that a client
can support or not support. (Maybe even a supported or requires tag?) Then
it is reasonable for a service provider to say you can make anonymous calls
if your client supports anonymity. If a subscriber has a policy of _only_
anonymous calls, and a user has a client that cannot make anonymous calls,
then he is SOL.  I don't see why this is any different than any _other_
situation where an optional client feature might be required by SP or
subscriber policy. Again, the alternative is a presumption on the networks
part that it knows what the user _really_ means to do better than the user
does. Such an presumption on policy violations scares me in the generic
sense.

  3) What about a user who has asked their home proxy to forward calls, and
who wishes to remain anonymous - is the inclusion of this persons identity
in the To field just a policy violation ? How many UAs have an option to set
the To field blank ? This would be more of a 'call rejection' service than a
'call forwarding' service. I think that if in trying to get a Data Protected
version of a service, the user finds that they can't have the service at
all, they would be entitled to be a bit miffed.

No, The CLIP is inserted by the network WITH THE CONSENT of the user.
When you subscribe a line from a PSTN service provider, the form you
filled indicating whether you want your telephone number to be PUBLIC or
PRIVATE. (of course, the default is PUBLIC if you leave it blank.) When
you make a call, the PRIVATE or PUBLIC status value is retrieved and set
the Address Presentation Restricted Indicator (APRI) field in SS7
environment (Note that, CLIR toggles the values), then the terminating
side of the network based on the APRI value to determine whether the
Calling Party Number shall be delivered to the callee's CPE. 
----

Coercion <=> consent.

There is no explicit consent within the signaling of an invidiual
transaction. External contractual issues are outside of the protocol,
and tend to violate the "openness" characteristic of an Internet
protocol. In otherwises, there's a philosophical difference between an
explicit request from the user that a network providing break privacy
for that transaction, and a network that breaks privacy just because I
didn't tell it NOT to.

Note of course, that we're not talking about PSTN provoders, we're
talking IP to IP usage over the publicaly addressable Internet.


Mark also wrote:
----
Since we want to push the decision making to the UA, we should
standardize the rule such that the UA shall display the From information
based on Privacy indication. If we think that too many UAs won't follow
this rule, than we should allow the Service Provider of terminating side
(not the originating side) to alter the From information before
terminating the call to the UA based on the Privacy indication.
----

Personally, the UA I uset he most writes every last SIP header and the
body to the screen, and copies them all to a log file just in case. One
cannot rely on the called party's software to protect the privacy of the
calling party.

Coercion <=> consent.

There is no explicit consent within the signaling of an invidiual
transaction. External contractual issues are outside of the protocol,
and tend to violate the "openness" characteristic of an Internet
protocol. In otherwises, there's a philosophical difference between an
explicit request from the user that a network providing break privacy
for that transaction, and a network that breaks privacy just because I
didn't tell it NOT to.

Note of course, that we're not talking about PSTN provoders, we're
talking IP to IP usage over the publicaly addressable Internet.

<Mark Chiou> So, for IP, all the UAs are defaulted to PRIVATE. When a user wishes to make an anonymous calls, SIP needs an indication for the network (i.e. Service Provider) to identify who is calling and translate or retrieve the identity of the calling from the service agreement, then pass the calling identity within the networks without sending the calling identity to the UA of the called party.   

<snip>

Personally, the UA I uset he most writes every last SIP header and the
body to the screen, and copies them all to a log file just in case. One
cannot rely on the called party's software to protect the privacy of the
calling party.
 
<Mark Chiou> Agree. So we have to separate the needs for Privacy and the needs for Network, such that the privacy is fully controlled by the UA. On the other hand, the Service Providers have the responsibility to obtain the UA's identify for network usage (i.e. Emergency, Law Enforcement, Call trace, and etc) without breaking the UA's privacy. I means the UA's identity, which is needed by the Network, shall not be delivered to the terminating of the UA.

i don't understand why we would need anything new for this kind of
privacy purpose.

we already have the Anonymous display string.  if th user wants from
privacy, it uses Anonymous display string from which the sip/ss7 gw
knows what to do.  the same to the other direction.

if the call goes to a sip user, then the network MUST rewrite the from
uri and thus implement a b2bua.

According to draft-ietf-sip-isup-03.txt

"  The construction of the From field is dependent on the presence of a
   CIN parameter. If the CIN is not present, then the gateway should
   create a dummy From header containing a SIP URI without a user
   portion which communicates only the hostname of the gateway (e.g.
   'sip:gw.level3.net')."

This works fine in case of a GW-GW scenario as the originating GW will
send only the IP Address in the From field and the terminating GW will
remove the IP Address before sending the CIN to the SCN network.

But in case the call lands on a SIP terminal from Gateway then From field will
not reflect the calling party who is the subscriber of GW, rather the SIP
terminal might just display the IP Address of the GW as the calling party
number on the user's screen.

So Wouldn't it be better to add  sip:Anonymous<restricted@gw.level3.net> ?
This way the SIP User will display the display name as Anonymous.
But ofcourse, a limitation of this will be in the GW-GW scenario, the
terminating
GW might map it to CIN presentation restricted while sending it to the SCN n/w.

Any suggestions??

Bishista Paul

Why would you trust the UA to obey this ? How could you police this if the
calling UA is getting service through a difefrent service provider from the

A 'no anonymous calls' policy would be in breach of the users right to make
anonymous calls. It is not the network that is deciding that the user does
not mind if the call is anonymous, it is the subscriber, and they have a
legal right to do this. The subscribe must be able to control what
information the network reveals about them. The user does not have the right
to ask the network to reveal information that the subscriber does not want
revealed - although the use can of course reveal the information themselves.

2) Even with a well-crafted UA, why is the _user_ expected to re-configure
their client because of the _subscriber's_ wishes. And when the policy
changes, how will we indicate to all the users that they should now
re-configure their clients again ? 
 
They don't have to. Doing so just cuts down on the
reject-due-to-policy-violation-oops-retry cycles. Now, I assume the user
must have some relationship with the subscriber (else how does he have
credentials), and the subscriber _could_ just tell the user. Not everything
has to be automatic. 

Frequent reject-due-to- policy-violation-oops-retry cycles are just
unaceptable for wireless environments. There must be a 'works first time'
solution. If you think the user needs to be informed that their call has
become anonymous, then fine, let's standardise this indication.

I hope all the Service Providers wanting to launch SIP services have got
their list of client requirements worked out. If your subscriber asks for
this anonymity service they will not be impressed if they have to
upgrade/re-configure all their clients. If you didn't inform them in advance
that the clients needed these capabilities, then they could refuse to
upgrade and still demand the anonymity service. 
 
Well, once the idea of an anonymity service is fully formed (presumably what
we are doing here) it makes sense that it is a feature that a client can
support or not support. (Maybe even a supported or requires tag?) Then it is
reasonable for a service provider to say you can make anonymous calls if
your client supports anonymity. If a subscriber has a policy of _only_
anonymous calls, and a user has a client that cannot make anonymous calls,
then he is SOL.  I don't see why this is any different than any _other_
situation where an optional client feature might be required by SP or
subscriber policy. Again, the alternative is a presumption on the networks
part that it knows what the user _really_ means to do better than the user
does. Such an presumption on policy violations scares me in the generic
sense.  

It's different because the 'subscriber policy' feature is not just a groovy
addition to the service, but something that the Service Provide must provide
for the subscriber 'by a simple means' (in the words of the European
legislation) by which they mean I make a phone call to my Service Provider
and ask. Upgrading possibly hundreds of clients might not be considered a
'simple means'.
 
Again, not a question of knowing what the user 'wants' - in this case the
subscribers wishe's overrule the users wishe's - we know the user wants to
reveal their identity but in this case the user is 'SOL'.

the current bis-09 text says:

The From header field allows for a display name. A UAC SHOULD use the
display name  Anonymous , along with a syntactically correct, but
otherwise meaningless URI (like sip:thisis@anonymous.invalid), if
the identity of the client is to remain hidden.

this is all that is needed except that in my service the uri must be
meaningful.

most UAs on the market support this.  so fail to see what the issue is.

------_=_NextPart_001_01C1E531.D9464E8A
Content-Type: text/plain

The client capability issue was for the case where the user does not wish to
remain anonymous, but the subscriber does.

Without a network modification of the From field then:

1) The user includes their identity, and the session is rejected. There is
no reject code which clearly indicates what action the user/UA should take.
There will be no current UAs which would know to auto-retry with
'Anonymous', so this will require user intervention on all calls.
Auto-retrys are no good for wireless anyway.

2) It was suggested that the client should have a 'always anonymous' option
which the user can set, so that all calls via this subscription will be
anonymous. Again, current clients may or may not have this, so relying on
this to provide the 'subscriber anonymity' service without the retrys of (1)
is not such a good idea unless you have clearly told subscribers - before
they subscribe - that such a capability is needed.

Service Providers need to be well aware of the client capabilities needed to
implement the regulatory services they have to provide, so that they can
make it clear to potential subscribers what those required client
capabilities are.

Even so, I really can't see all the above being realistic. Imagine a
subscriber goes to their service provider and requests anonymity. The first
thing that happens is that all calls through the subscription start failing
with some 'Privacy violation' response code. 'Oh sorry,' says the Service
Provider, 'but you asked for all calls to be anonymous and then carried on
trying to make non-anonymous calls. You'll need to tell all the users to
change their settings to anonymous'.

Whilst heamoraging money due to lost business, as none of their employees
can make calls, the subscriber makes the not unreasonable point that they
could tell all their users to switch to anonymous calls anyway, without
asking the Service Provider, so what is the point of their regulatory right
to an anonymity service ??

It has to work in a manner which is transparent and simple to the users and
subscriber. If you want a client-based solution to this service, then you
need to standardise a way of automatically informing & updating clients
about the subscription anonymity policy. Still doesn't work for forwarding
users.

The alternative is to accept that From/To modification in the network is
required to implement these services & no standardisation is required.

what is a subscriber and how does it differ from a user?  where is the

this whole hassle seems to originate from your subscriber business.  i
don't see any need to a subscriber that is not the same as the user.  is
this again some 3gpp thing?

as i said, most client that i have see do already have this "always
anonymous" option.  i don't see any need to complicate the sip specs for
those clients that don't because the implementation is trivial.

i have no problem with that.  already know we need to test the clients
and give recommendations to users.

this is no problem, because the user requests anonymity by using
Anonymous in the display string.  it is not a subscription option.  all
subscriptions look the same in this regard.

it makes no sense to try to emulate stupid pstn phones using with sip
UAs.  we can and should assume that a sip UA is a user configurable
beast.  therefore, the user itself can decide either permanently or on a
call by call basis if it wants anonymity or not.

as i have said, there is no such thing as subscription anonymity policy.

> what is a subscriber and how does it differ from a user?  where is the
> term subscriber defined?

This thread has been going for a while now, and as you said in the rest of
your message, the concept of a subscriber as separate from the user is
pretty important to the arguments, which is why I keep re-describing it. 

The subscriber is just one example of a person who has an interest in a
session who does not have a 'user agent' involved in the session to
represent them. My contention is that the easiest way to represent this
person in the session is through services in the network.

See
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg04720.html
for a description of why the subscriber is different from the user.

In terms of definition, the definition from the European Directive on Data
Protection intelecommunications (97/66/EC) says:

(a) 'subscriber` shall mean any natural or legal person who or which is
party to a contract with the provider of publicly available
telecommunications services for the supply of such services;
(b) 'user` shall mean any natural person using a publicly available
telecommunications service, for private or business purposes, without
necessarily having subscribed to this service;


There is a lot of information about this and data protection in
telecommunications in general at http://www.cdt.org/privacy/eudirective/

Finally, I just spotted that this directive is due to be replaced by a
revision which is explicitly intended to cover new technologies
http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/pdf/2000/en_500PC0385.pdf. I would not
advise any Service Provider to ignore this stuff.

Mark

i still fail to see the difference between a user and subscriber. in
order for the user to use my sip service, the user MUST first subscribe
the service.  the user may have any number of sip identities (uris)
associated with the subscription.

fine.

i don't understand what the above could mean.

 a user can't use my sip service without being first subscribed to it,
 i.e., the user must have a username and a password that identify a
 valid subscription.  i don't care who made the subscription, but in
 general it is a VERY bad idea to pass a given username/password to many
 people. if you do it then there is no way to figure out who actually
 made a call.

Hello Gonzalo,

Is there any project to create an internet-draft (or to update the existing
one) for the preconditions mechanism currently defined in the manyfolks
draft, but using SDPng (and so, XML based) ?

Thank you for your answer

Best regards
Juan Carlos

Hi Gonzalo,

Thank you very much, indeed this is compliant with the offer/answer draft.

Best regards

Hello Juan Carlos,

I have been thinking more about your scenario, and I think that sending
back in the first answer a c=0.0.0.0 line would be the right thing to
do.
This way, even though you have returned an answer with preconditions,
the other party will not perform resource reservation, since it does not
have an IP address to send media to.

Then, when you are ready to send an new offer, you will send it in an
UPDATE. The flow would look as follows:

                        INVITE (offer-1)
------------------------------------------------------------->
       183 (answer-to-offer-1, c=0.0.0.0)
<-------------------------------------------------------------
                             PRACK
------------------------------------------------------------->
                             200 PRACK
<-------------------------------------------------------------
                  UPDATE (offer-2)
<-------------------------------------------------------------
            200 UPDATE (answer-to-offer-2)
------------------------------------------------------------->

        <========== Resource Reservation ==========>

Best regards,

Gonzalo

Perhaps an example will help:

The subscriber is a company - the company has made a contract with you as
service provider for the provision of the service.

The user is an employee of the company - the user may be 'subscriber' in the
technical sense to your system, but they are not the subscriber as defined
in the definition below - they do not have any contract with you, the
contract is with the company.

If you insist on individual contracts with the employees of a company to
which you offer service, then you are equating user and subscriber, but I
doubt the company or its employees would be very happy with this mode of
operation.

Hi Gonzalo,

I don't want to open the debating again,

but this solution you provided assumes the QoS reservation protocol has to
use the IP address of both sides, it again reminds me about RSVP.

I thought we agreed that manyfolks is independent with any QoS reservation
protocol, therefore please don't provide solution on SIP level based on our
guessing on what happens IP level.

Thanks

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Extension for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts
	Author(s)	: D. Willis
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-path-03.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 15-Apr-02
	
The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate
a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact
is generally in the form of a URI, such as Contact:
&ltsip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and
associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.  The
problem is that network topology may be that there are one or more
SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any message
from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these
proxies.  The REGISTER method itself does not give us a mechanism to
discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for
future use.  This document defines an extension header, 'Path' which
provides such a mechanism.

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

      Which then allows the user to decide whether or not to continue
according to policy, or just not make the call. Otherwise, the network seems
to be in the business of deciding that the user really does not mind if the
call is anonymous. That seems fairly benign in this particular case, but not
generically (what if the policy was _no_ anonymous calls.)
  A 'no anonymous calls' policy would be in breach of the users right to
make anonymous calls. It is not the network that is deciding that the user
does not mind if the call is anonymous, it is the subscriber, and they have
a legal right to do this. The subscribe must be able to control what
information the network reveals about them. The user does not have the right
to ask the network to reveal information that the subscriber does not want
revealed - although the use can of course reveal the information themselves.

  I was referring to a no anonymous calls policy on the part of the
subscriber.
      2) Even with a well-crafted UA, why is the _user_ expected to
re-configure their client because of the _subscriber's_ wishes. And when the
policy changes, how will we indicate to all the users that they should now
re-configure their clients again ?

      They don't have to. Doing so just cuts down on the
reject-due-to-policy-violation-oops-retry cycles. Now, I assume the user
must have some relationship with the subscriber (else how does he have
credentials), and the subscriber _could_ just tell the user. Not everything
has to be automatic.
  Frequent reject-due-to- policy-violation-oops-retry cycles are just
unaceptable for wireless environments. There must be a 'works first time'
solution. If you think the user needs to be informed that their call has
become anonymous, then fine, let's standardise this indication.

  A wireless network is one in which the network tends to excercise a lot
more control over the UA than might be typical for other environments. It
this case, the network is likely to be able to push configuration to the
phone itself (i.e. the config for "what default privacy option to use".
(This of course makes the b2bua changing From headers more feasible as well,
as wireless providers tend to have fewer qualms about asserting this level
of control.)
      I hope all the Service Providers wanting to launch SIP services have
got their list of client requirements worked out. If your subscriber asks
for this anonymity service they will not be impressed if they have to
upgrade/re-configure all their clients. If you didn't inform them in advance
that the clients needed these capabilities, then they could refuse to
upgrade and still demand the anonymity service.

      Well, once the idea of an anonymity service is fully formed
(presumably what we are doing here) it makes sense that it is a feature that
a client can support or not support. (Maybe even a supported or requires
tag?) Then it is reasonable for a service provider to say you can make
anonymous calls if your client supports anonymity. If a subscriber has a
policy of _only_ anonymous calls, and a user has a client that cannot make
anonymous calls, then he is SOL.  I don't see why this is any different than
any _other_ situation where an optional client feature might be required by
SP or subscriber policy. Again, the alternative is a presumption on the
networks part that it knows what the user _really_ means to do better than
the user does. Such an presumption on policy violations scares me in the
generic sense.
  It's different because the 'subscriber policy' feature is not just a
groovy addition to the service, but something that the Service Provide must
provide for the subscriber 'by a simple means' (in the words of the European
legislation) by which they mean I make a phone call to my Service Provider
and ask. Upgrading possibly hundreds of clients might not be considered a
'simple means'.

  Again, not a question of knowing what the user 'wants' - in this case the
subscribers wishe's overrule the users wishe's - we know the user wants to
reveal their identity but in this case the user is 'SOL'.

  ...Mark

i don't see how "who pays for the service for a set of users" has any
relevance to the privacy discussion.

i do insist individual usernames and passwords.  if you do not have
that, then there is no way to figure out who made the calls, which is a
VERY big problem both for the company and for system in general.

I've noticed a lot of people posting messages in Microsoft Rich Text or
MHTML formats.

This is painful and hard to reply to, and makes it hard to follow the
thread of conversation. And it makes the messages nearly IMPOSSIBLE to
read on smaller-format devices.

Please:

1) Set your email program up to use plain text if at all possible. There
were guidelines for this on IETF Announce last year.

2) Don't just copy in the whole body of a message when you're responding
to a small section of it. Just include the relevant text and an
attribution to the original author -- like "Dean wrote:".

Thanks.

We could probably dig up the USENET etiquette FAQ if anyone would find
that useful.

Then you should take this up with the European Commission, and other
legislative organisations in the rest of the world.

The identity of the user is considered by them to (potentially) reveal
Personal Data of the subscriber. Personal Data is protected by 'Data
Protection' laws which you are free to disobey if you don't mind the fines.

[It's not 'who pays', is it who has legally contracted for provision of the
service (usually the same person who pays).]

The requirement is not about usernames, passwords, UAs, SIP, packets, IP,
clients, proxies, networks etc. etc. This requirement is about services,
service providers, Personal Data, subscribers, users and the protection of
their data according to the law.

Hi Gonzalo,

	This is Salva Rey, from Siemens CT in Munich. How are you 
doing?

	I wanted to comment you a couple of things about manyfolks.


	For what I see in manyfolks it seems that two aspects are 
being defined jointly:

	1. QoS capability exchange signalling and interaction with the 
offer/answer model(through methods and headers)	

	2. QoS requirements (in SDP fields)

	Point #1 will be always managed by the UA, but maybe #2 is 
let to the application...

	this has never been mentioned, but are we aware of this?
	will manyfolks provide any support for QoS capability exchange 
signalling in case that the format for media stream descriptor is 
other than sdp, let's say here sdpng or xml?

	my concern is that maybe these two aspects are woven too 
tightly, and later on manyfolks cannot be used if a format different 
to sdp is used.

regards,
Salva

A 'no anonymous calls' policy would be in breach of the users right to make
anonymous calls. It is not the network that is deciding that the user does
not mind if the call is anonymous, it is the subscriber, and they have a
legal right to do this. The subscribe must be able to control what
information the network reveals about them. The user does not have the right
to ask the network to reveal information that the subscriber does not want
revealed - although the use can of course reveal the information themselves.

 
I was referring to a no anonymous calls policy on the part of the
subscriber.  

I know you were. I no anonymous calls policy on the part of the _subscriber_
would breach the _users_ right to make anonymous calls. 

Frequent reject-due-to- policy-violation-oops-retry cycles are just
unaceptable for wireless environments. There must be a 'works first time'
solution. If you think the user needs to be informed that their call has
become anonymous, then fine, let's standardise this indication. 
 
A wireless network is one in which the network tends to excercise a lot more
control over the UA than might be typical for other environments. It this
case, the network is likely to be able to push configuration to the phone
itself (i.e. the config for "what default privacy option to use". (This of
course makes the b2bua changing From headers more feasible as well, as
wireless providers tend to have fewer qualms about asserting this level of
control.)  
 

Indeed. If I have to specify special client behaviour not defined in
RFC2543, then I might as well assume bis compliance, and then I can modify
From/To without needing to keep state and modify them back on responses -
easy.
 
However, my personal view is that we should minimise the requirements on SIP
clients in order for them to work on the wireless network. The more
wireless-specific requirements or worse, requirements specific to a
particular wireless system, then the less SIP clients will be developed for
that environment, which is a bad thing.
 
The problem with the 'config push' option is that it makes it hard to
develop more complex policies on behalf of the subscriber (e.g. based on
destination), because the whole policy is dictated by the flexibility of the
configuration that you can push to the user, which is limited by what is
standardised.
 
OK, so we could use 'config push' for the regulatory requirement for an
'always anonymous' service, and do more complex things with B2BUAs. But I
would like a single solution and anyway you are arguing that From/To
modification is NEVER required.

fine and i don't have any problem with any of that.  the display string
does protect the privacy of the user according to his/her wish either on
call by call basis or for all calls.

You have to honour the wishes of the SUBSCRIBER as well. I've explained why,
but that does not seem to be not enough for you, so look up the law
(97/66/EC) on the EU website (http://www.europa.eu.int/)

For clarity, I am not saying that I know this law to be 100% applicable to
SIP services - I am not a law court, so I could not do this - I am arguing
that it is likely that this or very similar requirements will apply, so we
should know how to deal with them.

The proposed revision of this document contains considerations about the
unsatisfactory situation with respect to email and Data Protection and urges
the electronic communications industry to pay more attention to Data
Protection. There are fairly explicit 'threats' that if things remain (in
their view) unsatisfactory, then further legislative measures will be
considered.

Paying attention to this stuff at this stage of system development is one
way that we *avoid* the need for *more* regulations to be imposed.

Mark,

I must admit that I am not following at all what you are saying. As far
as I know, the privacy laws and regulations are meant to protect
personal information disclosed by the person *to his service provider*,
either via the act of subscribing, and/or by the act of invoking the
service.

I think that the vast majority of the information the user puts in SIP
messages (either header or body) are no more "information disclosed to
the service provider" than the contents of files he FTPs, or dirty
pictures in a jpeg MIME body. They are information disclosed TO THE
RECIPIENT, which the service provider just happens to see going by, or
acts on to provide services for the user. If it were required that the
service provider not disclose this information, they'd all be getting
sued for not encrypting all the traffic going by. The exception are
things specifically for the consumption of the service provider, such as
proxy-authenticate tokens and the like.

I think the information that is of relevance to this discussion is stuff
that was *NOT* inserted by the user, but was instead inserted by the
service provider based on things the user had previously disclosed to
the service provider. These are the things which in fact do need some
level of protection, which is why we have this complicated applicability
statement on the privacy draft and why (I at least) would argue that the
only reasonable design is one in which any identifying information
inserted by the service provider be encrypted or otherwise protected
from disclosure to other parties (including the callee) unless the
customer explicitly requests it not to be.

This last, is of course, just a matter of the default setting of the
privacy: header, which can be handled by default UA configuration and
need not be the subject of protocol standardization.

Dave.

Then you should take this up with the European Commission, and other
legislative organisations in the rest of the world.
The identity of the user is considered by them to (potentially) reveal
Personal Data of the subscriber. Personal Data is protected by 'Data
Protection' laws which you are free to disobey if you don't mind the
fines.
[It's not 'who pays', is it who has legally contracted for provision of
the service (usually the same person who pays).]

The requirement is not about usernames, passwords, UAs, SIP, packets,
IP, clients, proxies, networks etc. etc. This requirement is about
services, service providers, Personal Data, subscribers, users and the
protection of their data according to the law.

As of this morning, the only feedback I have on the message draft is some
nits from Rohan. Are we done?

If I don't get additional negative feedback by midnight tonight (CDT), I
will cut a new release fixing the nits, and recommend we send it to the IESG
for IETF last call.

I think you have to add to the first sentence above "and information inserted 
by the user that is required by the Service Provider as a prerequisite for 
service". If the service provider requires that the user enter a valid ID, 
then it must be protected the same as an ID that the Service Provider 
inserted.

Dave,

I agree entirely with what you have written below, with three
clarifications:

1) If the user is *required* by the Service Provider to insert certain
information, then, for this discussion, it is the same as the Service
Provider inserting it - i.e. it doesn't matter which piece of physical
equipment inserts it if the information *has to be there* for the service to
work. In Juha's service the From field is like this, because unless you put
in 'anonymous' you MUST put your correct identity.

2) We must consider the *subscriber's* privacy request as well as the
user's. The subscriber may be a *different person* from the user. Either we
have to automatically get the subscriber's privacy policy to the UA, or the
network has to modify the fields which were network inserted, or inserted by
the user 'on behalf of' the network as per (1)

3) Personally, I go further than (1) and argue that information *expected*
(but not strictly *required*) by the Service Provider has similar status.
The SHOULD in the SIP spec wrt the contents of From/To is enough to mean
that a credible subscriber anonymity service should consider these fields.

So, my argument is that EITHER modification of the From/To fields may be
required in the network OR standardisation is required to reliably get the
subscriber's policy to the UA & deal with other similar problems.

To date I've seen no credible proposals for the latter, so I'm arguing we
should assume the former.

**The effect for the IETF SIP group** is only that it becomes a
'non-assumption' that the From/To fields are immutable within the network.
Future capabilities should be designed with this non-assumption wherever
possible, so that they are not broken by devices which do this. This is all
I am arguing about.

There will, of course, be some services which *are* broken by such devices.

...Mark

I think the information that is of relevance to this discussion is stuff
that was *NOT* inserted by the user, but was instead inserted by the
service provider based on things the user had previously disclosed to
the service provider. These are the things which in fact do need some
level of protection, which is why we have this complicated applicability
statement on the privacy draft and why (I at least) would argue that the
only reasonable design is one in which any identifying information
inserted by the service provider be encrypted or otherwise protected
from disclosure to other parties (including the callee) unless the
customer explicitly requests it not to be.

I think Dave's generally right, with the one caveat noted by Mark below:

And Mark responded:
------------------
I think you have to add to the first sentence above "and information
inserted by the user that is required by the Service Provider as a
prerequisite for service". If the service provider requires that the
user enter a valid ID, then it must be protected the same as an ID that
the Service Provider inserted.
------------------

I agree mostly with Mark here -- which is why I'm continuing to push
back on an approach that "requires" the From: field to be specific
user-identifying information or suggests that it is more significant
than a "display name" which might optionally be used by some nodes for
some sort of lightweight filtering and displayed at the end point.

From bis:

-----
8.1.1.3 From The From header field indicates the logical identity of the
initiator of the request, possibly the user's address-of-record. Like
the To header field, it contains a URI and optionally a display name. It
is used by SIP elements to determine which processing rules to apply to
a request (for example, automatic call rejection). As such, it is very
important that the From URI not contain IP addresses or the FQDN of the
host on which the UA is running, since these are not logical names. 

The From header field allows for a display name. A UAC SHOULD use the
display name "Anonymous", along with a syntactically correct, but
otherwise meaningless URI (like sip:thisis@anonymous.invalid), if the
identity of the client is to remain hidden. 
-----

Note that the strongest requirements statement about usage here is a
"SHOULD" class statement on anonymity, and guidelines include "possibly
the user's address-of-record" on content in general. The SIP spec does
NOT mandate that the From field: contain any specific information. This
is in some measure intended to prevent the regulatoryistic (I just made
that up) abuse of the field. 

Let us also consider the phrase "very important that the From URI not
contain IP addresses or the FQDN of the host on which the UA is running,
since these are not logical names." This clearly indicates that the From
field is intended to provide a LOGICAL reference, not a DIRECT
reference. "Logical" is a broad term, and implies that the field should
be completed in a manner logically consistent with the role in which the
completor expects to use that field or have that field used by target
nodes.

It doesn't mandate, sure, but the *implication* is important. The fact that
it might be used for services, processing rules, etc., gives (some) people a
strong feeling that it ought to be accurate.

Of course, on the Internet, no one can hear you scream 'you lied about your
identity!'

In a Service Provider environment people have different expectations, which
is why even SHOULD level requirements like that above lead to a feeling that
the Service Provider must check the value of the field.

No reasonable provider should put that requirement on From, for the
reasons Dean mentioned. This leaves the proxy-authentication data.
Interesting question is whether the proxy-authentication data needs to
be stripped after it has been "used", as it may well apply to several
down-stream proxies.

Hi,

I am a graduate student and am working on the control memory, 
design and proof of correctness for SIP as my course project. I 
had a few doubts and would be grateful if anyone could answer 
them.

1: How is a duplicate BYE or a CANCEL generated, is it at timeout 
or only whenever the application requests?

2: Are there any cases may be because of lost messages or delayed 
or incorrect messages which may result in the failure of the 
protocol ie exceptional cases which the protocol is not capable of 
handling.

3:CSEQ feild is incremented for each request within a dialog.Is it 
increased for the responses also? and will the retansmission of a 
request contain the same CSEQ value or an incremented one?

thanks and regards,
ruhiya

Mark,

I have a real problem with the way you have defined or envisioned a
privacy service.  Please see below...

A user who wants privacy of their self-revealed information has two very
reasonable choices, both of which are possible using baseline SIP (either
2543 or 3261).  Note that this is a very separate problem from
network-asserted identity used for PSTN interop, call trace, and call
return services.

1) The subscriber can configure their user agent not to reveal most types
of private information.

2) A provider can insert an anonymizing B2BUA (with or without media
anonymity) into the signaling path before forwarding outside its network.

I do not buy the argument that we need the network to provide this
service, but that it is somehow a burden for the network to implement this
service using a B2BUA.

thanks,

Subject: was Re: Screened FromL and Privacy
Subject: was Re: Summary of RE: [Sip] Comment, SIP Privacy draft
Subject: was lots of others, too

All this discussion of proxy modification of the From and To headers,
and the need for a B2BUA, seems to me to be a short-term problem only.

RFC3261 (2543bis-09) specifies matching of dialog-ids based only
on Call-ID and tags, not on display-name or on addr-spec.  So
when all endpoints are compliant with RFC3261, there will be no
problem with a proxy modifying the display-name or addr-spec in
the From header.

It is only during a transition period, when endpoints that conform
to RFC2543 are supported as well as newer ones.  How long will
this be?  How long will a proxy need to handle a UAC that doesn't
supply a Contact header?  How long will a proxy need to handle
a Record-Route header without the "lr" tag?  How long will a
UAS need to handle a BYE received prior to sending 2xx?  How long 
will the comparison be coded into the proxies and UAs looking 
for "z9hG4bK"?

In all cases, my hope is not too long.  And, at the point when
these "conversion aids" no longer need to be present in SIP
implementations, it will be safe for proxies to modify the From
header to provide anonymity, if the subscriber, or the user, or the
regulator, (or others?), says that it should.

In cases like 3GPP, where (IIRC) release 5 does not include
IMS connections outside of the wireless operator's network, the
problem is even simpler.  Since 3GPP required RFC3261 everywhere,
modification of the From header can be done immediately.  I would
hope this transition period and the need for "conversion aids" would
be over before 3GPP release 6 is deployed.

My conclusion from all of this is that 3GPP can require the UE to
insert a valid user identifier in the From header, and the S-CSCF can
change it if privacy is desired, on a session-by-session basis,
based on whatever rules the S-CSCF wants to follow.

Comments?

This is not what I have been arguing. I agree that this type of anonymity
service will require more than a plain proxy (which by some definitions
means it's a B2BUA).

I know this will break (some) services.

I want to minimise the (future) services that break, by avoiding the
assumption that such devices do not exist.

Hi Bill:

This is just to state that you made a very good summary of the situation
with 3GPP and I agree with your final conclusion.

If we don't go for such a solution we may risk the case when neither the
user nor the network (or regulator) required privacy. If we require the
endpoints to start sessions anonymously, just in case...  then the 
session will be anonymous even when not needed.

Therefore, I would like to see a consensus on Bill's proposal: Users
identify theirselves in the From (UAC), the proxy MAY anonymize the 
From if the policy (or the regulator) requires it.

/Miguel

Bill,

Indeed, this approach seems good to me too. But expect people to argue the
following points:
1) Proxies as defined in RFC3261 cannot modify the From field. Sure, it is a
small extension, but strictly speaking it is more than a pure proxy does.
2) This modification does break some services. It would be best to avoid it
except when necessary e.g. if the *user* requires privacy, then still put
Anonymous in the From field.
3) verification of the From field is either 'required for consistent service
in a Service Provider environment' (myself, probably most of 3GPP, Juha,
others ? ...) OR 'contrary to the definition of the From field as an
end-to-end user asserted field' (Dean, Dave, others ? ...) - we have no
consensus on this.

The only compromise I can see on this is:
a) Those who want to verify the From: field do
b) Those who don't want to don't
c) In the absence of trust relationships the From: field is completely
untrusted (like everything else!). If you have a trust relationship, then as
part of this you will agree whether From: can be trusted or not.
d) The contents of the From field MAY be modified by devices in the network.
So we should design new services and features with this assumption where
possible

(d) is a logical consequence of (a) - don't try and argue out (d) unless you
think you can exclude (a) too.

I believe the view amongst providers in 3GPP is that they would expect such
a requirement to be placed on the From field, if any information is to go in
there at all. They are _mostly_ reasonable in 3GPP :-)

If the proxy-authentication data could include the plain-text (user)name of
the user, and if the user or the subscriber has requested privacy, then the
information certainly could not be passed on.

I suppose you could pass it on to a 'trusted' entity, assuming that this
entity could reliably determine the intersection of the subscribers and
users privacy requirements so it knew what to do next.

Regards,

Mark

I would go even a few steps farther.

We have now identified TWO cases where un-proxy-like behavior will be
done in real networks.  The first, a few months ago, was where a
firewall control proxy modified the Contact header, and possibly 
also modified the addresses and ports in the SDP.  The second is here, 
where a privacy proxy modifies the From header (and quite probably, others).

So my recommendations:
1) It is worthwhile recognizing these situations in draft-ietf-sip-rfc3261bis,
   and including text that limits the message transformations that such
   network elements can perform.  Essentially this means defining the
   previously coined term "transparent B2BUA".

2) New serivces MUST be designed with the assumption that such "transparent
   B2BUAs" will be in the path, minimize the ways they will fail with such
   message transformations, and discuss the recovery action that a UA may
   take in such failure cases. In the same way that new services MUST be
   designed knowing that forking may happen.  (draft-ietf-sip-guidelines?)

An example where (2) has already been followed is draft-ietf-sip-replaces;
it uses to-tag and from-tag, rather than full contents of From and To.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: The SIP Negotiate Method
	Author(s)	: S. Parameswar, B. Stucker
	Filename	: draft-spbs-sip-negotiate-01.txt
	Pages		: 
	Date		: 16-Apr-02
	
There is a need to negotiate a multitude of parameters, settings, 
and algorithms when setting up sessions using Session Initiated 
Protocol (SIP). While SIP itself provides mechanisms for 
negotiation of these parameters on a per-session basis through the
use of the INVITE method, it does not provide a ready mechanism
for meta-session negotiation. The closest mechanism provided is 
the REGISTER method, however, this method is directed towards the 
registrar alone, and cannot be used to conduct negotiation of 
parameters between any two arbitrary SIP nodes.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader

"14.2 UAS Behaviour" 
mentions that a 500 (Server Internal Error) needs to include a
Retry-After header field ico. the 2nd invite is received before the
final response of the 1st INVITE is not sent yet.

"20.33 Retry-After" 
this header field can be used with 503, 404, 413, 480, 486, 600 or 603.

I assume that this list should include the 500 too?

[rfc2543bis-09]

Proxies in any form cannot modify bodies, and B2BUAs are likely to break
things if they try to. SIP security relies greatly on smime-protected
bodies.

What you fail to distinguish is that like identity, there are two sorts
of privacy:

1) UA asserted
2) Network asserted

UA asserted privacy requires that the network NOT tamper with what the
UA has done, nor insert additional information that compromises the
privacy of the UA.

Network asserted privacy  requires a full, non-transparent B2BUA. I see
this as an OPTIONAL service, EXTERNAL to the proxy-like CSCF elements.
In other words, an anonymizer application.

I disagree. I don't want the network mangling my user-to-user headers
unless I've specifically requested it to do so. Specifically, the
non-authenticated, non-mangled, non-protected From: field offers utility
which is DIFFERENT than that provided by network authenticated calling
party ID, and I don't want to sacrifice that utility just because this
is a capability the widely-deployed PSTN (as opposed to say Q.SIG)
didn't have . . .

There are two drafts that define how to save state in a UA for subsequent
use by a Proxy Server - State and Cookies.

State is part of the DCS work.  Cookies arose when IP assertions were 
made against State.  Cookies attempted to get around the IP issues
by defining it as exactly like HTTP cookies.  To our consternation,
the same IP claims were then made against Cookies!

We need to get this capability.  The question is, should we
base it on State or Cookies?

In my personal (biased) opinion we are better off with Cookies.
If anyone did want to fight the IP claim, you would clearly
be better off with 75% same language as HTTP cookies.

Brian

There are some good reasons to stick with an HTTP cookies approach, although I don't have a strong preference as long as we pick one. IANAL, but I'm sure the IPR issue won't go away by copying HTTP cookie language. On the other hand, appropriate substitution of normative references might deflect the claim. In any case, kludge-free SIP state mechanisms are long overdue.

I presume the reference for "Cookies" is still draft-willis-sip-cookies-00 of 
July 2001. I haven't seen any further discussion on this draft or responses 
to the comments I submitted Nov 19. From that draft, it appears there are 
significant security concerns with the use of "Cookies" in a fashion similar 
to HTTP as proposed in this draft.

State would appear to have fewer security concerns if it is simply a value 
stored in the UA for the beniefit of the proxy to fetch and use later. It is 
presumed that the lack of a standard definition of this state value would 
preclude its use by a different proxy than the one which stored it (at least 
by a proxy of a different design).

It continues to escape me why it would not be better for the proxy to simply 
stored this "state" in its own storage, rather than using every UA as a 
distributed storage device. This concept seems to go back to the days when 
memory was limited (the first telephone switch I was involved in designing 
had 64k bytes of memory!) When one can buy 512M bytes of memory for less than 
$100, this should no longer be an issue. The "state" draft seems to indicate 
that the only reason for doing this is so that "proxy servers can remain 
stateless for the duration of the call", but I have never heard a reason why 
this is desirable. (Note that bis-09 defines the term "call-stateful proxy".) 
Why don't we just admit that it is required in some cases to keep the call 
state in the proxy and stop trying to invent ways around this, all of which 
have security and performance problems?

I think this shows how far we are from any agreement on anything. In his 
e-mail of Apr 15, Dean "mostly" agreed with my statement (although crediting 
it to Mark).

While my statement was "If the service provider requires..." and I believe 
there have been a number of comments that certain service providers must 
require this to support mandated tracing, etc., your comment argues that "No 
reasonable provider should put that requirement on From..."

The issue again is what type of "service provider" is being talked about. It 
is clear that some may require this (a valid ID in From) and some may not. So 
my statement is true. If it's not the "From" field that must be provided, it 
is whatever field the discussion ends up with that provides the functionality 
that many presumed was the purpose of "From".

Sorry for the cross-post.

I've submitted some new Internet-Drafts on SIP privacy and identity. I hope
that these drafts can serve as a good starting point for discussion about
long-term cryptographic approaches to privacy and identity that will be
generally serviceable for the SIP protocol. As Dean's note to the SIP WG
list suggested, they are now available on softarmor.

Any comments on the drafts would be appreciated, and I hope we'll have a
chance to discuss them at the interim meeting.

The abstracts of the two drafts follow:

Privacy: This document defines new mechanisms for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) in support of privacy. Specifically, guidelines are provided
for the creation of messages that do not divulge personal identity
information. A new "privacy service" logical role for intermediaries is
defined to answer some privacy requirements that user agents cannot satisfy
themselves. Finally, means are presented by which a user can request
particular functions from a privacy service. 

Identity: The existing mechanisms for expressing identity in the Session
Initiation Protocol do not currently permit an administrative domain to
securely verify the identity of the originator of a request. This document
recommends practices and conventions for authenticating end users, and
proposes a way to distribute secure authenticated identities within SIP
messages.

My vote is for cookie as well - it is more generic and might be used for
other applications other than those in the DCS state draft.

  ----- Original Message -----=20
  From: Mpierce1@aol.com=20
  I presume the reference for "Cookies" is still =
draft-willis-sip-cookies-00 of July 2001. I haven't seen any further =
discussion on this draft or responses to the comments I submitted Nov =
19. From that draft, it appears there are significant security concerns =
with the use of "Cookies" in a fashion similar to HTTP as proposed in =
this draft.=20

  State would appear to have fewer security concerns if it is simply a =
value stored in the UA for the beniefit of the proxy to fetch and use =
later. It is presumed that the lack of a standard definition of this =
state value would preclude its use by a different proxy than the one =
which stored it (at least by a proxy of a different design).=20

  It continues to escape me why it would not be better for the proxy to =
simply stored this "state" in its own storage, rather than using every =
UA as a distributed storage device. This concept seems to go back to the =
days when memory was limited (the first telephone switch I was involved =
in designing had 64k bytes of memory!) When one can buy 512M bytes of =
memory for less than $100, this should no longer be an issue. The =
"state" draft seems to indicate that the only reason for doing this is =
so that "proxy servers can remain stateless for the duration of the =
call", but I have never heard a reason why this is desirable. (Note that =
bis-09 defines the term "call-stateful proxy".) Why don't we just admit =
that it is required in some cases to keep the call state in the proxy =
and stop trying to invent ways around this, all of which have security =
and performance problems?=20
That is the correct reference, although Brian actually edited the draft =
based on my rough notes . . .

I believe the security concerns are roughly equal -- in both cases, the =
UA is given a hunk of stuff that it has to regurgigate on future =
messages in this dialog.

Both approaches leave the format of the "hunk" open -- it could be =
cryptographically protected, just a hash value matching a table stored =
on the proxy, or almost anything else.

I also believe the security concern is SLIGHTLY less urgent than in =
HTTP. As I understand it, both state and cookie drafts indicate a =
substantially shorter lifetime for the token. In the case of state, the =
lifetime is the duration of the current dialog. In the case of cookie, =
it's the current dialog plus any dialog resulting from redirection or =
referral of the original dialog.=20

HTTP cookies, on the other hand, persist relatively indefiitely and may =
be extracted by any server in the domain of the cookie during any HTTP =
interaction with said server for the duraction of the cookie.

Now it is certainly true that one COULD put sensitive information in =
plain text into a state or cookie token such that other nodes might gain =
access to that information. The cookies draft does mention that this is =
not a good idea.

These kinds of questions regarding subject or message body fall into the
confidentiality category at that point...which is the next step in
providing privacy. The thread to this date has been focusing on identity
privacy as seen in the header fields, not the content of the SIP
message.  

I recommend, IMHO, that these items should be addressed separately, and
that the initial focus on SIP header privacy (except for the content and
related message body) is a good necessary first step to address. The
next obvious step should be the idea of confidentiality of the
content/message body as well as to the media itself (which I believe is
yet another separate issue from teh SIP protocol itself), which I
believe will be subject to required regulation when the smoke clears in
any event. Confidentiality will of course boil down to the SIPS
solution, IPSec possibly, or some other means, but is a separate topic
related to the caller/identification privacy.

When speaking in terms of privacy provided by a service provider, I
believe the act of requesting a UA account to be private to be a
customer subscription process separate and not provided as a SIP
signaling process. Unless my assumption is incorrect, in the event that
it is assumed that SIP will be used as the vehicle to provide the
subscription process and that this is the reason why the need for new
headers is being pursued within the WG. In that case I understand why
this is being pursued but that isnt something that I have seen clearly
in the thread.

I thought that Mark wanted clear direction for the draft to go, select
one of the three choices. The semantics could be hashed out during the
progress of the direction chosen.

When a user wishes to make an anonymous calls, SIP needs an indication for the network (i.e. Service Provider) to identify who is calling and translate or retrieve the identity of the calling from the service agreement, then pass the calling identity within the networks without sending the calling identity to the UA of the called party.

> 
> <Mark Chiou> Agree. So we have to separate the needs for Privacy and the needs for Network, such that the privacy is fully controlled by the UA. On the other hand, the Service Providers have the responsibility to obtain the UA's identify for network usage (i.e. Emergency, Law Enforcement, Call trace, and etc) without breaking the UA's privacy. I means the UA's identity, which is needed by the Network, shall not be delivered to the terminating of the UA.

Privacy, I think, in relation to a service provider is not the same as
anonimity to an Internet based user. Privacy is used to mask the
original user to the called party, and does not prevent law enforcement
from getting the originator of such calls if a law is broken. B2BUA's
implemented by an SP need not contain any user account information to
provide the level of privacy afforded by the B2BUA (topology hiding) as
opposed to the function of privacy which may be implemented by an SP
which may alias the users true identity to <PRIVATE> before sending the
packet on to the B2BUA which can then scrub the IP address. You can
still track the communication to the SP, but then you must use the
proper vehicle to request the proprietary information located in the SP
databases to identify the caller.

How do SP's of PSTN networks cope with lawsuits today when law
enforcement must get this information? I am seriously asking this
question not being sarcastic, anyone know the answer? It seems to me
that the questions have been answered by the the SPs' of the dinosaurs
that we are replacing, we must take some of the lessons learned as a
model for answering these questions dont you think?

I can see this for publicly non-service provider hosted UA's as a
possibility, but for those enterprises, SOHO's serviced by SP's
regulations will be developed that require SP's of these types of
communications to have more stringent rules and processes. The
telecommunications industry today must comply with such regualtions for
call traces, wiretaps etc. Every country has some set of regulations
that place these requirements on SP's of our particular flavor of
communications, which though different from the PSTN world will no doubt
adopt many of those same restrictions and regulations for many similar
aspects. I am not versed in the regulations or telecommunications but I
do know that they exist. Many parties in this list have brought many
such examples to the list, which were of great interest to me. 

I think that implementing it on the UA will be a great idea, and
probably will be implemented by many vendors just as NAT and firewall
traversal solutions are today, but in the SP realm many of these
features will not be required to be active and in many cases will be
restricted by policies other than the SP due to the fact that the SP
will most likely provide a centralized functin for this service in order
to meet regulation as well as to meet security policies implemented by
customers of the SP which would look upon such mechanisms as a bypass of
such policies, not to mention not very scalable in larger environments.

Just my 2 cents

to me this is the same thing as verifying the customer's source ip
address.  we as a service provider DO check that the source ip address
of packets that we receive from our subscribers really belong to them.
if all service providers would do such checking, dod attacks would be
must more easier to trace down.

Bill's argument breaks down in a few important points.

1)	Such a proxy" would not be RFC 3261 compliant.

2)	Release 5 does not preclude interworking with other SIP networks. It
merely does not specify how it occurs. It does not specify how interworking
with R2 might be performed, but I am sure that some wireless network at some
point in the future will specify it. The fact that Release 6 might get round
to a full specification will not invalidate any proprietary interworking
methods. Given the importance that some operators are placing on
interworking with enterprise networks, and the fact that most of the
enterprise SIP terminals out there are closer to RFC 2543 on this one than
to RFC 3261, I do not see it happening. Enterprise terminals also tend to
sit around longer than anyone thinks, and even if they are not attached to
the network, people still expect to pull them out of the cupboard after a
couple of years, plug them into the network, and see them work.

3)	In the longer term, with split mobiles, we cannot guarantee that the
UA part of the split is RFC 3261 conformant. Similar comments apply to the
lifetime of RFC2543 terminals as above.

"Short term" in Bill's argument can be 5 years or more.

Keith

Hi!

I have a question related to the message draft:

What should be used, if only a URL to the content (e.g. http),
but not the content itself is delivered to the receiving UA, so
that it is the receiving users decision, whether to download the
content of not.

This makes sense, if the _bandwidth_is_limited_
and _large_messages_ are sent. This could be even a service
(in some network element, e.g. store and forward server)
provided to the user, to avoid that the channel down to the
user agent gets congested for too long time.

Is e.g. the Call-Info header field a good idea?
Or should the payload be used for this?
Better proposals?

cheers,
 Bernie

the above is consistent with what i have tried to say about this topic
and contains nothing new.  this whole thread has thus been more or less
useless.

I think we're about at the end of this one.

Two final points from me:
1) Dean's desire to avoid having the From: field mangled unless he has
specifically requested it is reasonable. I still think  that the
subscriber's wishes could overrule this though.

This is no different from the ISDN 'Special Arrangement' where the user
inserts any number they like in the Calling Party Number field. The network
passes it though with no checking, changing, nothing - I think this is
analogous to what Dean wants for the From field.

But the network still removes this information if the subscriber wants
anonymity. The stated purpose of the field is user identity, which implies
Personal Data of the subscriber. This is enough to argue that the network
must remove it if privacy is required, and this is certainly the application
of current legislation to ISDN.

What is the stated purpose of the From field - I do not think it is
sufficiently different for us to be _sure_ that we can avoid the
requirement.

So, the munging may still be required, but I certainly agree it should be
avoided wherever possible.

2) In formal terms, 'B2BUA == NOT Proxy'. We all know there will be/are
devices which behave very much like a proxy, but perform some additional
functions, such as these privacy services. This is fine. Everyone should be
aware that with only two terms defined 'B2BUA' and 'Proxy', such devices
fall into the B2BUA category.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: HTTP Digest Authentication Using AKA
	Author(s)	: R. Housley, W. Polk
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-00.txt
	Pages		: 17
	Date		: 17-Apr-02
	
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework
includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes
employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism performs user
authentication and session key distribution in Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-
response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.  This memo
specifies an AKA based one-time password generation mechanism for
HTTP Digest access authentication.

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi Bernie,

You describe the concept of content indirection. The MESSAGE draft
intentionally does not specify that behavior, as it is really a more general
problem. It is particularly applicable to NOTIFY, and is probably to _any_
method that can carry a body.

Sean Olson recently published a draft collecting requirements for content
indirection. I expect work to continue in that are in the near future.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: HTTP Digest Authentication Using AKA
	Author(s)	: A. Niemi, J. Arkko, V. Torvinen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-00.txt
	Pages		: 17
	Date		: 17-Apr-02
	
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework
includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes
employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism performs user
authentication and session key distribution in Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-
response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.  This memo
specifies an AKA based one-time password generation mechanism for
HTTP Digest access authentication.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader

I couldn't disagree more.

Our WG chairs have been enormously patient with the latest batch of rants and tirades on this subject. The quality of discussion has improved measurably since the one-hour RPID rathole in Minneapolis. Since the union of all proposed requirements is the null set, the most effective path forward will of necessity involve difficult compromise against less important requirements in order to satisfy those that will really matter over time. Frankly, Jon Peterson has done an excellent job of taking up this challenge and laying out some concrete proposals to address it.

While you are certainly entitled to your opinion, it should be abundantly clear by now that this set of issues is important to many in the sip community and isn't going away just because you would like to dismiss it. Based on list traffic, rough consensus *isn't* saying this is useless and it *isn't* saying we can ignore these issues and move on.

I don't think the question should be one vs. the other.  More a matter
of merging the contents.

If state is chosen, then the syntax should be changed to be
consistent with http cookies, as is recommended in the cookies draft.
Also, requirements about sending state tokens for associated calls
need to be thought through more carefully.

If cookies is chosen, then the "Requires" mechanisms needs to be added, 
so that a proxy will know whether its cookies will be returned.  Also, 
the rules for UA inserting cookies into requests and responses need to be 
more carefully defined - the state draft deals with privacy (that ugly word 
again) concerns about sending cookies when the proxy that needs them
is not on the path of the request or response.

So I think the real question is which of two paths should be taken, since
the destination is the same for both.

Subject: [Sip] Cookies or State

There are two drafts that define how to save state in a UA for subsequent
use by a Proxy Server - State and Cookies.

State is part of the DCS work.  Cookies arose when IP assertions were 
made against State.  Cookies attempted to get around the IP issues
by defining it as exactly like HTTP cookies.  To our consternation,
the same IP claims were then made against Cookies!

We need to get this capability.  The question is, should we
base it on State or Cookies?

In my personal (biased) opinion we are better off with Cookies.
If anyone did want to fight the IP claim, you would clearly
be better off with 75% same language as HTTP cookies.

What you said in the rest of the e-mail about the failure of anonymizing 
B2BUAs sounded pretty "conclusive" to me. (rather than "not conclusive" as 
you said above). Can we agree that anonymizing B2BUA is not an acceptable 
answer to any privacy requirements?

I wanted to speak to some of these points.

I agree that privacy starts with the user agent - populating headers with
appropriately private values and so forth. I also agree that getting
dynamic, 'anonymous' IP addresses is a way to achieve the privacy that one
might otherwise request from an intermediary. I don't agree, however, that
this means we should abandon any line of reasoning that uses intermediaries.
Although the heyday of penet.fi is long-gone, there are still third-party
anonymizer services for SMTP and HTTP in operation today. There are sorts of
anonymity that are valuable and which rely on intermediaries. Sometimes, it
might not be obvious to users how 'private' their IP addresses are
(something you wouldn't want to be wrong about, eh?). Sometimes, users may
not have control over how the headers of their messages are populated.

Even getting privacy from the same service provider from whom you get SIP
registration services makes sense in some cases. If I buy my service from a
very large service provider (MSN, say), then simply revealing my service
provider is unlikely to reveal my identity - if MSN provided anonymization,
I'd feel relatively anonymous using their service. For many sorts of
interactions this may be an adequate amount of privacy - sort of like seeing
the postmark, with its zip code, on a letter without a return address.
Agreed that if the xenuphiles sued MSN for my anonymous wrongdoings, MSN
would undoubtedly pony up my name. But if you are doing things with
third-party-provided anonymity that will bring legal sanctions against you,
then you had better be sure you have a crusading anonymity provider that is
willing to become a political prisoner in your stead - even that is,
however, not entirely unheard of.

So in short, I see no harm in recognizing both anonymous IPs and
intermediaries as means to achieve privacy. As it happens, both are
mentioned in my new privacy draft.

Hi,

I'd like to propose a concrete plan to move forward with a solution for
network-asserted identity and privacy.  I'm proposing this as an
individual (who is sick of reading about this topic on the mailing
list).  Below I've listed some of problems that various folks were
apparently trying to solve in this space.

1.  Provide a Network-Asserted ID
 a.   Within a trusted administrative domain or federation of domains
 b.   For interworking with PSTN mechanisms*
 c.   Usable across administrative boundaries

2.  Provide capability for Call Trace
 a.   Within a trusted administrative domain or federation of domains
 b.   For interworking with PSTN mechanisms*
 c.   Usable across administrative boundaries

3.  Provide privacy
 a.   by the user directly withholding information from the network
 b.   in the network for user-provided info at the user's request
 c.   in the network for user-provided info based on network policy
 d.   of network-provided information

4.  Allow for a user-provided "hint" for Network-Asserted ID

*(with gateways in the trusted domain or federation)

Most of the snags and disagreements we have had with the existing
Remote-Party-ID draft (draft-ietf-sip-privacy-04) are related to problems
1c, 2c, and 4.  Even a very scaled-down version of this draft would allow
for trusted intermediaries and user agents (including gateways) to
exchange network asserted identity and provide the capability for call
trace within a domain or federation of trusted domains.  The solution is
as simple as a single header which carries the identity in clear text,
which is added by the first proxy that authenticates the user, and
removed before it leaves the trust boundary.  This would solve
1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b.

Jon Peterson just drafted a Network-Asserted Identity proposal which
requires S/MIME signatures on each message.  This address the whole
category of problems related to 1 and 2 using cryptographic mechanisms.
While you could use this mechanism inside trusted networks, the
mechanism may be too heavyweight to prove practical for use with every
call in every network.  However, this is the only proposed mechanism
to solve 1c, and 2c in an elegant manner.

Jon also took a stab at the "longer-term" privacy requirements.  His draft
discusses how to solve problems 3a and 3b, and could be extended to
support 3d (as proposed in Jon's identity draft).  In addition, a network
has always been able to introduce an anonymizing B2BUA to solve problem
3c.

Finally, we have problem 4.  Some folks have proposed that
UAs should provide a hint using the same mechanism used to
communicate network asserted identity among trusted entities.
Others propose that authentication servers that create a
network asserted identity accept multiple "usernames" during
authentication and use this as the hint.  AFAIK these are the
only two choices, and we can come up with an answer to this
question in a separate thread.  The answer does not fundamentally
change any of the mechanisms we select to solve the other problems.

So, in summary, I'm proposing:

No additional work is required to implement 3c

Three short term deliverables
I) adopt draft-peterson-sip-privacy-longterm as a WG item to solve
   3a and 3b

II) write an extension to I) as a WG item for requesting privacy of
network asserted ID (however it is expressed) to support 3d.  This would
get used by III and IV.

III) pare down the mechanism in draft-ietf-sip-privacy to only address 1a,
1b, 2a, and 2b.  quickly get closure on which mechanism we use for 4, and
include it in the draft.  keep the current applicability statement.

One or more longer term deliverables, including
IV) draft-peterson-sip-identity ... to address a more general way to
solve 1 and 2 including 1c and 2c.  Note that this draft is the first
step toward providing real cryptographic identity services.  I think we
also need to address this topic as a charter item.

We might also provide an informational document describing how to map
privacy and identity between SIP and the PSTN.

hope this helps.
thanks,
-rohan

hi
  We had a doubt about the significance of "maddr" parameter in the Contact
header.
  When the proxy gets the next hop information from the Location Service,
should it honour the "maddr" (when present) as the next hop address ? Or
should it take the   "host" part of the Contact header ?


Thanks

rekha.

Hello,
If a response to  OPTIONS request is an 4xx message (420 or 486 etc...),
then does the UAS wait for an ACK from Proxy ? Or not, ACK is only a
part of the INVITE transaction?

Thanks in advance,
Hatice S. Orbay

For 3xx+ responses ACK is part of the INVITE transaction, only for 2xx
response its not a part of INVITE transaction.

Also, for responses to requests other than INVITE, ACK is not sent.

Hi,

ACK is used with INVITEs ONLY. It may, or may not, depending on the status
code in the response, be part of the INVITE transaction itself, or a
separate transaction.

See the spec for more details...

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol Extension for Instant 
                          Messaging
	Author(s)	: B. Campbell, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-message-03.txt
	Pages		: 19
	Date		: 18-Apr-02
	
Instant Messageing (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between
users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not
required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode,
that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for
participants to maintain an interactive conversation.
The MESSAGE method is an extension to the Session Initation Protocol
(SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  MESSAGE requests
carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests
do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each
Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE
requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some
other SIP request.
Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP it inherits all the
request routing and security features of that protocol.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

	Title		: Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in 
                          the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Peterson
	Filename	: draft-peterson-sip-identity-00.txt
	Pages		: 25
	Date		: 18-Apr-02
	
The existing mechanisms for expressing identity in the Session
Initiation Protocol oftentimes do not permit an administrative domain
to verify securely the identity of the originator of a request.  This
document recommends practices and conventions for authenticating end
users, and proposes a way to distribute secure authenticated
identities within SIP messages.

	Title		: A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation 
                          Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Peterson
	Filename	: draft-peterson-sip-privacy-longterm-00.txt
	Pages		: 26
	Date		: 18-Apr-02
	
This document defines new mechanisms for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) in support of privacy.  Specifically, guidelines are
provided for the creation of messages that do not divulge personal
identity information.  A new 'privacy service' logical role for
intermediaries is defined to answer some privacy requirements that
user agents cannot satisfy themselves.  Finally, means are presented
by which a user can request particular functions from a privacy
service.

Hello,

    I am new to SIP and have been trying to learn more about it since
I would like to work on a project in this area.

I have some very basic queries in this. Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

I would like to know what exactly are the applications/ uses of this SIP
protocol. I know that it can be used for Internet Telephony applications
but i am not clear as to if i build some product/software on this who are 
the likely customers/ what is the market.

Also when there are so many open source codes and applications available for 
free on the internet why should anyone build similar
sort of applications ?

Please let me know where i can get more information on such issues.

Thanks,
R.P.

You need to be more clear. 1 and 2 talk about administrative domains and
administrative boundaries and now you are talking about trust boundaries. How
do you define an administrative domain, an administrative boundary, and a
trust boundary ?

No. The UA is (normally) untrusted but still needs it. If you were only
talking about the case when privacy was requested, then it doesn't address the
requirement to provide call trace for anonymous calls. The user is obviously
untrusted and hence cannot be given the caller-id in clear-text. The privacy
draft solves this by handing out an encrypted Remote-Party-Id which can
subsequently be used for call trace (as well as other features for that
matter, e.g. anonymous call return).

Well it certainly impacts it. If you go with the first solution then you also
accept that Remote-Party-Id can be provided by an untrusted entity, so I don't
think we can solve these independently.

It's unclear that 3b is independent of which mechanism you choose to provide
the hint above.

As mentioned above, I'm not clear on exactly what 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b are, but
if the "network asserted identity" draft would neither address privacy for
network asserted identity, nor call trace for anonymous calls, then I
certainly disagree with this.

Hi Roopa,

As u said SIP is mainly used in VoIP. It can be used in conjunction with other protocols like MGCP, RADIUS, COPS etc to build applications in Iternet telephony. 

U can know more about latest happenings in SIP at http://www.sipcentre.com

HTH

Ranjit

Folks:

Enclosed is an I-D for review that describes SIP support for IN
services.  The I-D represents agreement of the IETF SIN (SIP/IN) design
team and is intended for publication as an informational RFC.  It has
been through Last Call in the IETF SIN DT and the comments of the WGs
identified in the To list of this email are now being solicited.

I diagree. Solve the other problems first. Then we have three choices:
1) Use the same header for the 'hints'
2) Define another header for the 'hints'
3) Assume the 'hint' in in the authentication 'username'

If you choose (1), then you may need something extra in that header to
distinguish between the two use-cases.

Hi Juan Carlos,

There is not, as far as I know. However, it would be better to get the
necessary implementation experience with manyfolks and SDP, and once we
obtain this experience, elaborate a mechanism for SDPng.

Regards,

Gonzalo

(3) doesn't work.  my username is jh@song.fi, but my from uri that i
want to use, can be, for example, tel+358441234567.

today i'm using the from uri as the hint, which works fine if the user
is not requesting anonymity.  if the user is requesting anonymity and
the call goes to another sip user, then either a b2bua or a new "hint"
header, such as really-from, is needed.

In fact, e-mail today uses two different fields: the "SMTP From:"
parameter defines who is posting the message, and the "From:" field
defines the user who is supposed to get the replies. (OK, there is also
a "sender" field, when someone sends a message "on behalf" of other
user(s), but we won't get there.) By this logic, we would need a "SIP
From", identifying the account sending the message, in addition to the
current "From" field, wich identifies the user.

Why is such information useful if it's unauthenticated?

Are you planning to use it to implement policy? If so,
inclusion of such a header only sets a trap for naive
implementors.

If not, are you envisioning this information will be presented
to users? If that's your goal, you'll want to do something
that works with deployed phones. As a convention (and I'm not
proposing that this be standardized), you could obtain the
desired effect with something like:

INVITE sip:bob@example.com SIP/2.0
From: "Adam Roach forwarded by Robert Sparks"
<sip:adam@dynamicsoft.com>;tag=12397
...

Right?

I feel quite strongly that we should *not* include this sort of information
in the current REFER draft, and work on providing an *authenticated*
version of this draft at a later date.

 The information could be useful because C could authenticate the identity
outside of the SIP protocol if that is felt necesary. In many cases such
authentication is not required. There can be other means extra-protocol  of
dealing with abusive callers.

Once a proxy has determined the value of this "Network-Asserted ID",
there are actually four possibilities to consider.
   a.   Sending it to another proxy within a trusted admin domain 
		or federation of domains
   b.   Sending it to a PSTN gateway within a trusted admin domain
		or federation of domains
   c.   Sending it to a proxy outside the trust admin domain
		or federation of domains
   d.   Sending it to a UA

Unfortunalely caller-id and call-trace are useless without choice (d).
So my first comment is that 1d and 2d are needed in your itemized list 
of problems to solve.

I think it is a major simplification to reduce these four cases to only
two:
   a.  Sending it to a network element within a trusted admin domain
		or federation of domains
   b.  Sending it to a network element outside the trusted admin domain
		or federation of domains
(and who says PSTN gateways are always trusted? Should the GW generate
a private used-once phone number for the call attempt?)


And, as much as I'd like to believe your comment that no additional work
is required to implement 3c, are we really willing to leave it that all
services will break if anonymity is requested?  Or should services
be designed with this in mind?

The philosophy is nice, but not all that useful if it can't be put
into practice.  As was said previously on this subject:

Last February Jonathan Rosenberg said:

I still believe we should recognize that such things will exist, and that
services will need to cope with them, and that guidance to designers of
new services would benefit from knowing, in advance, what such elements
might do to cause them trouble.

Hi Dean,

I have the following questions:

	1. What is the purpose of this identity draft?
	   If it is for network usage, then identity info shall not be delivered to the UAS 
	   when the Privacy is set to Anonymous.
	2. Why is using MIME type instead of new optional header field?

The purpose of this identity draft is to define a general-purpose way for an
'authentication service' to provide a secure, verified identity for the
originator of a request that can be inspected by any potential recipients.
Privacy concerns are addressed in the draft - the identity will not be
decipherable by a UAS when privacy is requested.

> 	2. Why is using MIME type instead of new optional header field?

This is a good question, and unfortunately a deep one. That short story is
that it is easier to stage the required security properties (integrity via
signature with certificate, replay protection, optional confidentiality) in
a body than in a header. With a body, we can also do this through baseline
bis09 security mechanisms without having to invent anything new.

> 	   Why Call-ID and Date are required?

To provide reference integrity to the request, and a small amount of replay
protection, respectively.

> non-Anonymous calls?

If privacy is not required, then presumably the identity can and should be
shared with any potential recipient. Seeing a network-verified identity
might make a recipient more comfortable that they know the identity of the
originator of a request. Users should only request privacy when they need it
- I often don't accept phone calls that are from a blocked ID, myself.

I have some hopes that the 'auth-id' system described in this draft (or
whatever it eventually ends up being when the draft is done) will be
applicable to things like forwarding and referral. I think it may already
help out with some identity problems in forwarding.

Those MIME types do get confusing  when they're embedded, eh? The
Content-Length in that example does not pretend to be accurate - maybe I'll
update it to a less inaccurate value. However, the unique-boundaries, are, I
hope, correctly aligned.

All interesting concepts, and as you'll note I left open the possibility
that other information could be put into the 'auth-id' token as necessary.
For the time being, the draft is only concerned, really, with (1) and (3)
above. I'm surprised you make a distinction between (2) and (5) - I though
the fact that (2) encompasses (5) is what differentiates (2) from (1). Then
again, I don't really understand (2) that well either. Anyway, I don't think
the identity draft needs to get into any of these details - this mechanism
could be extended at a later time to accomodate these concepts as necessary.
SIP needs to grapple a bit with what these other sorts of identities are
before we figure out how to stuff them into secured bodies.

> 	6. Every identity shall have its own privacy attribute,

This identity draft does depend on and extend the accompanying privacy
draft. Frankly, I think ascribing a new privacy attribute to every
conceivable form of identity is unnecessary, and possibly dangerous. A user
shouldn't have to know, when they create a message, all of the various
headers in a message for which they need privacy - merely what kind of
privacy they need. While there is definitely a relationship between identity
and privacy, I think they are separable and they benefit from separate
consideration.

I've submitted draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-01.txt to the Internet Drafts
queue. This version includs refinements made by Bernie Hoeneisen to my
earlier draft.

The draft should be announced shortly on ietf-announce.

In the meantime, please review:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-01.txt

or

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-01.htm
l

or

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-01.xml


This is a "P-header" draft addressing 3GPP's required header for
reporting a service proxy assignment in the REGISTER response.


Please review ASAP. We need to get this to IETF last call by the end of
the month if at all possible.

Fair enough.  Let's say for now that a trusted entity is 
trusted not to maliciously modify messages, or 
reveal "private" network asserted ID information outside 
the "trusted" federation.  So, ordinary UAs in "my" service 
provider network are not trusted.

OK, I hope we agree that 1a, 1b, and 2b would by solved by 
the scaled down mechanism.  You could still provide call 
trace (2a) within this network by using accounting 
mechanisms.  You will probably say that insuring you have an 
accounting record for each call is a burden.  Also, you do 
lose the ability to do call return with this mechanism, but I 
do not consider this a short-term requirement.  (You might 
disagree).

I think it does provide a solution here for a small scope.

I'm suggesting that in order to solve this problem, one 
choice (3) is that we can make these proxies smart enough 
that they can accept jh@song.fi or +358441234567 in the 
username field, and understand that these two things refer to 
the same user.

OK, I agree that this list is clearer than the one I proposed.

Lets assume that the Network Asserted ID is stripped as it 
leaves a trust boundary only if privacy is requested (so you 
get 1d).  Then the only problem to solve is anonymous call 
trace (2d).  I think that some providers can choose to offer 
call trace by storing accounting records for some period of 
time.  Alternatively, the provider could require a signature-
based mechanism like the one that Jon proposed.

To clarify, I intended for gateways which are not trusted to 
be treated like any other device in a different domain.  An 
untrusted PSTN gateway would need to be addressed using a 
signature-based mechanism.  Consequently, it would not be 
able to provide an actual phone number and just set it to 
screened.

I don't think that using an anonymizer has to break features 
unless these feature explicitly need raw identity 
information.  Also, I'm not really sure what you are 
proposing instead.

I assume we understand 'across administrative boundaries' here to refer to
any 'untrusted' destination?

I really have a hard time seeing why 1b (and 2b by extension) needs to be a
separate case from 1a (and 2a). Surely PSTN gateways are 'trusted', and no
element is going to do anything differently when sending a request to a PSTN
gateway than they would do when sending it to any other 'trusted' element?

I also haven't seen any great need in my own identity draft to make use of
the distinction along the lines of 1a and 1c ('trusted' and 'untrusted') - I
feel that this distinction is motivated architectures that arise from the
absence of cryptographic mechanisms. But I understand that there are some
who want to carve the problem up this way. Personally, I view 1a, 1b and 1c
as requirements that are differentiated only by pseudoproblems.

> 2.  Provide capability for Call Trace

The distinction between 1 and 2 overall is a little fine to me as well.
Surely network-asserted identity is a way of implementing call trace, right?
Call trace implies revealing identity selectively, namely the privacy
requirements entailed in 3, but I'm not sure we need a separate category for
this. Is there something other than what we are already doing to implement 1
and 3 that we'd need to implement 2?

3 & 4 below are both fine.

Agreed. Nothing pressing, anyway.

Fine by me, obviously.

So, today my identity draft already contains a privacy extension for the
style of NAI provided in that draft. It declares a Privacy header priv-value
for 'auth' for this purpose. That could be generalized, certainly, though
exactly what it would entail would undoubtedly be different for different
NAI systems. In my identity draft, it entails that one SHOULD not distribute
an NAI, and if one does, it MUST be encrypted. Personally, I don't think
that relying on downstream entities to remove the NAI when they see fit is
sufficient, and this would probably be a point of contention in any attempt
to agree on a single meaning for this 'auth' priv-value.

I'd therefore like to suggest that we think a little more about this. Maybe
there's a way to generalize the syntax but not the semantics for any
particular NAI system. However, if I were the user requesting privacy, I'd
want to know whether encryption or removal were going to be used...

I don't think the mechanism you need to use for 4 should be included in this
draft - I think the manner in which you provide your identity to entities
that create NAIs has no obvious dependencies on the NAI distribution
mechanism. In so far as this may be a matter for SIP (the people that seem
to want this may have some out-of-band way of getting this data), it should
probably be in its own draft.

I'd also like to comment that I think getting the existing sip-privacy-04
mechanism into parity with a reasonable applicability, including as Flemming
sugggests robust definitions of trust, administrative boundaries, and so
forth is not necessarily a trivial task.

Suits me. Although the mechanism my draft proposes is admittedly
heavyweight, I think it addresses the general requirements with few new
protocol mechanisms. I'm looking forward to comments on it. I have no reason
today to think that it will require a 'long term' to complete this work.

Juha, among others, had argued this in the past, anyway. I think we do need
a way to map SIP's privacy apparati to the appropriate ISUP presentation
restriction bits, and so on. This is just part of the SIP-T work.

the point that i wanted to make is that my "username" is totally
separate from my "from uri" and that BOTH exist in the invite that i
send.  when my sip/pstn gw forwards the invite to pstn, the network must
verify that the "from uri" really belongs to me as identified by the
username.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: HTTP Digest Authentication Using AKA
	Author(s)	: R. Housley, W. Polk
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-00.txt
	Pages		: 17
	Date		: 17-Apr-02
	
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework
includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes
employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism performs user
authentication and session key distribution in Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-
response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.  This memo
specifies an AKA based one-time password generation mechanism for
HTTP Digest access authentication.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

That's sort of a quirk in your gateway -- it maps From: to
calling-party-ID. Most gateways work that way today. They won't
necessarily do so in the future.

It COULD map "Username" from an authorization header to
calling-party-ID. It also COULD generate the challenge to get an
appropriate authorization header back. That may not be the "right" way
to do it, but that's what we're talking about here -- finding the
"right" way to go forward.

no it could not because the user may have any number of calling party
numbers belong to different area codes and even different countries.
the user thus definitely needs to be able to control the calling party
id.

this is what we do today, but knowing who the user is doesn't mean that
the proxy knows which calling party id the user wants to use.

the proxy MUST respect the user's will regarding the calling party id
within the limits of calling party ids of that user.  the proxy has no
right to pick one on its own.

Hi:

A very simple comment regarding the DHCPv6 option for SIP servers I-D.

The draft has a duplicated reference to the "SIP: locating SIP servers" I-D, future RFC 3263. It is listed as both references 3 and 7.

Regards,

    Miguel

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation 
                          Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Peterson
	Filename	: draft-peterson-sip-privacy-longterm-00.txt
	Pages		: 26
	Date		: 18-Apr-02
	
This document defines new mechanisms for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) in support of privacy.  Specifically, guidelines are
provided for the creation of messages that do not divulge personal
identity information.  A new 'privacy service' logical role for
intermediaries is defined to answer some privacy requirements that
user agents cannot satisfy themselves.  Finally, means are presented
by which a user can request particular functions from a privacy
service.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-peterson-sip-privacy-longterm-00.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-peterson-sip-privacy-longterm-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-peterson-sip-privacy-longterm-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

Well, the user COULD have many different usernames to present to the
gateway, one for each public ID. They might not use the same username
for a calling-party-ID service (that is what we're talking about) as
they use for routing service on a proxy.

It's a different way to look at the problem, and I offer it only as an
existence proof for alternatives.

fine. a user may or may not have many calling party ids associated with
th same authentication username.  so the requirement is to support both
cases.

yes, there is at least the above two alternatives and the scheme
whatever it is must support both is them.

also, i would like to add one more requirement, which is important for
backwards compatibility with thousands of currently deployed UAs, which
assume that (if the calling party is not anonymous) the calling party's
call can be returned by using its from uri.

Consider the following scenario: (A) is inviting (B):

1. (A)--------------------INVITE --------------------->(B)
2. (A)<------------------180 RIGING------------------(B)
3. (A)--------------------CANCEL------------------->(B)
4. (A)<------------------OK----------------------------(B)
5. (A)<---------487 Request Terminated-----------(B)
6. (A)--------------------ACK------------------------->(B)

OK (4) reply corresponds to the CANCEL (3) request.
487 Request Terminated (5) reply corresponds to the INVITE (1) request.

Regards,

Bobby Sardana.

Adam,

I strongly support Tom position.

Referred-by is useful for Intranet/Extranet cases.

Why do you want to remove (insistenly ;-)something which is already in the draft 
and surely often used ? Could you explain the Problem ?

I would propose to let This Referred-by in the draft and to provide an 
authenticated version later.

Best Regard,

Patrick

I'm not sure I see the connection between the last two sentences? How would
one make use of an unauthenticated referred-by in dealing with abusive
callers? I would tend to expect that abusive callers would be very likely
spoof refered-by headers if it is allowed.

I can accept the idea of referred-by being useful _if_ the endpoint has
another channel of authentication. I am skeptical about any real use of it
without authentication.

Considering that Robert's original question was not, "is there a use for an
unauthenticated refered-by?" but was instead "Is there use for refer if it
is published without referred-by?" with the understanding that a solid
referred-by header would be the subject of future work. From that
perspective, I have to agree with Adam's belief that referred-by should be
removed from the current draft.

Y'know, sometimes I (personally, not as chair) think we take
the security argument just a little too far.

Sure, I can finagle the From, but Referred-By is the header
I want to use in my GUI.  I'll attach no more credence to it
then I get from FROM unless it's authenticated, but it's damn
useful to display to a user.

We have it implemented, we like it, and I'm keeping it.

Let's leave it in and define it, like FROM, as informational
only.

Or shall we remove FROM on the same basis?

In response to the question of when would authenticated referred-by's not
be required, a valid example would be in an enterprise setting where
extra-protocol means of dealing with abuse can easily be used.

Taking the original scenario that led to the discussion of the need for
authentication of Refered-By's (at least as I remember it).

a) Alice is a CEO who only accepts calls screened by her secretary Bob.

b) Carole is an employee who discovers she can call Alice directly  by
creating a fraudulent Refered-By

c) Carole calls Alice and annoys her with some petty grievances.

d) Alice calls Bob and tells him to not allow calls from Carole any more

e) Bob tells Alice that he did not put the call through and that Carole
must have did it herself with an illicit use of the telephone system

f) Alice does not, as in the originally proposed scenario, order the
immedate removal of the PBX. Instead she tells Bob to take care of the
matter
 .
g) Bob calls Carole's manager Dave and they inform her that further
incidents of this sort will lead to unpleasant consequences.

The scenario could be extended with modifications to public network
situations.

I'm not sure I see the connection between the last two sentences? How would
one make use of an unauthenticated referred-by in dealing with abusive
callers? I would tend to expect that abusive callers would be very likely
spoof refered-by headers if it is allowed.

I can accept the idea of referred-by being useful _if_ the endpoint has
another channel of authentication. I am skeptical about any real use of it
without authentication.

Considering that Robert's original question was not, "is there a use for an
unauthenticated refered-by?" but was instead "Is there use for refer if it
is published without referred-by?" with the understanding that a solid
referred-by header would be the subject of future work. From that
perspective, I have to agree with Adam's belief that referred-by should be
removed from the current draft.

   So you're saying that it's OK for me to be able
   to just put Kofi Anann's admin's name in the
   Referred-by header, so that I can get through
   his screening so we can chat about my thoughts
   on San Francisco annexing Canada?

   Groovy.

I have already pointed out that its only a SHOULD in the REFER spec "If the
URL is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the REFER request should be
copied into the request sent to the referred-to resource."

Thus removal is not required if you dont like it dont send it. Otherwise I
simply echo Brian's sentiments.

Thanks,

Sriram

Y'know, sometimes I (personally, not as chair) think we take
the security argument just a little too far.

Sure, I can finagle the From, but Referred-By is the header
I want to use in my GUI.  I'll attach no more credence to it
then I get from FROM unless it's authenticated, but it's damn
useful to display to a user.

We have it implemented, we like it, and I'm keeping it.

Let's leave it in and define it, like FROM, as informational
only.

Or shall we remove FROM on the same basis?

Brian

I agree completely with Brian.  Many vendors have already implemented
this optional part of REFER - lets just add a sentence in the security
section then begin work on the authenticated Referred-By.

Any sort of call screening must use some other authentication scheme.
For example, in the Service Examples I-D, a proxy digest provides this
authentication - it is NEVER based on From, and should not be based on
Referred-By, either.  

Thanks,

But of course there are other standard mechanisms by which you can
authenticate the caller. I was under the impression that is not currently
the case for the referror. If we _had_ a strong, agreed upon approach for
doing that, then referred-by would not be a big deal.

Robert did _not_ suggest making referred-by go away forever, just that we
link it to the effort of figuring out how to authenticate referrors, and
letting the refer draft move forward without blocking on that effort. Robert
had proposed some potential mechansism in Minneapolis, but I was under the
impression that it would take more work to complete them to the satisfaction
of the security guys.

Well, since it's okay to put George Bush's name in the FROM header,
it's got to be okay to put Kofi Anann's admin's name in the Referred-By
header.  If Mr. Annan accepts the forged FROM, he will accept the
forged referral.  

These headers are (presently) un-authenticated.  We don't DO anything
with them (presently) other than show them in a GUI.  It's useful to
do that.  I'll accept an authentication mechanism some day, but
an un-authenticated field is useful.

not in my service.  as i have said many times, we do check that the from
header matches with ones that my user is supposed to be using.  i don't
think there is any statement in the specs that says that we can't do so.
this is the same things as checking the source ip address, which we also
do.  internet would be much more user friendly if everybody would do so.

   A trip back to first principles might be a good
   idea here. Back in the 50's when my secretary
   Gladys would get me my coffee, she would also buzz
   me in my spacious office when I had an incoming call
   that I should take. Since Gladys was the source of
   my morning caffeine, her voice imprinted at very
   deep level. Thus, when I had an incoming call I
   could be quite sure that an imposter wasn't
   taking away valuable time from my helm of the
   Department of Loafing.

   Fast forward 50 years. Gladys is by and large
   history, and most assuredly the morning coffee
   she used get me is no more. Along with it went
   the deep imprinting, and the spacious office. Now I
   have to rely on a little LCD display that
   doesn't bring me coffee and now you're telling
   me that unimportant people will be able make
   their way through my screening and reach the
   inner sanctum of Loafing decision making with
   complete impunity?

   Progress. Gotta love it.

		   Mike

Dean:

The Record-Route headers in section 5.6 (in transactions F3 & F5) are in 
the wrong order.

Also, doesn't the "Path" header provide the same functionality as the 
"P-Service-Route" ?

thanks,
AC

As long as you believe it's OK for email, it's OK for SIP. How's that for some moral relativity?

In fact, it's possible to claim another persons identity without even using an IETF protocol. It's a real shame there isn't a secure protocol to eliminate social engineering. 

I think it's clear that a secure Referred-By should happen. I'm not going to suggest that we should be satisfied with unauthenticated Referred-by information.

But let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater, guys.

No. It's not. Email does not demand my immediate attention. (OK, so it does,
but I'm an email addict, and assume that not _everyone_ on this list shares
my affliction.) Email allows me to compose my thoughts, read carefully, and
respond at my leisure. The phone on the other hand rips my brain from one
context to another. It demands me to immediately shift gears to the callers
subject. I respond with a well reasoned and eloquent "huh?" as I'm trying to
remember the subject the caller wants to talk to me about. Usually this
memory recall happens some minutes after we hang up, leaving me wondering
how stupid I really did sound to the caller.

OK, I exaggerate--but the point is, interruptive, synchronous, intrusive
communication should be held to a higher authentication and authorization
standard than asynchronous communication that I can respond to when I get
good and ready.

Heh. There are technologies that _could_ be used for this, if anyone wanted
to go to the trouble. The fact that social engineering works so well is a
testament to what end users will do with unauthenticated identity info if
you let them.

No one suggested that. They only suggested not delivering the baby
prematurely, and not making the rest of refer depend on its presence.

Why would there be impunity. This can be handled as it is handled now
outside of any protocol. VIPs can use their workplace authority to prevent
unpleasnt calls as they useit to prevent unpleasant visitors. They have all
had experience with people who want to attach themsleves to certain types
of  meetings.

   A trip back to first principles might be a good
   idea here. Back in the 50's when my secretary
   Gladys would get me my coffee, she would also buzz
   me in my spacious office when I had an incoming call
   that I should take. Since Gladys was the source of
   my morning caffeine, her voice imprinted at very
   deep level. Thus, when I had an incoming call I
   could be quite sure that an imposter wasn't
   taking away valuable time from my helm of the
   Department of Loafing.

   Fast forward 50 years. Gladys is by and large
   history, and most assuredly the morning coffee
   she used get me is no more. Along with it went
   the deep imprinting, and the spacious office. Now I
   have to rely on a little LCD display that
   doesn't bring me coffee and now you're telling
   me that unimportant people will be able make
   their way through my screening and reach the
   inner sanctum of Loafing decision making with
   complete impunity?

   Progress. Gotta love it.

             Mike

Since we already have a number of implementations of non-secure Referred-By, would it be fair to call this an attempt at a late-term abortion?

Mike,

none of the headers can be trusted. If we move in a direction in 
which nothing is considered valid and useable unless authenticated, 
SIP will have a long long way to go.

   So you're saying that it's OK for me to be able
   to just put Kofi Anann's admin's name in the
   Referred-by header, so that I can get through
   his screening so we can chat about my thoughts

   Groovy.

Tom,

the same would apply to fraudulent From headers, if similar services are 
built on it. Obviously, we can then again get into the issue that the From
header can not be trusted either, but it simply happens to be what's there
today. 

Authentication may certainly be an issue, but it doesn't help to assume 
that it is always an issue. If we start doing this, then nothing in the
SIP message can be trusted and consequently we cannot build any services
(including a simple "call") with SIP as it stands today.

It is not impossible that within certain domains (e.g. a company) the 
SIP telephones in use can be configured, by design or by the system 
administrator, so the problems we are all so afraid of _can_ not occur. 
Furthermore, if someone then tries to abuse the system with a softphone 
that can get around such limitations, there are ways to "detect" that 
this phone is not a "device" that is allowed to use the system.

Headers and the message body are there to convey information, if we state
that none of this information can be trusted and that we can therefore not 

make use of them unless they are authenticated, SIP will have a long way 
to 
go before widespread adoption. 


Regards,

Frank

        Classification: 






In response to the question of when would authenticated referred-by's not
be required, a valid example would be in an enterprise setting where
extra-protocol means of dealing with abuse can easily be used.

Taking the original scenario that led to the discussion of the need for
authentication of Refered-By's (at least as I remember it).

a) Alice is a CEO who only accepts calls screened by her secretary Bob.

b) Carole is an employee who discovers she can call Alice directly  by
creating a fraudulent Refered-By

c) Carole calls Alice and annoys her with some petty grievances.

d) Alice calls Bob and tells him to not allow calls from Carole any more

e) Bob tells Alice that he did not put the call through and that Carole
must have did it herself with an illicit use of the telephone system

f) Alice does not, as in the originally proposed scenario, order the
immedate removal of the PBX. Instead she tells Bob to take care of the
matter
 .
g) Bob calls Carole's manager Dave and they inform her that further
incidents of this sort will lead to unpleasant consequences.

The scenario could be extended with modifications to public network
situations.

I'm not sure I see the connection between the last two sentences? How 
would
one make use of an unauthenticated referred-by in dealing with abusive
callers? I would tend to expect that abusive callers would be very likely
spoof refered-by headers if it is allowed.

I can accept the idea of referred-by being useful _if_ the endpoint has
another channel of authentication. I am skeptical about any real use of it
without authentication.

Considering that Robert's original question was not, "is there a use for 
an
unauthenticated refered-by?" but was instead "Is there use for refer if it
is published without referred-by?" with the understanding that a solid
referred-by header would be the subject of future work. From that
perspective, I have to agree with Adam's belief that referred-by should be
removed from the current draft.

In response to the question of when would authenticated referred-by's not<br>
be required, a valid example would be in an enterprise setting where<br>
extra-protocol means of dealing with abuse can easily be used.<br>
<br>
Taking the original scenario that led to the discussion of the need for<br>
authentication of Refered-By's (at least as I remember it).<br>
<br>
a) Alice is a CEO who only accepts calls screened by her secretary Bob.<br>
<br>
b) Carole is an employee who discovers she can call Alice directly &nbsp;by<br>
creating a fraudulent Refered-By<br>
<br>
c) Carole calls Alice and annoys her with some petty grievances.<br>
<br>
d) Alice calls Bob and tells him to not allow calls from Carole any more<br>
<br>
e) Bob tells Alice that he did not put the call through and that Carole<br>
must have did it herself with an illicit use of the telephone system<br>
<br>
f) Alice does not, as in the originally proposed scenario, order the<br>
immedate removal of the PBX. Instead she tells Bob to take care of the<br>
matter<br>
 .<br>
g) Bob calls Carole's manager Dave and they inform her that further<br>
incidents of this sort will lead to unpleasant consequences.<br>
<br>
The scenario could be extended with modifications to public network<br>
situations.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp;The information could be useful because C could authenticate the<br>
identity<br>
&gt; outside of the SIP protocol if that is felt necesary. In many cases such<br>
&gt; authentication is not required. There can be other means<br>
&gt; extra-protocol &nbsp;of<br>
&gt; dealing with abusive callers.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I see the connection between the last two sentences? How would<br>
one make use of an unauthenticated referred-by in dealing with abusive<br>
callers? I would tend to expect that abusive callers would be very likely<br>
spoof refered-by headers if it is allowed.<br>
<br>
I can accept the idea of referred-by being useful _if_ the endpoint has<br>
another channel of authentication. I am skeptical about any real use of it<br>
without authentication.<br>
<br>
Considering that Robert's original question was not, &quot;is there a use for an<br>
unauthenticated refered-by?&quot; but was instead &quot;Is there use for refer if it<br>
is published without referred-by?&quot; with the understanding that a solid<br>
referred-by header would be the subject of future work. From that<br>
perspective, I have to agree with Adam's belief that referred-by should be<br>
removed from the current draft.<br>

&gt; Why is such information useful if it's unauthenticated?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Are you planning to use it to implement policy? If so,<br>
&gt; inclusion of such a header only sets a trap for naive<br>
&gt; implementors.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If not, are you envisioning this information will be presented<br>
&gt; to users? If that's your goal, you'll want to do something<br>
&gt; that works with deployed phones. As a convention (and I'm not<br>
&gt; proposing that this be standardized), you could obtain the<br>
&gt; desired effect with something like:<br>

&gt; ...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Right?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I feel quite strongly that we should *not* include this sort of<br>
&gt; information<br>
&gt; in the current REFER draft, and work on providing an *authenticated*<br>
&gt; version of this draft at a later date.<br>

&gt; &gt; I agree with what Patrick Mourot says. Let's have a basic<br>
&gt; &gt; refer capability<br>
&gt; &gt; that provides an unsecured identity of A to C, and then leave<br>
&gt; &gt; it to C to<br>
&gt; &gt; decide whether and how to verify the identity of A. This will<br>
&gt; &gt; depend on<br>
&gt; &gt; whether it is attended or unattended transfer - with attended<br>
&gt; &gt; transfer the<br>
&gt; &gt; call A-C will exist and will be identified by the Replaces<br>
&gt; &gt; header. This may<br>
&gt; &gt; be sufficient, but if not, verification can be done in the<br>
&gt; &gt; context of that<br>
&gt; &gt; dialog A-C.<br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Sirs,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I think there are plainty of cases where C :<br>
&gt; &gt; -will not need to know that the call was started by A read in<br>
&gt; &gt; Referred-By<br>
&gt; &gt; -or will trust B (i.e: intranet cases).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Protecting Referred-By also means protecting others headers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This means that we should avoid all solutions that are not optional<br>
&gt; &gt; regarding C<br>
&gt; &gt; policy.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; A VERIFYing approach starting at C is better suited; It<br>
&gt; &gt; allows C to decide<br>
&gt; &gt; to<br>
&gt; &gt; verify or not A identity.<br>
&gt; &gt; If C does NOT want to or does NOT support VERIFY the call<br>
&gt; &gt; flows remains<br>
&gt; &gt; consistent with current behavior.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; PS: Referred-By is a means for carrying some useful Information.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That's my 2 cents.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>

Mike,

none of the headers can be trusted. If we move in a direction in 
which nothing is considered valid and useable unless authenticated, 
SIP will have a long long way to go.

   So you're saying that it's OK for me to be able
   to just put Kofi Anann's admin's name in the
   Referred-by header, so that I can get through
   his screening so we can chat about my thoughts
   on San Francisco annexing Canada?

   Groovy.

There's a major difference, though.

In the protocol, there is currently a clear way that you can respond
to me, saying "you claim to be George Bush. Prove it." (c.f. 401 and
407 responses).

There is absolutely no way that we've been able to define where you
could equivalently say, "you claim you were referred by Kofi Annan's
secretary. Prove it."

This is a fundimental problem.

The "From" field has a defined way of be challenged, but the "Referred-By"
does not. Any arguments that these are the same problem are misguided.

Now as I see it, we have a couple of camps--one is a group of people who
believe referred-by without authentication is still useful, and presumably
not _too_ harmful. A second, perhaps smaller but pretty vocal, group says
that referred-by without some authentication mechanism is dangerous.

So, to return to Robert's root question: We obviously have a lot of
discussion left on referred-by. So, can we separate the problem, move
forward the refer draft _without_ referred-by, and continue working on a
referred-by mechansism we can all agree on? I have not seen anyone argue to
scrap referred-by altogether (although that seems to be a common strawman.)

Or in otherwords, is refer so useless without referred-by that we should
block the draft until we can close this discussion?

I seem to have contradicted myself from my first transaction in this thread
to my most recent. Clearly I must be insane.


So lets separate a few issues that got me crossed up.

1) Do we need something like Referred-By at all?

2) What level of authentication security do we needed on it?

3) Do we have to solve the above two items in the REFER draft or can we work
them in a separate draft that comes after REFER.

I think RJS was originally trying to ask about 3 but I got confused and
thought we have moved to discussing 1.

Is it conceivable that a future Referred-By:
mechanism would deviate significantly from
what is currently in the draft? What will be
the impact for those who have implemented the
Referred-By: mechanism already?

Indeed I do disagree. From the very first version of this
"forbidden-name" draft, the motivation section stated the need for
providing CLIP/CLIR services while supporting call trace. SIP itself has
adopted the idea of pushing state to the endpoints for later retrieval
and we even have a more general work item building on this in the form
of state/cookies. Being able to send down an opague URI that can be used
as the target for a subsequent call trace still seems like a pretty good
idea to me. What is the problem with this and what alternative do you
suggest for the UA to invoke the trace ?

All right - I suppose we can always define a duplicate header to make

If you were to use Remote-Party-Id for the user-provided info, and
Remote-Party-Id for network-asserted identity has a way of indicating
privacy, then it would be rather silly to now require a completely
different mechanism to provide privacy for this user-provided
Remote-Party-Id.

Again, I don't think it is desirable to require a multitude of
extensions to solve a single problem. The "forbidden-name" draft as
defined today already solves this for network-asserted identity and I
don't see why I can't continue doing that.

Too small IMHO. It's basically useless without additional extensions.
Paraphrasing Jon here, it would seem that too much has now been taken
away.

Take an example of full-mesh conferencing. In that, A and B are talking.
Now, C calls B. B decides to confer with C & A, hence sends REFER to, say, C
with "Refer-To:A". To C, "Referred-By:B" is useful because, it signals
"conference" mode.

B  can add C into the conference without REFERing it to A.

Anyway, I support the idea of leaving the specification as is (i.e without 
removing the Referred-By header). However, we should definitely work 
(later) on providing extensions for authentication of the Referred-By UA.

thanks,
-AC

True. However, I'm talking about full-mesh conference, where each entity is

Referred-By should not be used to make that association.
Look at the discussion of Join in draft-sipping-cc-framework-00.

Ben,

In order to take into account :
-existing implementations,
-situations where authentication is not a problem,
-"real-life" constraints : CPU & Memory consumption and infrastructure needs
-rules applied for other SIP headers/fields (FROM, ...)
-opinions expressed in that thread,
-...

I think it is fair to let Referred-by in the draft and propose _LATER_ an  
OPTIONAL true authentication mechanism.

I hope this view will satisfy every body over there.

Best Regards,

Patrick

Well spotted! And the same thing happened to all the Via headers...
Will be corrected in the next update. Thanks for pointing this out.

In IETF SIP WG is was impossible to reach consensus on using
Path for both - originated and terminated - session cases.
Thus, the Path header will be used for terminated session
cases only, whereas the P-Service-Route header only affects
the originated session cases.

cheers,
 Bernie

Hi, 

We have submitted a new version of SIP Security Agreement draft
(ex draft-arkko-sip-sec-agree-01, now draft-ietf-sip-sec-agree-00). 

We have changed quite many details in the draft (including the 
syntax, usage of option tags, etc), and added more text on behaviors 
expected from SIP entities using the extension. We hope this version 
will now better fulfill the needs of both IETF and 3GPP. 

If you want to see the draft before it is officially available, go to: 

http://standards.ericsson.net/sip/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sec-agree-00.txt

The abstract of the draft: 

SIP has a number of security mechanisms for hop-by-hop and end-to-end
protection. Some of the security mechanisms have been built in to the
SIP protocol, such as HTTP authentication or secure attachments. In
these mechanisms there are even alternative algorithms and parameters.
Currently it isn't possible to select which security mechanisms to use
over a connection. In particular, even if some mechanisms such as
OPTIONS were used to make this selection, the selection would be vul
nerable against the Bidding-Down attack.  This document defines a
header for negotiating the security mechanisms within SIP. A SIP
entity applying this mechanism must always require some minimum secu
rity (i.e. integrity protection) from all communicating parties in
order to secure the negotiation, but the negotiation can agree on
which specific minimum security is used.

All comments are most welcome! 

Vesa

Hi,

as previously suggested in the mailing list, I have removed the reason
specific codes from the Reason draft. Until it appears in the archives,
you can fetch it from:

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/draft-ietf-sip-reason-00.txt

I would appreciate comments on the new format.

Thanks,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Extension Header for Service Route Discovery in 
                          Private Networks
	Author(s)	: D. Willis, B. Hoeneisen
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-scvrtdisco-01.txt
	Pages		: 13
	Date		: 22-Apr-02
	
This document proposes a private SIP extension header used in
conjunction with responses to REGISTER messages to provide a
mechanism by which a registrar may inform a registering UA of a
service route that the UA may use to request outbound services from
the registrar's domain.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-scvrtdisco-01.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-willis-sip-scvrtdisco-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-scvrtdisco-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

	Dear all,

referring to the draft "Use of SIP and SOAP for conference floor control", I
've been asking myself whether it is handy to use SOAP as the language to
exchange floor control related information(commands/events).My alternative
would be to define additional SIP method(s) and use some text-based
representation language in the payload for the floor control
information(extended SDP).
	My argument is that a ready made (XML) parser would be too much for the
user agent (regarding performance).Please express your against arguments, if
I am missing any.

Thanks in advance,
Kostas Katrinis
ETH Zuerich

User agents that support presence will already need to support XML.
Maybe in the future, they'll need it for SDPng. There are a number of
light-weight XML parsers that do not consume the resources that, say,
Xerces does. Generation of XML is even easier, since you can do that via
sprintf, with a locally-stored template. I doubt that having half a
dozen different text formats for different types of data is particularly
helpful in terms of overall complexity and correctness.

Bernhard:

Thanks for the clarification. I have a few more questions regarding the draft.

1) You have mentioned that P-Service-Route header is optional in REGISTER 
requests; How will the header, if present, be interpreted by the Registrar ?
2) How should the UAC interpret the order of proxies in the P-Service-Route 
header ? For eg: The UAC inverts the order of proxies in the Record-Route 
header to form a route set.
3) Also, you have mentioned that the UAC should add the P-Service-Route 
header information to the existing route set to form a new Route header 
value, which needs to be included in all origination requests. Should this 
header information be added to the beginning or the end of the route set ?
4) Should the UAC over write its existing P-Service-Route value if if gets 
a new value for P-Service-Route in 2XX response ?

It would be great if you can clarify all this information in the draft too.

thanks,
AC

Gonzalo:

Section 2 of the draft states the following:
"A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason values (i.e., multiple 
Reason lines), but all of them MUST have different protocol values (e.g., 
one SIP and another Q.850)"

Why is the restriction that the Reason values MUST have multiple protocol 
values ? For example, What if I want to provide multiple reasons (using the 
same protocol) as to why I am CANCELing a particular request ?

I don't see any need for having the restriction.

thanks,
AC

Hi,

In draft-ietf-sipping-call-flows-00.txt, there's many sections like section
2.1.1 and section 2.1.2 were the To header field is missing tag parameter,
is this a miss typed error ?, I thought per bis-0.9 SIP spec that the tag
parameter must be added to final responses as well provisional responses
except 100 (which may).

	Thanks,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Extension for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts
	Author(s)	: D. Willis
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-path-03.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 15-Apr-02
	
The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate
a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact
is generally in the form of a URI, such as Contact:
&ltsip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and
associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.  The
problem is that network topology may be that there are one or more
SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any message
from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these
proxies.  The REGISTER method itself does not give us a mechanism to
discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for
future use.  This document defines an extension header, 'Path' which
provides such a mechanism.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-03.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-willis-sip-path-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

Hello,

First of all, I need to fix the BNF in order to allow multiple Reason
lines. It will be fixed in the next release.

About your comment, which scenario do you have in mind for needing two
Reason codes using the same protocol? Could you provide us with a
particular example?

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Hi AC!

Thanks for your feedback, and pointing out these issues!
We certainly will consider those for the next version.

More comments inline.

cheers,

This is wrong in the draft (a typical copy-paste-modify
mistake...;-| ). Will be fixed in the next version.

I guess you mean here the case where more than one
P-Service-Route header entry is present, and how the order
will be in the preloaded Route.

This issue is already in the process of beeing fixed.

In section 5.1. (Procedures at the UA) it reads:
   "The UA MAY choose to exercise a service route for future messages
   associated with a given address-of-record for which a service route
   is known.  If so, it appends the given service route to any local
   required Route headers, and uses the result as a preloaded Route
   header in outgoing messages."!

The order for constructing the route-set in case there
are local Routes AND P-Service-Route should be more clarified.

I guess you are talking about re-registration.
The idea is, that the P-Service-Route of latest 200 OK
(for REGISTER) will be used. Will be clarified in the next version.

Well, the return code of the Path MAY be similar to the value of
P-Service-Route. It might not. The Path is an exact subset of the
traversal path of the REGISTER request. The P-Service-Route header could
return something completely disjoint -- it just requires that the
registrar have knowledge of some serving proxy that it is "recommending"
to the

WRT the RR headers -- I think the spec is backwards. But that's just me
. . .

Hi,

I've got a question to the provision of message integrity, 
which might be scenario specific.

SIP itself does not provide message integrity by itself. 
Instead message body integrity may be achieved by using HTTP 
Digest Authentication. This is not sufficient for many 
scenarios. Especially the security for the last hop should have 
an integrity protection that covers the complete message.

For the 3GPP networks there was a decision to have integrity 
for the last hop by using IPSec in favour of the SIP Digest 
Authentication. But for wireline networks the usage of an 
additional security protocol might not always be the best 
choice.

During IETF53 I've got the impression that people rather tend 
to go with TLS to achieve message integrity than using an 
extension to SIP. A possible extension to be used would be the 
SIP Digest Authentication (draft-undery-sip-auth-00.txt), which 
was also discussed elaborately during the last meeting. 

Did I get a wrong impression or is the TLS way really 
sufficient for most of the cases? 

Regards
	Steffen

   If you run SIP over UDP, TLS is useless and IPsec
   is a better choice. Also: the digest schemes don't
   address confidentiality.

That is true, but is confidentiallity especially for the first 
hop necessary? Imagine a scenario, where you have a SIP 
telephony service provider and a small size company uses this 
service. The company will probably have a firewall deployed. If 
you use IPSec or TLS to protect the link between the user in 
the company and the telephony service provider, the user will 
not be able to make a phone call, since the port information of 
the RTP communication is encrypted and the firewall does not 
possess the appropriate key.

   It's equally easy for me to imagine scenarios like
   cable MSO's not turing on DOCSIS BPI (which I've heard
   is quite common), wireless AP's with braindead
   L2 encryption, and DSL providers not doing
   anything at all. When you need it, you need it.

   As for the middle boxen you posit, this is the
   price of non-transparency. Your middle box will 
   have an equal amount of trouble adultering a
   message covered by a keyed hash if it doesn't
   posess a key. Some of us think this is a feature.

You are certainly right, but when no NAT/PAT is involved there 
is no need from the middle-box to alter the message. It would 
just need to trace the messages to open/close the appropriate 
ports on the firewall.

Anyway, I was interested if there are more scenarios evident 
were security in terms of message integrity protection is 
necessary and additional security protocols are not favoured to 
provide this service.

Gonzalo:

The 155 (Update Requested) response can definitely have multiple reasons.

For eg:  If authentication is required and at the same time the UAS doesn't 
support a particular extension in the request, the UAS can respond with two 
Reason codes:

Reason: SIP ;cause=401 ;text="Authentication needed"
Reason: SIP;cause=420  ;text="Bad Extension"

The corresponding headers, WWW-Authenticate & Unsupported, will provide 
more information needed in the UPDATE.

I really don't see the need in having this restriction in the specification.

thanks,
AC

Yes. We'll fix that during the authors 48 hours.

Ok, here's how this cascade started, I think.

I asked Robert to extract Referred-By from the REFER draft and publish
it as a separate draft. This does not imply that Referred-By is being
abandoned, just that it will be pursued as a separate effort. 

Why?

Because Referred-by is a 450 message (count 'em) rat-hole, and we need
REFER for other stuff like NOW.

This is an application of the time-honored technique of "divide and
conquer", and it's time to do some conquering.

Thank you!

maddr will take precedence, see draft-ietf-sip-srv. However, we are
trying to move away from the use of maddr to specify hops. Loose routing
in bis eliminates the need for it. There is really no need at all to
register with an maddr in the contact in the registration.

Hi,

Why are two drafts for ISUP to SIP mapping?
There is one in SIP WG (draft-ietf-sip-isup-03.txt)
and the other in SIPPING WG (draft-ietf-sipping-isup-01.txt).

Thanks,
Vijaya

Section 8.2.6.2 of 2543bis says a To tag MUST be added to any provisional
response (except perhaps 100 Trying).  It goes on to say:

   The same tag MUST be used for all responses to that request, both 
   final and provisional (again excepting the 100 (Trying)). 

Section 12.1 says:

   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses
   to requests with specific methods. Within this specification, only
   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag to INVITE establish a dialog.

and of course, creation of a dialog involves the UAS adding a To-tag.

What I get out of this is:

(a) If the first response to an INVITE is a failure response, a To-tag MUST
NOT be added.

(b) If the first response to an INVITE is a 1xx (greater than 100), then a
To-tag MUST be present in that response and in ALL succeeding responses,
even if the final response is a failure response.

Some unexpected tags in the call flows document stimulated this observation,
which I present for your confirmation.

Hi,

The main issue I have with 2543bis-09 is that it's not clear with clear
examples that case were To tag is needed and not, cause in latest call flows
draft which been updated to reflect 2543bis-09 it may contain missing To tag
which I hope it just an typing error, I already I sent an email early for
clarification about this.

To my understanding
* To tag is added to any provisional response and final responses to all
requests, like it shown in section 11.1 line 1783, were no to tag in OPTIONS
request but in section 11.2 line 1818 there's To tag, and so 2543bis-09 is
missing To tag in F2 message, section 24.1


* I don't think (a) is true, cause I can not find any statement in the
2543bis-.09 that prove it, plus in section 17.1.1.3 which state that ACK
message for non-2xx differ from the To header field in the original request
by the addition of the tag parameter, it does not state that a provisional
response was sent early in order to have a To tag in the ACK message

Hope this helps.

Thanks.

Section 12.1 says:

   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses
   to requests with specific methods. Within this specification, only
   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag to INVITE establish a dialog.

and of course, creation of a dialog involves the UAS adding a To-tag.

What I get out of this is:

(a) If the first response to an INVITE is a failure response, a To-tag MUST
NOT be added.

(b) If the first response to an INVITE is a 1xx (greater than 100), then a
To-tag MUST be present in that response and in ALL succeeding responses,
even if the final response is a failure response.

Some unexpected tags in the call flows document stimulated this observation,
which I present for your confirmation.

Hi,

>Determining whether a response is a
>retransmission is actually hard, and not needed.

Is this true that a UAC doesn't need to determine whether a response is a
retransmission or not?
If so, wouldn't the UAC repeat the same processing for duplicate responses
which would impact performance, especially when the response includes SDP?

Thanks,
YoungSun

Nope. This is an error in the spec. I think the right thing is to strike
the sentence entirely. The state machines are correct as defined, based
on the matching rules as defined. Determining whether a response is a
retransmission is actually hard, and not needed. Its not just the same
response code, since the same response could come from different
downstream UA. Its not a combination of response code and tags, since
the same UA could generate multiple provisional responses of the same
type (two 183, each with a different RSeq).

Thanks for pointing this out.

It seems senseless to negotiate state with an implementation that is
broken. Its sort of like trying to talk louder in an attempt to
communicate with someone that doesn't even speak your language.
Tempting, but pointless.

If something breaks badly in the negotiation, I would recommend sending
a BYE.

These are merely examples of poor practices in the wild. Once a few well

How about internal office communications, once deemed secure, to a
certain extent with the exception of a few PBX admins, which can now be
eavesdropped on by anyone with a LAN connection a sniffer, and assuming
enough knowledge to be dangerous in a switched environment, that can
capture and replay media of a confidential nature such as high level
conferencing.....

This scenario actually fits the need for additional security
protocols...but thats because I am concerned along those same lines.

Along the lines of not wanting additional security protocols...besides
issues related to dynamic pinholing, signaling modification for
NAT/NAPT, bypassing intrusion detection systems is another area of
concern. If certain signaling fields are encrypted unauthorized access
can be masked. I think that encryption of the media stream and signaling
authentication makes more sense.

I would recomend that the firewall not be the endpoint for encryption,
or if it is then it will have the pre-share key.

 /\-------| firewall|--------| VPN |----|SP VPN |----| SP Proxy |

                            or       
                     \__________IPSec____/

In the above scenario either way, the signaling must be taken care of
prior to encapsulation/decapsulation.

I agree with you, otherwise, the firewall cannot act on SIP signaling.

This only provides confidentiality between the customer Edge and the SP
edge. Internally on the customer network data is still "in the clear"

Hi,

well, in this case we would be providing functionality that does not
exist when we send a final response (rather than a 155).

Thefore, if we allow multiple Reason lines in a 155, it would be natural
to allow Reason also for final responses...

I would like to hear opinions about this.

Regards,

Gonzalo

No, there wouldn't need to be a repeat of the same processing. The state
machine for the client transaction tells you whether you need additional
processing. If a response matches the transaction, and the transaction
is in the completed state, you resend the ACK - thats it. The state
machine does not tell you to pass the response up to the TU, so no
further processing occurs.

I don't see how that is implied. Actually I think doing so would be badly 
restrictive (for example, To-tags are one way how to make an upstream UAC 
mirror piece of state in ACK).

Jiri is right - this is not implied at all. In fact, bis is quite
explicit about adding tags to all responses. Section 8.2.6.2 reads:

If a request contained a To tag in the request, the To header field in
the response MUST equal that of 1358
the request. However, if the To header field in the request did not
contain a tag, the URI in the To header 1359
field in the response MUST equal the URI in the To header field;
additionally, the UAS MUST add a tag to the To header field in the
response (with the exception of the 100 (Trying) response, in which a
tag MAY be 1361
present). This serves to identify the UAS that is responding, possibly
resulting in a component of a dialog 1362
ID. The same tag MUST be used for all responses to that request, both
final and provisional (again excepting 1363
the 100 (Trying)). Procedures for generation of tags are defined in
Section 19.3. 1364


The second sentence above is explicit that the UAS MUST add a tag to the
To header in the response, and the only exception is 100 trying. This
section is not specific to any type of response, and presents general
guidelines for constructing a response. Thus, it applies to all
responses except the 100 trying.

I would rather not allow this, for the reason Gonzalo cites. The normal
processing of a request does not allow multiple error reports in a
single response. Since the generation of 155 is based on following the
normal request processing, but just changing the value of the status
code, it should not be possible to see multiple error status codes in
the 155.

The confusing word here is "behavior". In this context, it is meant to
refer to processing of this requet at layers above the transaction
layer. I agree it could be clearer. We will try to reword during authors
49 hours.

The issue shouldn't be whether there are clear examples, but whether there 
is
clear specification text. In cases where the specification leads to 
difficult
to read text to make the text correct, examples can be given.

Regards,

Frank



Hi,

The main issue I have with 2543bis-09 is that it's not clear with clear
examples that case were To tag is needed and not, cause in latest call 
flows
draft which been updated to reflect 2543bis-09 it may contain missing To 
tag
which I hope it just an typing error, I already I sent an email early for
clarification about this.

To my understanding
* To tag is added to any provisional response and final responses to all
requests, like it shown in section 11.1 line 1783, were no to tag in 
OPTIONS
request but in section 11.2 line 1818 there's To tag, and so 2543bis-09 is
missing To tag in F2 message, section 24.1


* I don't think (a) is true, cause I can not find any statement in the
2543bis-.09 that prove it, plus in section 17.1.1.3 which state that ACK
message for non-2xx differ from the To header field in the original 
request
by the addition of the tag parameter, it does not state that a provisional
response was sent early in order to have a To tag in the ACK message

Hope this helps.

Thanks.

Subject:                 [Sip] To-tag Corner Case

Section 8.2.6.2 of 2543bis says a To tag MUST be added to any provisional
response (except perhaps 100 Trying).  It goes on to say:

   The same tag MUST be used for all responses to that request, both
   final and provisional (again excepting the 100 (Trying)).

Section 12.1 says:

   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses
   to requests with specific methods. Within this specification, only
   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag to INVITE establish a dialog.

and of course, creation of a dialog involves the UAS adding a To-tag.

What I get out of this is:

(a) If the first response to an INVITE is a failure response, a To-tag 
MUST
NOT be added.

(b) If the first response to an INVITE is a 1xx (greater than 100), then a
To-tag MUST be present in that response and in ALL succeeding responses,
even if the final response is a failure response.

Some unexpected tags in the call flows document stimulated this 
observation,
which I present for your confirmation.

Encryption of the media stream in corporate environments is

Does this mean you would favour signaling authentication rather 
than signaling integrity? Is the reason for this the support of 
NAT/NAPT?

Folks,

I have put together a draft about how to use SigComp and SIP.

Until it appears in the archives, you can fetch it from:
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/draft-camarillo-sip-compression-00.txt

Note that this draft does *not* describe a DNS based approach.

As usual, feedback is welcome.

Regards,

Gonzalo

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Security Mechanism Agreement for SIP Sessions
	Author(s)	: J. Arkko et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-sec-agree-00.txt
	Pages		: 16
	Date		: 24-Apr-02
	
SIP has a number of security mechanisms for hop-by-hop and end-to-end
protection. Some of the security mechanisms have been built in to the
SIP protocol, such as HTTP authentication or secure attachments. In
these mechanisms there are even alternative algorithms and parameters.
Currently it isn't possible to select which security mechanisms to use
over a connection. In particular, even if some mechanisms such as
OPTIONS were used to make this selection, the selection would be vul
nerable against the Bidding-Down attack.  This document defines a
header for negotiating the security mechanisms within SIP. A SIP
entity applying this mechanism must always require some minimum secu
rity (i.e. integrity protection) from all communicating parties in
order to secure the negotiation, but the negotiation can agree on
which specific minimum security is used.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sec-agree-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader

The correct use of tags is shown in Section 11 with the OPTIONS.
Section 24.1 does contain an error in the lack of a To tag in the
response to the REGISTER.  This is the same error in the Call Flows.

The only change to tag usage in the Call Flows documents relates to
proxy behavior in forwarding non-2xx final responses.  It the past, the
call flows showed proxies replacing the existing tag in the non-2xx
response with its own tag.  Now, if possible, the proxy keeps the tag
when it proxies the response, which can help in troubleshooting -
figuring out which server sent the error.

Gonzalo,

I think this is definitely a step in the right direction. I'll note that
this is yet another thing that wouldn't work without loose routing :)

A few comments:

* Section 3 leaves out an important means for obtaining the URI -
configuration. Ultimately, we want to move towards configuration of
outbound proxies through URIs, NOT IP addresses. One reason is that we
can support supplemantal information, just like this, as part of the
URI. 

* I think a client MUST NOT send a sigcomp request to a server if it
doesn't know whether it supports compression. Section 3 provides cases
in which you can sort of guess whether it does. I don't like that. The
guesses are just that - guesses, and may be wrong. Indeed, the
heuristics are somewhat ill defined. For example:

>  o In a previous transaction, the client obtained a URI for the
>           same server with the parameter comp=sigcomp (e.g., a Contact
>           header field in a 2xx response for a previous OPTIONS request
>           or an entry in the route set of a previous dialog).

How do I know that the OPTIONS request this time was routed to the same
element that got it last time? Indeed, if, last time, the contact URI in
the 2xx to OPTIONS had a comp param, and this time, it doesn't, isn't
this a good sign that it has NOT been routed to the same UA?


* I think its worth noting a few things about this approach. First, a
proxy that gets a request uncompressed, and wants to get it compressed
in subsequent requests, can return a 301 with a contact header that has
the comp parameter. This will result in a caching of the binding in the
client that sent the request. Secondly, a SIP element that implements
this will need to be prepared to receive compressed or uncompressed
messages on the same port, and thus will need to look at the cookie in
the topmost bits to demux.

I would say MUST NOT be compressed. The criteria is - will things work
if you violate this? If I send a compressed response to something which
doesn't support it, the response is discarded. The result is total
failure of the transaction. There is no recovrey. So, it should be MUST
NOT.

Why? If the upstream element doesn't support this extension, the sigcomp
parameter is ignored, and the message is sent uncompressed. Thats what
you want. The decision about whether to insert a URI with the comp
parameter should be entirely a local one.

* section 7 - i think these considerations are addressed by sigcomp
itself. You should really discuss whether the proposed mechanism
introduces additional issues.


Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Currently in SIP, a non-2xx final response contains the reason why the
session failed (in case the request was establishing a session, to
begin with).  A non-2xx final response is *not* the aggregation of all
particular reasons why the response failed.  I think that allowing such
an aggregation would be an invitation to open a can of worms as one
figures out which headers to include/preclude in an aggregated response
(not to mention the receiving side, which will have to deduce what went
wrong based on presence/absence of such headers).

Furthermore, what if 2 things went wrong, but fixing one automatically
fixes the other (for instance, a UAS received a very long R-URI with an
unknown scheme, so it sends 2 Reason headers, one containing 414
"Request-URI too long" and the other 416 "Unsupported URI Scheme".  A
UAC may attempt to fix 414 by using an alternate shorter R-URI, which
just happens to be a URI that contains a scheme that the UAS
understands).

I think what the I-D says right now:

   "A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason values (i.e.,
   multiple Reason lines), but all of them MUST have different
   protocol values (e.g., one SIP and another Q.850)"

should stand.  This mirrors the current response behavior in SIP.

Regards,

- vijay

In case of 1xx received, the INVITE client transaction in the Proceeding
state tells you to pass the response up to the TU. In this case, is the TU
responsible for determining the duplicate response or for repeating the
same processing treating the duplicate response as a new response?

Hi All,

I've submitted an updated version of the Digest-AKA draft to the I-D directories. Until it appears there, a copy is available at:

	http://www.iki.fi/aki.niemi/draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-01.txt

This version includes mostly editorial changes and some clarifications with an updated section on IANA considerations.

Comments are welcome!

Cheers,
Aki

Abstract

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework
   includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes
   employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
   The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism performs user
   authentication and session key distribution in Universal Mobile
   Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-
   response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.  This memo
   specifies an AKA based one-time password generation mechanism for
   HTTP Digest access authentication.

Then must the statement I quote from 12.1 be fixed, or did I go too far in
equating the addition of a To-tag to establishment of a dialog?

Jiri is right - this is not implied at all. In fact, bis is quite
explicit about adding tags to all responses. Section 8.2.6.2 reads:

If a request contained a To tag in the request, the To header field in
the response MUST equal that of 1358
the request. However, if the To header field in the request did not
contain a tag, the URI in the To header 1359
field in the response MUST equal the URI in the To header field;
additionally, the UAS MUST add a tag to the To header field in the
response (with the exception of the 100 (Trying) response, in which a
tag MAY be 1361
present). This serves to identify the UAS that is responding, possibly
resulting in a component of a dialog 1362
ID. The same tag MUST be used for all responses to that request, both
final and provisional (again excepting 1363
the 100 (Trying)). Procedures for generation of tags are defined in
Section 19.3. 1364


The second sentence above is explicit that the UAS MUST add a tag to the
To header in the response, and the only exception is 100 trying. This
section is not specific to any type of response, and presents general
guidelines for constructing a response. Thus, it applies to all
responses except the 100 trying.

For a bis compliant element, there is no differing treatment of
duplicate provisional responses. All are forwarded upstream by proxies,
all are associated with a dialog and possibly rendered to the user at a
UA. The reliability of provional responses spec defines reliability for
1xx, which has a notion of retransmits. It provides a separate header
used to determine retransmits. That processing is not done at the
transaction layer, but in the TU.

I don't like this. It effectively requires us to register two response
codes for every repairable error response. I would rather use Reason,
thats what its meant for.

This section is meant to overview operation, and doesn't specify
normative behavior. So, I don't want to get into details. I reworded to
say:

Afterwards,
the UAC can generate an UPDATE method that contains
an SDP offer \citenorm{draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-offer-answer} for the
purposes of updating the session.

There are two different conditions here:

Condition 1: the UAS sent a 155. In this case, the UAC really needs to
send an update to get it out of the wait state it is in. This is the
reason for the MUST level inclusion of Require in the 155. Effectively,
processing of the 155 requires an extension, and that extension is
separate from the support of the UPDATE method.

Condition 2: the uAS just sent a vanilla reliable provisional response
(i.e., 183). The UAC can send an update if it likes. UPDATE is a method
supported by the UAS. So, it is included in an Allow header, just like
any other method. Thus, the text in 5.3 is wrong, since it says
Supported. It needs to say Allow. Allow is mentioned in section 5.1 as
something the UAC can include. It is supposed to be symmetric.

OK, I think that is sensible.

Folks,

As I was integrating comments on UPDATE for the final rev for iesg, I
begin to rethink our decision on keeping the HERFP stuff (155) as part
of this draft. The current usage really specifies to behaviors; they
even have different ways of indicating support for them (Allow: UPDATE
and Supported/Require: update). So, I would like to propose that we
excise the HERFP stuff, and proceed with UPDATE alone as a mechanism for
modifying session parameters. 

Here are some of the pros/cons:

pros:

  + cleaner separation of what is probably two separate things
  + we can revert to using the Reason header, since that aspect of it
would go in the HERFP document, not in UPDATE baseline
  + the HERFP stuff is a little immature still. I would prefer to have
some implementation experience with it before going to RFC.
  + the HERFP stuff is less time sensitive; we need UPDATE for the
purposes of session modification (manyfolks needs it)

cons:

  - somewhat major change at a fairly late point in the game, although
it should be fairly easy to excise


Comments?

No I would prefer both actually, but I am inclined to be one of the more
paranoid.  :^)

But yes the reasoning for my comment is due to the fact that to permit
signaling through sip enabled nat/napt, at a minimum the SDP must not be
encrypted. That is not to say that I dont want full encryption....I do,
but thats another discussion and a different topic.

Hi,


	I have a doubt regarding the concept of a dialog when a session 
is made up by several participants.


	is there any relation between the call-id of all the dialogs that 
make up a session?


	Here is an extract from rfc-2543-bis09 


<bold><color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param>Abstract

</bold>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control 
(signaling) protocol for creating, <FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller><smaller>15

<FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger><bigger>modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants. <FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller><smaller>16




<bigger><bigger>(309) ...<FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>. SIP can also invite participants to already existing 
sessions, such as multicast conferences.</color><FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>


 (line 594) <color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>The most important method in SIP is the <FontFamily><param>Arial</param>INVITE 
<FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param>method, which is used to establish a session between participants. 
A session is a collection of participants, and streams of media 
between them,... Section 13 discusses how sessions are initiated, 
resulting in one or more SIP dialogs.


(2069) when multiple 2xx responses are received from different 
remote UAs (because the <FontFamily><param>Arial</param>INVITE <FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param>forked), each 2xx establishes a 
different dialog. All these dialogs are part of the sa
me call.


	Now<FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller> it seems to me that all these participants correspond to 
the endpoint where a single user can be reached, what about the 
other "participants" in the session? How are they "invited"? Are two 
different concepts of session being used here, namely, at a sip 
signalling level with only endpoint, and at a call level?


thanks,

Salva</color>

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Security Mechanism Agreement for SIP Sessions
	Author(s)	: J. Arkko et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-sec-agree-00.txt
	Pages		: 16
	Date		: 24-Apr-02
	
SIP has a number of security mechanisms for hop-by-hop and end-to-end
protection. Some of the security mechanisms have been built in to the
SIP protocol, such as HTTP authentication or secure attachments. In
these mechanisms there are even alternative algorithms and parameters.
Currently it isn't possible to select which security mechanisms to use
over a connection. In particular, even if some mechanisms such as
OPTIONS were used to make this selection, the selection would be vul
nerable against the Bidding-Down attack.  This document defines a
header for negotiating the security mechanisms within SIP. A SIP
entity applying this mechanism must always require some minimum secu
rity (i.e. integrity protection) from all communicating parties in
order to secure the negotiation, but the negotiation can agree on
which specific minimum security is used.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Hi all,

In message-waiting-02 draft, hname in message-summery 
syntax is given as 

message-headers = hname ":" SP hvalue CRLF 
hname = #(alphanum | "-" | "_")

i think it should be 1* in place of #. bcos if multiple
hname comes according rfc2543bis-02 will be separated by comma.


summary-line = media-type ":" SP new "/" old  [ urgent ] CRLF 
   new = WHOLENUMBER 
   old = WHOLENUMBER 
   new-urgent = WHOLENUMBER 
   old-urgent  = WHOLENUMBER 
   WHOLENUMBER = *DIGIT 

in the above syntax WHOLENUMBER should be 1*Digit.
bcos * means zero or multiples.

Anybody clarify abt the following syntax.

Thanks 
Lakshmi

I've just submitted three new refer related drafts.
Until they hit the repository, you can get them at

http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/draft-sparks-sip-mimetypes-03.txt
http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/draft-sparks-sip-refer-split-00.txt
http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/draft-sparks-sip-referredby-split-00.txt

Mimetypes is ready to go I think.

I propose resubmitting refer-split-00 as refer-03 and sending that 
through last call and to the IESG now.

We can then continue our discussion of referred-by in the 
referredby-split draft.


RjS

p.s. I will be online for a few more hours, and then only
intermittently until the interim meeting.

I should clarify this further by stating that I would like to see full
encryption of signaling and media, but I dont want to hamper the efforts
of firewall vendors in their effort to facilitate SIP, which most have
done or are in process of doing. There are now at least 5 B2BUA style
firewall products and 3 application layer gateway style firewall vendors
with firewall solutions available or about to be available. There are
also about 5 other vendors providing other alternatives to firewalls to
address private address space and/or dynamic pinhole capability for SIP.
Many of these are well known vendors. 

Also many clients offer NAT features that would be useless with this
level of encryption initially.

It almost appears that to provide the level of integrity and
confidentiality that may be required in the future, the requirement
would be to provide a VPN capability in the client for media and
signaling and to proxy all such traffic to a carrier based VPN gateway
for decapsulation/encapsulation or between endpoints for the same
action. But then you get to the private address issues again and
circumvention of security policy (IDS cant detect unauthorized
communcations, firewalls cant enforce security policy via filters,
etc...).

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: HTTP Digest Authentication Using AKA
	Author(s)	: A. Niemi, J. Arkko, V. Torvinen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-01.txt
	Pages		: 18
	Date		: 25-Apr-02
	
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework
includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes
employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism performs user
authentication and session key distribution in Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-
response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.  This memo
specifies an AKA based one-time password generation mechanism for
HTTP Digest access authentication.

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I'd like to request final wg comments on the newly-renamed:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sec-agree-00.txt


Jari Arkko will coordinate feedback. We hope to bump this to IETF Last
Call on April 30. Of course, one can still make comments even then, but
it's time we hatched this egg (do you eggree?).

Hi Robert,

Good job on the cutting out Referred-By from the main REFER draft. Small
nit:

1. draft-sparks-sip-referredby-split-00.txt section 3.3.2.2 - not sure why
we need to reproduce the multiple REFER case. Anyways if you prefer to keep
it, then please change 'cseq' -to-> 'id' in the Event header of flow F7.
2. The events-draft
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-events-05.txt) in
section 8.2 show that the header Subscription-State is mandatory in a NOTIFY
request. We never use this header in the two REFER drafts (refer-split and
referredby-split). It is my opinion that we have to have this header to be
in compliance with the events draft.

Regards,

Sriram

I've just submitted three new refer related drafts.
Until they hit the repository, you can get them at

http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/draft-sparks-sip-mimetypes-03.txt
http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/draft-sparks-sip-refer-split-00.txt
http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/draft-sparks-sip-referredby-split-00.txt

Mimetypes is ready to go I think.

I propose resubmitting refer-split-00 as refer-03 and sending that 
through last call and to the IESG now.

We can then continue our discussion of referred-by in the 
referredby-split draft.


RjS

p.s. I will be online for a few more hours, and then only
intermittently until the interim meeting.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: HTTP Digest Authentication Using AKA
	Author(s)	: A. Niemi, J. Arkko, V. Torvinen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-01.txt
	Pages		: 18
	Date		: 25-Apr-02
	
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework
includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes
employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism performs user
authentication and session key distribution in Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-
response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.  This memo
specifies an AKA based one-time password generation mechanism for
HTTP Digest access authentication.

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-digest-aka-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Some comments on draft-willis-sip-path-03 :

The draft states that any proxy processing a REGISTER request can add its
own URI or a Path element referencing another node to the REGISTER message.
For the response to the REGISTER, it states that "The registrar reflects the
accumulated Path back into the REGISTER response, and intermediate nodes
propogate this back toward the originating UA". There is no mention of how a
proxy can add or modify the Path headers in the response. But in the
addition of Path to SIP Table 2, the Path in 2xx is marked as "amr", where a
= add and m = modify. Is this a typo ?

The Path header is supposed to have a "syntax very similar to the
Record-Route header". SIP bis-09 states that "The URI placed in the
Record-Route header field value MUST be a SIP URI. This URI  MUST contain an
lr parameter". I think this should be a requirement for the Path header too
and should be mentioned in the draft.

Two minor side comments :

- The addition of Path to SIP Table 2 should be to Table 3 instead. Table 3
is for header fields starting with P-Z.

- Path header should be added to Table 1 of bis-09 too.

- In the example message flow, the ordering of the two Path elements in F6
should be reversed.

Hi folks,

Sorry about the confusion. I'm a bit behind on the SIP list and just read
the draft-willis-sip-path-03 and commented on it. Then I discovered the
revised service route discovery draft and thought that it was supposed to
replace the Path draft. However, it seems that the Path header draft still
stands according to the following mail. Or does it not ?

In IETF SIP WG is was impossible to reach consensus on using
Path for both - originated and terminated - session cases.
Thus, the Path header will be used for terminated session
cases only, whereas the P-Service-Route header only affects
the originated session cases.

The special arragement option depends on how the network operator deals with
providing it.
 
If the network operator gives it to all and everyone, then it is as you say.
Essentially as the From field. This requires no further consideration.
 
When it was specified however, one major use was identified as being from
enterprise networks, in fact they were the main proponents of such a usage.
If one follows the private network ISDN signalling specifications (ISO PSS1
and ECMA QSIG) then enterprise delivered values are screened in the
enterprise network, thus as far as the enterprise network is concerned, they
are regarded as network asserted rather than as user asserted. The only
reason for the special arrangement coding (user provided unscreened) in this
case is that the public network operators wanted a distinction between
public network asserted identities and private network asserted identities. 
 
So far the point is therefore that while enterprise networks can and do
assert identities, they may not be fully trusted. In the ISDN, it is trusted
sufficiently in order to deliver the CLIP service to the remote user, but is
not trusted sufficiently for malicious call identification. If we are to
achieve 100% mapping to the ISDN/PSTN, then we may need to reflect this
distinction.
 
I certainly do not believe that we should treat the unscreened coding in all
cases as mapping to the From header, as this will not give a 100% mapping in
the reverse direction. However, in the longer term, providing some values
indicating who provided the assertion may resolve this problem. In this case
dummy values such as "non-public network operator" could be used as the
asserting identity when such values are mapped.
 
In the short term, as a large number of public network operators do not
allow the special arrangement to exist, it may be best to ignore the special
arrangement, or at least the finer details of the mapping.
 
Keith

I think we're about at the end of this one. 

Two final points from me: 
1) Dean's desire to avoid having the From: field mangled unless he has
specifically requested it is reasonable. I still think  that the
subscriber's wishes could overrule this though.

This is no different from the ISDN 'Special Arrangement' where the user
inserts any number they like in the Calling Party Number field. The network
passes it though with no checking, changing, nothing - I think this is
analogous to what Dean wants for the From field.

But the network still removes this information if the subscriber wants
anonymity. The stated purpose of the field is user identity, which implies
Personal Data of the subscriber. This is enough to argue that the network
must remove it if privacy is required, and this is certainly the application
of current legislation to ISDN.

What is the stated purpose of the From field - I do not think it is
sufficiently different for us to be _sure_ that we can avoid the
requirement.

So, the munging may still be required, but I certainly agree it should be
avoided wherever possible. 

2) In formal terms, 'B2BUA == NOT Proxy'. We all know there will be/are
devices which behave very much like a proxy, but perform some additional
functions, such as these privacy services. This is fine. Everyone should be
aware that with only two terms defined 'B2BUA' and 'Proxy', such devices
fall into the B2BUA category.

	Title		: The SIP Access Network Info header
	Author(s)	: D. Mills
	Filename	: draft-mills-sip-access-network-info-00.txt
	Pages		: 
	Date		: 26-Apr-02
	
This document defines the private SIP extension header
P-Access-Network-Info. This mechanism is useful in SIP networks that
are partitioned, such as 3G wireless networks which are partitioned at
the SIP layer into 'access' and 'home' networks. SIP User Agents may
use this header to relay information about the access network to
serving proxies in their home network. The serving proxy may then use
this information to optimize services for the UA. For example, a 3GPP
terminal uses this header to pass information about the access network
such as radio access technology and cell ID to its home service.

Hi:

I have just submitted 3 new internet drafts about 3 new P- headers.
They will probably be available in the IETF repository in the next few days. In the meantime, you can download them from:

| Well, the return code of the Path MAY be similar to the value of
| P-Service-Route. It might not. The Path is an exact subset of the
| traversal path of the REGISTER request. 

No, it needs not be. draft-willis-sip-path-03 states that "It is also
possible for a proxy with specific knowledge of network topology to add a
path element referencing another node, thereby allowing construction of a
Path which is discongruent with the route taken by the REGISTER request".

It is not clear to me whether the Path header and the P-Service-Route header
can co-exist in a 200 OK response to a REGISTER. If Path header exists in
the REGISTER request, the Path draft expects the registrar to reflect
accumulated Path back into the REGISTER response. The Service-Route draft on
the other hand says that the registrar may choose to return a
P-Service-Route header in any successful 200 OK response. Should the
registrar not return the Path if it wants to insert the Service-Route ?

Regards,
Ya-Ching

Ah! Thanks for pointing that out. That paragraph is left over from an
earlier version of the draft, and needs to be deleted. My fault. Thanks
for the careful reading!

They may both be present.

Hello
     I have doubt regarding the following  statement of the
draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-08.txt

"The UAC MUST insert the Min-SE header into a re-INVITE request for a
particular call leg if it has ever received a 422 response to a   previous
INVITE on the same leg"

When a UAC receives 422 response for a INVITE request, it retries with by
removing the tag field.
So once the call is established, there will not be any Min-SE for that call
leg.

The example in draft also says same thing.

What value in the Min-SE header should go out ?.


The draft also specifes

"In an INVITE that is   within a call leg with an active session timer, the
header SHOULD be   present, and SHOULD contain the the larger of the
current value of   the session interval and the value of the Min-SE, if
present"

So how can be the re-INVITE get 422 response, so that next re-INVITE will
go out with Min-SE header.


Any replies,suggestions,pointers in this regard would be helpful.

Gonzalo:

Some comments, divided into nits and non-nits comments.

Non-nits comments
-----------------
1) The I-D says that:
    "Initially, the Reason header field defined here appears to be
     most useful for BYE and CANCEL requests, but it can appear in
     any request"

    I seem to recall on the list that the Reason header field was limited
    to requests within a dialog only.  Is this restriction no longer
    applicable.  The I-D implies that a request generated, for instance,
    by a 3PCC controller establishing a session with party B may contain
    a Reason header.

2) If I am not mistaken, the ABNF restricts the Reason field to appear
    only once.  Since it can appear multiple times in a SIP message (and
    be separable by commas), we should change the ABNF to reflect this.

Nits comments
-------------
1) The ABNF of Reason sets the Protocol field to:
    Protocol = SIP / Q.850 / token
    but the paragraph under the ABNF states that the value "SIP/2.0" has
    been defined for a SIP status code.  However, the examples still
    contain the value "SIP", not "SIP/2.0".  To be consistent, we should
    either mention the value "SIP" in the paragraph below the ABNF, or
    change the ABNF and examples to contain "SIP/2.0".

2) The following paragraph appears run-on:
    "When an INVITE is rejected, not because the call is declined,
    but because some aspect of the request was not acceptable, if
    the INVITE was forked, the error response is not forwarded
    towards the UAC by the forking proxy. This problem is known
    as..."
    Suggested modifications:
    "An INVITE can sometimes be rejected not because the session
    initiation was declined, but becuause some aspect of the request
    was not acceptable; for instance, if the INVITE forked and
    resulted in a rejection, which may never be forwarded to the
    client unless all the other branches also reject the request.
    This problem is known as ..."

3) The four examples in Section 2 correspond roughly to the examples
    of section 3.  Maybe they should be repeated (or presented for
    the first time) in the relevant sub-sections of Section 3.

Thanks,

- vijay

Ok, it's apparently my day for making stupid responses. I hope it's not
becoming a habit.

Please allow me to clarify what I meant to say (as opposed to what I
actually said, which was wrong).

A proxy adding a Path element to a REGISTER request MAY construct that
element so that it actually refers to a different proxy. It's actually
possible to do something similar in Record-Route, although I'm not aware
of any systems that have actually implemented this. 

So it is not technically correct to say that the Path is an exact subset
of traversal path of the RESGISTER. Rather, it is "usually" an exact
subset of the traversal path of the REGISTER.

But this is still very different from the value returned by
P-Service-Route.

From the UA's perspective, the Path response means "These are the
proxies that have been added to my registration, such that messages
going from my home proxy to me will visit these proxies". It deals with
UA-terminated messages, i.e., when the UA us acting as a UAS.

From the UA's perspective, the P-Service-Route response means "This is a
route set that I can combine with other routing knoweldge I may have so
that I can get services from a particular set of service proxies." It
deals with UA-originated messages, i.e., when the UA is acting as a UAC.

Some comments on -09bis on Timers C, B, and spiraling:

1) In SIP, proxies can fork either in serial or in parallel.  Consider
    serial forking for this discussion.  Normally, in the presence of
    multiple Contact headers to an address-of-record, a proxy will sort
    the Contacts based on their q value and fork serially to each
    Contact.  If Contact 1 did not elicit a final response within a
    certain time, Contact 2 will be tried, and so on.  Problem is,
    what exactly is the time for a proxy to give up on the current
    Contact and try the next one?

    Reading -09bis, it appears that timer C can serve this function.
    But the initial value of timer C is too high (3 minutes, and it is
    a MUST to set it to at least 3 mins), so that will not work.  Another
    possible candidate is the transaction timeout; if a proxy allows a
    client transaction to continue (T1*64 seconds = 32 seconds) until it
    times out, the time between trying the next Contact (32 seconds) is
    too large for the caller to keep holding.  So, this does not work
    either.

    Should -09bis provide some guidance on timers to use in proxy cores
    if serial forking is being used and > 1 Contact header is present,
    or should this be left upto the implementer?

2) Timer B controls transaction timeouts in INVITE client trans-
    actions.  The state diagram in Figure 5 is silent on what to
    do if Timer B fires while control is in "Proceeding" state; i.e.
    received a 180, but no final response.  The correct behavior
    should be to sent a CANCEL and enter "Terminated" state.

3) Regarding finding the spiraled R-R on responses in order to
    modify it (section 16.7, step 8), won't it be the case that
    the first R-R in a response corresponds to the inner-most
    spiral?  Since the inner-most spiral will generate the first
    response, can't we just get the first R-R header on a response
    in order to modify it?

If I mis-represented something and the solution is in -09bis, please
let me know.

Thanks,

Duncan:

Section 6, paragraph 2 says:
"The P-Access-Network-Info header MAY be inserted by a UA. Proxies, MUST 
NOT add to or modify the contents of the P-Access Network-Info".

However, in the formal definition of "P-Access-Network-Info" we have the 
values of "acm" for proxies. This contradicts the previous statement.

AC

I've submitted -02 of the P-Service-Route header to internet-drafts. In
the meantime, you can get it from:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-02.txt

l
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-willis-sip-svcrtdisco-02.xml

I think this is getting fairly close to final. Please eyeball it
carefully.

This draft is an individual informational documenting a P-header
requested by 3GPP. We'll be processing it by "expert review". Current
plans require review to be complete by May 10 or thereabouts.

Thanks,

You've already seen a few and will see many more requests for us to
provide expert review for P-header drafts.

P-headers, if you haven't been following, are "private, preliminary, or
proprietary" extension headers. They are published as informational
drafts, general as individual contributions. The process is set out in
draft-tsv-sipchange and is based on the process defined in RFC 2026 for
informational documents.

Expert Review is basically the equivalent of a Working Group Last Call
for this sort of draft. It should take a couple of weeks, and may
involve multiple updates of the document. As always, getting feedback to
the editors as soon as reasonably possible is a Good Thing.

Our tasks in reviewing these include:

1) Establish that the document is "publication grade" for IETF -- in the
right format, properly referenced, and effectively using requirements
language. Bascially, a "nits review".

2) Detect significant overlaps with chartered general purpose work. In
general, we wish to avoid P-headers that overlap with some problem we've
already identified and are working on solving, especially if the general
solution is near-term.

3) Detect serious security issues. P-headers MAY proceed with security
questions, but we need to make sure that the issues are adequately
documented and will probably propose fixes.

4) Look for underlying generalities that we may use to guide our work
going forward. We may notice multiple occurrences of certain clases of
problems cropping up, which often means that there is some underlying
more general problem which if solved would produce broad benefits.

Thanks,

Hi,

I just submitted an update to replaces.  This draft has a substantial
change, in that it specifies Proxy behavior for replacing early dialogs.
(The proxy behavior is only pertinent to forking proxies).  The proposed
mechanism should work, but it is complex.  We can either:

a) leave the proposed mechanism in the draft,
b) explicitly choose not to address call control for early dialogs, or
c) split out matching of transactions at forking proxies in another draft

I invite your comments on this (hopefully last) open issue.

Until it appears in the archive, you can fetch a copy from the
supplemental web site.  An html version is also available.

Dean:

Some comments:

Section 1:
    "UA wishes to register with REGISTRAR. However, due to network
    topology, UA must use P1 as an "outbound proxy", and all messages
    between UA1 and REGISTRAR must also traverse P1, P2, and P3 before
            ^^^
    reaching REGISTRAR."

There isn't any UA1, only "UA".  To be consistent with Section 4.5 and
4.6, you may want to re-label "UA" in the figure to "UA1".

In the sentence,

    "Eventually, REGISTRAR or a service proxy closely related to it
    will receive a message for UA. It needs to know which proxies
    must be transited by that message in order to get back to UA..."

we are talking about *request* initiated by the REGISTRAR destined to
UA, right?  If so, can't we reword it as:

    "Eventually, REGISTRAR or a service proxy closely related to it
    will need to send a request to the UA.  It needs to know which
    proxies must be transited by that request in order to get to UA..."

Generally speaking, in many places where you use "message", I believe
you mean "requests".  If so, can we substitute the term request, since
a "message" may be a response, for instance, which will follow the
Via paths.

In Section 4.6, the requests from P1->P2 show P1 adding itself to
the Path list (initially set to null).  The branch of P1 does NOT
contain the "magic cookie" (z9hG4bK).  Likewise for P3->REGISTRAR.
Since P1 and P3 supports "lr", it is a good bet that they also support
the Via "magic cookie".  Of course, this is an obscure nit, but all the
same...

Thanks,

Dean:

Some comments:

Section 1, bullet 5:
    5. Performing an operation equivalent to record-routing in a
       REGISTER transaction between the UA and the associated
       registrar, then storing that route in the UA and reusing it
       as a service route on future messages originating from the UA.
       While efficient, this constrains the service route for proxy
       operations to be congruent with the route taken by the REGISTER
       message.

I interpret the last sentence as follows:
    "While efficient, this constrains the service route for proxy
     operations to be congruent with the Route set formed at the UA
     from the Path headers in a 200 OK (REGISTER)."

On an initial read of this I-D, I thought that the Path extension may
help.  However, the problem appears to be, if we use the Path extension,
that the service route will necessarily be equivalent to the one
formed when a Path-header knowledgable UA gets back a 200 OK (REGISTER)
with multiple Paths.  At least to me, this was not immediately apparent
from the wording in bullet 5. I don't know if my suggested wording
makes it more easier to understand or not...

Also, should the Path I-D be referenced here?

Also, what happens if a 200 OK (REGISTER) has multiple Path headers
*and* a P-Service-Route header?  The I-D does provide some guidance
in Section 5.1: "In general, the service route set is appended to any
locally configured route needed to egress the access proxy chain."
I think this should be highlighted and maybe included in the examples
in Section 5.

That's all.  Thanks.

Actually, I'm thinking a third party will send a request to REGISTRAR
(it's a proxy too, right) that is detined for UA. The mindset is a "home
service proxy".

Yep, that's what I meant. I was just trying not to refer to Path draft .

Then I have failed to make something clear. Path and P-Service-Route are
completely independent in specification.

The Path header reports a proxy sequence, associated with a specific
registration, that will be traversed by requests that have visited the
home service proxy associated with the registrar. This is "just so the
UA knows who's in the loop". It is not used, in any way whatsover, to
route messages out of the UA.

The P-Service-Route header provides a proxy sequence that the UA MAY use
in order to request services from a specific proxy cluster.

They MAY have some of the same values in them, just as two different
INVITES may also traverse the same proxy.


How can I make this more clear?

Any idea why the reluctance?

Right; on closer introspection, disregard what I wrote above; I am not
debating that Path and P-Service-Route are dependent on each other.
They are not; but since Path and P-Service-Route *appear* to be doing
similar things for requests, i.e. *force* them to follow a certain path,
there is some equivalence that needs to be strongly pointed out.

 > How can I make this more clear?

Maybe something as simple as the following will do:
"The Path mechanism is applicable for requests arriving at a UA from the
home domain, and the P-Service-Route mechanism is applicable for forcing
requests from the UA to visit the home domain"

Well, it hardly seems right to make a full header dependent on a
P-header, and the full header is more debatable so I did not wish to
make them sequence the other way either. In general, normative
dependencies, especially on works not yet complete, are better when
avoided.

How about:

In Path:

"The routing established by the Path header mechanism applies only to to
requests transiting or originating in the home domain."

In P-Service-Route:

"The routing established by P-Service-Route applies only to requests
originating in the UA and transiting or terminating in the home domain."

The SIP WG has been asked to provide expert review on the individual
informational track draft-garcisip-associated-URI.

This draft provides a lightweight mechanism proposed by 3GPP by which
registrars may inform registering UAs of additional identities (not
listed in the To: header) that the registrar will assoicate with the
registered contact.

We would like to conclude review of this by March 10. 

The current version of the draft has been sent to internet-drafts and is
also available at:

Dean,

Just nits:

- The first line of Path in Table 3 should have a "o" under REG.

- Perhaps you want to add the to the note in 4.7 that for simplication, all
headers added by nodes between UA2 and the REGISTRAR are omitted from the
messages.

Ya-Ching

Hi,

Is it possible that a retransmission of a (non invite)request goes over =
tcp, when the original request was sent over udp?

Thanks

	Title		: Private SIP extension for Associated URI
	Author(s)	: M. Garcia
	Filename	: draft-garcia-sip-associated-uri-00.txt
	Pages		: 4
	Date		: 29-Apr-02
	
This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of a
P-Associated-URI header. A UAC registers a URI to a registrar. Then
the registrar informs the UAC of the associated URIs to its registered
URI. This information is conveyed in the P-Associated-URI header,
carried in a 200 OK response to a REGISTER request.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-garcia-sip-associated-uri-00.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-garcia-sip-associated-uri-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-garcia-sip-associated-uri-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

	Title		: Private SIP extension for Called Party Identity
	Author(s)	: M. Garcia

	Pages		: 6
	Date		: 29-Apr-02
	
This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of a
P-Called-Party-ID header. The home serving proxy inserts this header
typically in an INVITE, en-route to its destination. The header is
populated with the URI received by the proxy in the request. The UAS
identifies which ID out of several IDs the invitation was sent to (for
example, the user may be using simultaneously a personal and a
business SIP URI to receive invitation to sessions). The UAS may use
the information to render different distinctive audiovisual alerting
tones, depending on the ID used to receive the invitation to the
session.

This document registers the message/sipfrag MIME media type.  This
type is similar to message/sip , but allows fragments of well formed
SIP messages to be used for the same tunelling purposes as message/
sip.  In addition to end-to-end security uses , message/sipfrag is
used with the REFER method  to tunnel information about the status of
a referrenced request.

This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of a
P-Visited-Network-ID header. The contents of the header identify each
of the visited networks the message traversed en-route to the home
network.

	Title		: Registration Event package
	Author(s)	: G. Mayer, M. Beckmann
	Filename	: draft-beckmann-sip-reg-event-00.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 29-Apr-02
	
This draft defines an event package that allows a network entity to
request to be notified of changes in the registration state of a
particular user.  Subscription and notification of registration state
is supported by defining an event package within the general  SIP
event notification event framework.  This event package is based on
the Presence event package as specified in [3] and therefore this
draft only describes the deltas to the Presence event package.

Hi,

SIP is a application layer protocol, I would like to know the 
complete protocol stack for SIP.

Actually if I want to design a router which can suppoert SIP what 
would be the minimun set of protocols that the router should 
support and at which layer?

Any help or idea would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Ruhiya

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The SIP Replaces Header
	Author(s)	: B. Biggs, R. Dean, R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-replaces-01.txt
	Pages		: 25
	Date		: 29-Apr-02
	
This document proposes a new header for use with the SIP call control
architecture.  The Replaces header is used in peer-to-peer call
control to logically replace an existing SIP dialog with a new SIP
dialog.  This primitive can be used to enable a variety of features,
for example: 'Attended Transfer' and 'Retrieve from Call Park'.  Note
that definition of these example features is non-normative.

ruhiya,
this is not the correct forum to ask questions about how sip is to 
be implemented. there is a separate list for that on the sip home 
page.
sip is an application layer protocol. as long as your router is 
able to handle regulare tcp/ip communications, there is no need to 
do anything in particular. although we would love it if your 
router secretly gave priority to traffic that involves ports 5004, 
5060, 5005. but i am just being silly.
if you need more information on implementational aspects please 
post it to the implementor's list or you can email me.

I have a question related to SDP information in SIP-T. Is the following
SDP format allowed in SIP-T? If not is there an alternate method to
achieve the same? The application is negotiation of SDP by media
gateways supporting Megaco  and SIP-T is used between two MGCs to
transport the SDP information.


v=0
c=IN IPV ipddress
m=media virtualConnId RTP/AVP 0
v=0
c=ATM NSAP atm_address
 m=media virtualConnId AAL1/ATMF 0

Thanks
Suri

There seems to be insufficient guidance in bis-09 on usage of Call-ID
in REGISTERs. The only thing which I found there is in 10.2.4:

  "A UA SHOULD use the same Call-ID for all registrations during a
   single boot cycle. "

I think that does NOT require Call-ID to change across reboots. UAs
with no memory are not explicitely mandated to change Call-ID (ignoring
that bis asks to deny REGISTERs with Call-ID== and CSeq <= values in registrar's
bindings). If the UACs actually do not change Call-ID, REGISTERs after reboots 
with low CSeq will be ignored.

Which actually happened during two tests in SIPIt.

Also the SHOULD strengh seems to weak -- 'SHOULD' MUST be used if
not doing so does not break things, which is not the case here.

--

Other confusing thing is which SIP reply a request failure for out-of-order REGISTERs 
in line 1740 implies. I could connect it to the next paragraph "....if binding 
update fails...the request MUST fail with 500..." but I am not sure that 500 is 
a good choice.

--

Yet anothet thing, which Jan pointed out, is that handling of out-or-order
in lines 1738-40 also includes retransmissions (CSeq and CallID in request and
bindings equal). Sending some negative reply upstream would in that case 
cause the upstream UAC to consider registration failed.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Extension for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts
	Author(s)	: D. Willis
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-path-04.txt
	Pages		: 15
	Date		: 29-Apr-02
	
The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate
a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact
is generally in the form of a URI, such as Contact:
<sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated
with the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.  The problem is that
network topology may be that there are one or more SIP proxies
between the UA and the registrar, such that any message from the
user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.
The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and
record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.

SIP only allows one session description.  (SIP-T is SIP with interworking
rules and encapsulation.)  Thus what you would have to put in your SDP is

v=0
m=media port RTP/AVP 0
c=IN IPV ipddress
m=media virtualConnId AAL1/ATMF 0
c=ATM NSAP atm_address

In other words, the c= lines now become media-level rather than
session-level in scope, and the two transports are presented as simultaneous
streams from which either the far end chooses one (setting
port/virtualConnId to 0 to reject the other) or supports both.  If the
latter happens, the originator has to send an UPDATE to indicate which
alternative it prefers, again by setting port/virtualConnId to 0 to reject
the other.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SIP Extension for Registering Non-Adjacent Contacts
	Author(s)	: D. Willis
	Filename	: draft-willis-sip-path-04.txt
	Pages		: 15
	Date		: 29-Apr-02
	
The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate
a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact
is generally in the form of a URI, such as Contact:
<sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated
with the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.  The problem is that
network topology may be that there are one or more SIP proxies
between the UA and the registrar, such that any message from the
user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.
The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and
record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-04.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-willis-sip-path-04.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-willis-sip-path-04.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi,

John Loughney has just submitted a first draft rewrite of the SIP AAA
requirements.  Until it appears in the archive, you can download it from:

http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sua/draft-loughney-sip-aaa-req-00.txt

Comments are solicited on the SIPPING list only.

John will also be leading discussion on this topic at the interim meeting

Ok, make that due date May 10, not April 10. That's 2002 . . .

I hate it when I make a wrong turn in the time machine and end up in the
middle of last month.

Hi,

Below is updated agenda information for the interim:  (Note that I
rearranged several of the slots within each day.)

SIP/SIPPING Interim Meeting
May 6-7, 2002
Room S225  (2nd Floor of South Hall)
Las Vegas Convention Center
3150 Paradise Road at Convention Center Drive
Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

The meeting space and network connectivity is being sponsored by
pulver.com's SIP Summit (pulver is part of Key3Media who also runs
Interop).  If you get lost, just ask where SIP summit is.
You do not need to register, but if you have not already done so, please
let me know if you are coming so I can get a reasonable estimate of
attendance.  If you want a shirt, please bring some cash.

Also please note that unfortunately the wireless network won't be up until
Monday afternoon.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,
SIP is an application layer protocol and origins as a large scale multiparty 
conferencing protocol.
MPLS is an advanced forwarding scheme.

Is it possible to join the SIP and MPLS? If it is, we can get
following benefits:
1. using SIP to set up the LSP.
2. providing the higher quality in the Internet.

IF you have any comments about that, Please let me know.

Thank you for your attention

Best regards

Chen

I believe Jon Crowcroft and Mark Gibson suggested something like this at
IETF 46 and barely escaped afterwards. So it's definitely a possibility.
However, it didn't appear at the time that there was much interest in
pursuing it at the IETF.

The slides from their presentation should be at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf46/slides/pres-gibson-sip-qos-r
esv-sip-46.PDF

And the related draft is probably still in the draft "morgue" on that
site.

At the moment, the IETF is treating MPLS as a half-baked cat let out of
the bag, and is trying to put it back in the bag, without success.
Asking to do something involving SIP and MPLS in the same breath is
likely to bring the "layer violation" police out in force.

However:

IF you could bring MPLS to an endpoint
AND you wanted to make the media go directly over an MPLS lsp
OR you used a media relay which, say, took in IP/UDP/RTP and
	pushed that into an LSP

THEN
You could consider putting together an SDP extension along the lines
of the ATM extension, and then you could specify how to create
an lsp to handle the media flow.  No changes to SIP would be required.
I doubt there is any benefit to doing anything with the signalling.

The label stacking mechanism of MPLS could conceivably be put to good
use in aggregating media flows that needed similar QoS handling.

While I think this is an interesting line of inquiry, I suspect:
	a) MPLS networks, today, don't offer any advantage vis a vis
		SIP/multimedia streams that IP networks don't already have
	b) You aren't going to see MPLS to the desktop for a LONG time

I do still wonder if a site-edge relay that mapped streams to lsps,
wouldn't be an interesting architecture.

Hi,

In section 7.1, line 787 states that:
[SIP elements MAY support Request-URIs with schemes other than "sip" and
"sips", for example the
"tel" URI scheme of RFC 2806]

But in section 8.1.12,  line 997 state that:
[All SIP implementations MUST support the SIP and URI scheme]

I think URI is just an error typing and it should be SIPS in line 997, cause
you have MAY in section 7.1 but MUST in section 8.1.12.

Thanks.

I believe this is a horrible idea, and as mentioned by Dean has been
discussed and firmly rejected before. The reason it is so detestful
IMHO, is the Internet goes over many 'nets' withouth making any
assumption about any specific layer 2 end-to-end. That what "Inter" is
all about. It's IP end-to-end, not anything else.
(Some may suspect that MPLS here is just a mutant of ATM...)

MPLS may have have certainly its good use, but this is not one of them
IMHO.

The assumption:
>> providing the higher quality in the Internet
...is also wrong with regard to the Internet. Just make a SIP phone call
using two SIP devices end-to-end and you will see QoS is just fine as
is, especially with the present bandwidth glut. Access QoS is a
different story, but MPLS does not apply there either.

There are the DiffSev and IntServ Internet standards and MPLS is one of
the L2 that can be used with them, but RTP packets will see just IP.

Thats the question. I think you'd generally need to query the user,
although its not unreasonable for a user to configure their UA to
automatically retry in this case.

100rel is about reliability of provisional responses, which is not in
bis at all (anymore)... I think the reference is right as it stands.

Hmm, thats a good point. I think this paragraph can stay as it is, but
instead, section 5.2.1 should say that, if supported, the uas SHOULD
request an update instead of generating the repairable error response.

[5] is sip-events, I don't get it?

This really isn't different than any other extension. I'll note the
issue though.

No, that seems to be the right thing. Changed.

Now that the draft has been split into two (UPDATE and 155), Reason is
part of the 155 stuff. It wasn't there initially for process reasons,
which are now moot.

THe 1xx need not have been sent reliably; 100rel requires it, but
baseline bis doesn't (although the words are kind of vague in the spec).

Its just transition text; I'll clean up.

UPDATE has the semantics of the request which created the dialog on
which its sent. However, I must admit that this makes me kind of
queasy... This bit about INVITE vs. SUBSCRIBE is only an issue for the
herfp usage, now in a separate draft. We have the opportunity now to
consider whether that is the actual semantic we want.

This is an odd exception, due to the fact that 155 isn't *really* the
response. Really, the response is an error response, and the SDP is the
capabilities of the UAS, as would be present in a 488.

We had a whole thread on this. The conclusion was that the UAS needs to
be prohibited from sending an UPDATE with an offer if it has sent SDP in
a 1xx for which it hasn't gotten a PRACK yet. We can't disallow offers
in PRACK, since it is too late for that. The reason for it was pressure,
as I recall, from manyfolks, to allow for the baseline manyfolks
exchange without an extra transaction (remember the 3gpp guys want to
keep the transaction count down).

No, this paragraph is avoiding infinite 155 loops. You are talking about
a different proble, which I don't think is discussed, and needs to be. I
suppose it is OK to generate another 155 in this case.

Hmm. Its not strictly needed, but since its a target refresh request, it
probably has to be there....

For the subscribe usage, yes, but since update and herfp are split, the
baseline update won't need it, so its a -.

yup.

Right. Sadly, I copied this table from an older version of bis, before
we have a major overhaul, and it got out of sync. I re-aligned.

Right.

Yes, you 487. No different than any other mid-dialog request outside of
an active 
dialog.

Thanks for your comments.

Folks,

I just submitted an update to UPDATE, based on comments from the list.
Until it appaers in the archives, you can find it at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-update-02.txt

The changes:

* excised 155, herfp, reason stuff
* table 1/2 aligned with bis
* fixed text to indicate that you can't send an UPDATE until you've
received the PRACK for a 1xx you sent that contained SDP.
* more rigorous processing defined

Thanks,
Jonathan R.
