Yes, I imagine the same, devices ignoring Event parameters would show all =

their dialogs. So, even if the proxy just forward SUBSCRIBE if Event header =

contains call-id and to-tag parameters, it will imply a privacy risk for th=
e =

device which doesn't implement correctly RFC 4235.

I promise I'll read it entirely, but in a fast read I don't find what you =

could suggest, just considerations about dialog forming.
Could you please point to me what exactly you mean? Perhaps that INFO =

shouldn't be used as an initial request?

Thanks a lot.

The original draft for INFO (like most from that time) were pretty =

loosely worded. That is part of the trouble. So its been necessary to =

interpret intent.

It seems clear that the original definition was intended to convey =

information that was closely tied to the session. Without a session that =

doesn't make sense.

The current effort to clarify this (the info package work submitted by =

Eric Burger, and subject to vigorous debate recently) will certainly =

nail it down further. That is proposing to *negotiate* the packages to =

be delivered, and the negotiation takes place within the invite dialog =

usage. (Much like offer/answer.) This ties INFO more closely to the session.

If you have an application for INFO outside of the invite dialog usage, =

then you could submit a draft proposing that. I wouldn't recommend doing =

so. It wouldn't be well received.

	Thanks,
	Paul

if SUBSCRIBE is not used for this, then OPTIONS might be a possibility.

Thanks for clarification.

In this case, any other request method could be used (OPTIONS, MESSAGE...).

Isal,

here are some answers to your questions:

Steps (12) to (19) are necessary if a policy contains elements that need 
to be shared among policy servers. For example, if both policy servers 
insert media intermediaries, then each intermediary needs to know the 
address of the other intermediary so that media streams can be exchanged 
between them. This is discussed in section 4.5.2.

After two rounds of subscriptions, all policy servers were able to i) 
submit their policies and ii) receive infos from other policy servers 
(if needed). There is no need for more rounds.

Good catch! InfoOffer and PolicyOffer is indeed missing in (9) and (10) 
in figure 3 and (12) and (13) in figure 4. The figures in the appendix 
had the correct flows.

I'll submit an updated version that fixes the bugs.

Thanks,

Volker

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies
	Author(s)       : V. Hilt, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-05.txt
	Pages           : 35
	Date            : 2008-11-01

Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call
routing, rendezvous, and other call features.  This document
specifies a framework for SIP session policies that provides a
standard mechanism by which a proxy can define or influence policies
on sessions, such as the codecs or media types to be used.  It
defines a model, an overall architecture and new protocol mechanisms
for session policies.

Yeah.

And factoring in retransmission requests . . .

Alice is the target of the attack.

Evil Dave forges an INVITE with DERIVE-supported from Alice to Bob.

Bob then sends a SUBSCRIBE to Alice. Alice either 404s, or (if she  =

doesn't support  4235) does something like ignore the request. Bob  =

then retransmits through the NIT-retransmission cycle, thereby  =

generating a factor-N attack multiplication with indirection.

Now, if Dave really hates Alice, Dave sends the same sort of forged  =

INVITE to Carol and Eugene and Frank and everbody else.

Alice is the one being attacked, but she can't trace the source of the  =

attack back to Dave's I P address without cooperation from Bob and the  =

other relayers.

Is this any worse than the multiplier already built into SIP? It's  =

probably not any worse than the "voice hammer" attack, although it's  =

different in that it floods the signaling channel, not the media  =

channel. So really, it's Alice's proxy that is the target of such an  =

attack.

Ooh, that's a big can of worms to open.

It strikes me that DERIVE is in many ways similar to the non-deployed  =

SIP Consent Framework. Think about it.

I would argue that when Steve, Matt and I invented it on the  
whiteboard at MCI, we were thinking about using INFO for out-of-dialog  
instant messages. We were also thinking of using it in-dialog for  
presence updates (using an INVITE-formed dialog).

But it mutated after it hit paper and the MMUSIC working group's  
review cycle.

The early stimulus for this work came from discussions at the joint
IETF/3GPP workshop 
held in San Francisco in January 2003, where it was desired to find a
mechanism for the 
network to provide policy without the network modifying the SDP of an
offer/answer 
exchange in order to do so.

The work has developed from requirements specified in:
draft-ietf-sipping-session-
policy-req-02.

WGLC was initiated in the SIP WG on draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-01 on
21st May 2007 
with comments requested by 11th June 2007.

Review was made and comments were received from: SIPPING appointed
special reviewers 
Alan Johnston, Bob Benfield, Roni Even and Flemming Andreasen for the
set of documents 
in this package. During the course of the work comments have also been
made by:  Roni 
Even, Bob Penfield, Mary Barnes, Shida Schubert, Andrew Allen, Yuxia
Zhang.

The document was moved from the SIPPING WG to the SIP WG in conformance
with RFC 3427 
because it defines new header fields and an option tag. Prior review and
discussion 
therefore took place in the SIPPING group.

The document is closely related with:

-	draft-ietf-sipping-policy-package-05;
-	draft-ietf-sipping-media-policy-dataset-06.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization, or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no external review
from an external 
specialist is necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this document
          been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the
          disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on
          this issue.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose in a form 
that has been used for many other extensions. The document shepherd has
no concerns with 
the document.

There have been no IPR disclosures on this document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

While the document has been reviewed by appropriate SIP experts, the
level of readership 
of the SIP working group has apparently been moderate. This may lead one
to assume that 
the contents for this solution are correct, but potentially there could
have been other 
solutions out there that have been missed.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.)  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?  If the document
          does not already indicate its intended status at the top of
          the first page, please indicate the intended status here.

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is believed 
that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, and two new SIP header
fields, these 
have been performed as a SIP working group item, and therefore this
draft is in 
conformance with RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS the checks against idnits 2.09.01 report no NITS found.

Summary: 0 errors (**), 3 warnings (==), 1 comment (--).

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has separate sections for normative and informative
references. The 
normative references have been checked and found to be normative.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document's IANA
          Considerations section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggest a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the
          document describes an Expert Review process, has the Document
          Shepherd conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that
          the IESG can appoint the needed Expert during IESG Evaluation?

The document defines the following values that require registration:

-	a new SIP header field Policy-Id
-	a new SIP header field Policy-Contact
-	a new option tag policy
-	a new Policy-Contact header field parameter non-cacheable

Section 6 of the document provides the IANA considerations section, and
this defines the 
above.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document defines two items in ABNF, the Policy-Id header field and
the Policy-
Contact header field. These augment the ABNF defined in RFC 3261.

Both these items pass Bill Fenner's ABNF parser in the tools webpage.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

          Technical Summary
             Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract
             and/or introduction of the document.  If not, this may be
             an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract
             or introduction.

          Working Group Summary
             Was there anything in the WG process that is worth noting?
             For example, was there controversy about particular points
             or were there decisions where the consensus was
             particularly rough?

          Document Quality
             Are there existing implementations of the protocol?  Have a
             significant number of vendors indicated their plan to
             implement the specification?  Are there any reviewers that
             merit special mention as having done a thorough review,
             e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a
             conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?  If
             there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type, or other Expert Review,
             what was its course (briefly)?  In the case of a Media Type
             Review, on what date was the request posted?

          Personnel
             Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Who is the
             Responsible Area Director?  If the document requires IANA
             experts(s), insert 'The IANA Expert(s) for the registries
             in this document are <TO BE ADDED BY THE AD>.'

Technical summary.

Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
Initiation Protocol 
(SIP) as they define and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous,
and other call 
features.  This document specifies a framework for SIP session policies
that provides a 
standard mechanism by which a proxy can define or influence policies on
sessions, such 
as the codecs or media types to be used.  It defines a model, an overall
architecture 
and new protocol mechanisms for session policies.

Working group summary.

There is consensus in the working group to publish this document. The
early stimulus for 
this work came from discussions at the joint IETF/3GPP workshop held in
San Francisco in 
January 2003.

Document Quality

There has been no indication of implementation.

Personnel

The document shepherd for this document was Keith Drage. The responsible
Area Director 
was Cullen Jennings. 'The IANA Expert(s) for the registries in this
document are <TO BE 
ADDED BY THE AD>.

The Accept: header field describes the MIME types the UA is willing to  
accept.

RFC 3261 says that if there is no Accept header, then the default is  
application/sdp.

What do we want to do with INFO?

In what follows, I use the terms UAS and UAC with respect to the INFO  
request. That is, the UAC sends the INFO and the UAS receives it.


Do we require a UAS to enumerate every MIME type associated with the  
Info Packages advertised in the UAS' Recv-Info header? I see two  
schools of thought on this one:

1. Follow full RFC 3261: the UAS MUST enumerate every MIME type  
associated with the Info Packages advertised in the UAS' Recv-Info  
header the UA is willing to receive. If a UAC sends a body that  
includes something not enumerated by the UAS, this is a protocol error  
and the UAS should barf appropriately.

2. Follow the text as is, where the specification of an Info Package  
in Recv_Info (and the corresponding advertisement in Send_Info)  
includes an implicit set of MIME types associated with the said package.


Pros of #1:
a. Cannot be wrong following RFC 3261
b. Provides a protocol mechanism for negotiating MIME types
c. Lets a UAC know whether the UAS can process a particular MIME type  
the UAC wishes to send (refinement of (b) above). For example, if the  
package sends images, it would be helpful for the UAC to know it can  
send image/jpeg but it cannot send image/png

Cons of #1:
a. The Accept header can grow to be very, very, very, very, very long.
b. There is no way to associate the MIME type in the Accept header  
with a particular package. That is, the UAC may advertise image/jpeg  
and image/png. The UAS may accept image/png for icons but image/jpeg  
for applications. There is no way to communicate this to the UAC.

Pros of #2:
a. Accept header does not grow without bound
b. No worse from a protocol perspective than Con #1(b).

Cons of #2:
a. Does not strictly follow RFC 3261


So, YAV:
Do we mandate UAS' enumerate the MIME types associated with a given  
package in its capability exchange with the UAC?

[ ] Yes - RFC 3261 is RFC 3261. Not to the Left, not to the Right.

[ ] No - the MIME type enumeration really does not help, so long as  
the MIME types associated with a package are enumerated in a registry  
somewhere

[ ] Maybe - we need to solve the association of the MIME type to the  
package first, then we can do RFC 3261. (This is a solvable problem;  
the question is whether anyone cares and if it is really important in  
the real world.)

Such questions always force me to go review the base documents again in 
a different light.

Things I discovered:

- 3261 says the semantics are the same as RFC 2616, except the default 
is application/sdp instead of */*.

- 2616 says that the Accept specifies what is acceptable *in the 
response*! It doesn't say anything about what is acceptable in future 
requests.

However SIP seemingly has a history of assuming this applies to bodies 
sent in future requests as well. (But the scope of that promise is not 
well understood.)

Its also my understanding that, as used in SIP, Accept is rarely 
absolute, except perhaps in 415 responses. Other places, it says "I can 
accept this" but *doesn't* say "I can't accept anything else".

So I think you are free to try sending a body of a type that wasn't 
mentioned in Accept, but might get a 415. If so, and the Accept in the 
415 doesn't include that type then you had better refrain from using it 
again. (At least in a similar context, for awhile.)

We are trying to make this simpler, not harder.
I think it would be fine to just ignore Accept, and start out assuming 
that any type that is allowed by a package is accepted. If the sender 
gets a 415 in response to an INFO, and the Accept in the 415 doesn't 
contain the C-T used in the INFO, then it shouldn't try that C-T in that 
package type again for awhile. (3pcc can cause circumstances to change.)

This narrows the scope of Accept, down to a per-package basis. In spite 
of C-T X having been rejected in package type A, it might still be 
accepted in package type B. So I think this all needs to be spelled out 
in the document.

	Thanks for asking the hard questions,
	Paul

Further said, Accept is insane as a negotiation mechanism.

I personally don't think that the matter of a B2BUA is a showstopping
one -- a B2BUA, which is a largely underspecified element, can  be still
built in a way that DERIVE will work. (by not mangling callid, by 
responding
on UAS's behalf....)

I think it would be reasonable to mention when DERIVE fails though ....

FYI, at Victor Pascual =C1vila's request (thank you, Victor), I updated =20=

my I-D about the need for a common visual identifier for trusted =20
identity to reflect the feedback I had received after the initial =20
posting back in July.  The document is now available at:

=
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-york-sip-visual-identifier-trust=
ed-identity-01.txt

and comments are certainly welcome.

However, I'd note that John Elwell has included many of the issues I =20
raised into his much more comprehensive draft at:

=
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-sip-identity-handling-ua-=
00.txt

particularly in sections 2.7 and 2.8.  Given that, the value in my =20
narrower draft is questionable to me and so I may not be updating it =20
further.   (Once today's submission deadline is passed, I will be =20
reviewing John's document and sending him comments.)

Regards,
Dan

In fact, if we were not to reuse dialog package, I would prefer a separate
method rather than overloading an existing one. The beauty of the dialog
package is it comes for free, the downside is it is indeed limited to
the dialogs. The problem to me is both appear appealing in their own way :)

   So, if nobody objects, I suggest we specify the following:

I agree with everything in this message, except that I think the
followig three statements should be removed:

   o the handling of a multipart/mixed is 'required' if its processing as a
   whole is required.

   o the handling of a multipart/alternative is 'required' if its
   processing as a whole is required.

   o the handling of a multipart/related is 'required' if its processing as
      a whole is required.

These statements are not quite correct when multiparts are nested
(I'll explain below), and the correct interpretation comes from
applying the stated rules to the multipart's parent part.  These
statements could be corrected by changing "if its processing as a
whole is required" to "if its processing as a whole is required for
processing the enclosing body part or message".

An example is:

	multipart/mixed;handling=required

	    multipart/mixed;handling=optional

	        multipart/mixed;handling=required

	            text/xml

In this case, the processing of the 3rd multipart is required in order
to process the 2nd multipart, but since the 2nd multipart is optional,
there is no assurrance the 3rd multipart will be processed.

Yes, you read that right, this is a *Fax* Interoperability Workshop.


Location:
The W San Francisco Hotel -- (across the street from the Moscone =20
Convention Center and the VoiceCon show)
Workroom #2, 3rd Floor.
181 Third Street, San Francisco CA 94103

Date & Time: Monday, November 10, 2008 -- 11:00am - 3:00pm
Cost: FREE
Organizer: SIP Forum
Lead Sponsor: Dialogic


BACKGROUND
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The demand for fax and fax services remains high. Fax Over IP (FoIP) =20
is gaining momentum in the industry, but a number of issues remain =20
that seriously impact interoperability and reliability.

Issue: G.711 Fax Reliability:

The ITU-T T.38 FoIP protocol standard overcame many of the issues =20
experienced when transmitting a fax over G.711. However, many Service =20=

Providers use VoIP Gateways that do not support T.38. These Carriers =20
pass fax traffic through their network using G.711. Fax traffic is =20
highly sensitive to packet loss. The loss of fax packets (from latency =20=

or jitter for example) results in faxes to fail and be re-transmitted =20=

which uses more bandwidth and lowers the end user=92s satisfaction. Many =
=20
carriers desire a FoIP solution that allows them to utilize their non-=20=

T.38 infrastructure to reliably carry fax traffic.

Issue: T.38 Fax Interoperability:

Many enterprises use T.38 for fax transmission. However, variations in =20=

the interpretation of the T.38 specification have lead to various =20
interoperability challenges between vendors. There is speculation that =20=

improvements or profiles during session setup can alleviate many of =20
these problems.


WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The SIP Forum FoIP Interoperability Workshop will bring together =20
researchers, engineers, and service providers to exchange ideas, share =20=

experiences, and propose approaches to address FoIP problems.  =20
Particular focus will be on the use and applicability of SIP to =20
address systemic or architectural problems. We will not be examining =20
implementation errors.  If the workshop identifies concrete proposals =20=

to improve FoIP that would require modifications to the underlying =20
protocols, we will forward these proposals to the appropriate groups =20
in the IETF, IEEE, or ITU-T.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

     * Interoperability failures seen in the field or lab
     * Reliability or quality issues seen in the field or lab
     * Deployment experiences
     * Development experiences
     * Architectural principals
     * Proposals for achieving a higher degree of FoIP =20
interoperability and/or FoIP reliability
     * Proposals for soliciting additional real-world feedback from =20
implementers and service providers




DISCUSSION MATERIALS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The purpose of having position papers for this workshop is purely to =20
help focus discussion and allow participants to get a feel for what =20
other participants are thinking about. This is not a scholarly =20
conference. PowerPoint presentations are fine! The goal of the =20
workshop is not to publish high-quality research papers. The goal of =20
the workshop is to publish a workshop report discussing the technical =20=

issues that are of the utmost importance to the industry, as well as a =20=

roadmap for how to address them.

We encourage Individuals to submit position papers relevant to FoIP. =20
Acceptable formats are IETF Internet Draft style (in HTML or plain =20
text), IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscripts style (in PDF), =20
ACM Transactions style (in PDF), or presentation style (in PDF). The =20
papers should be no longer than 6 pages if in IEEE or ACM style or 10 =20=

pages of text in Internet Draft style. There is no minimum length =20
requirement. You may submit relevant, previously published works. If =20
there is a copyright issue with the SIP Forum posting previously =20
published papers, please give us a reference to the paper so we can =20
direct participants to the appropriate publisher.

Papers received by the submission deadline will be posted to the =20
Workshop web site, unless the author(s) request withholding =20
publication. The author(s) may retain copyright or assign it to the =20
SIP Forum. If you are submitting a paper that already has a copyright =20=

assignment, such as an IEEE or ACM conference or journal paper, please =20=

apply the appropriate self-publication disclaimers demanded by those =20
organizations.

Submit your position paper using EasyChair at the following address:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsffiw1


WORKSHOP FORMAT
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The expectation is this will be a highly interactive workshop. In =20
order to frame the conversation, the workshop chair will open the =20
discussion. At the discretion of the workshop chair and dependent upon =20=

the quality and number of position papers received, the workshop chair =20=

may request formal presentations. Note that all position papers will =20
be published on the SIP Forum web site, unless the author(s) request =20
withholding publication.




WORKSHOP FEES
The workshop, including lunch, is free of charge to active participants.

Hi Cullen,

well, apart from the Q&A bellow, would not it make sense to ask =

ourselves first:
is there a problem to be solved?

my 2 cents are: yes, absence of a simple way of checking "is it you who =

is calling
me" is a problem.

Simple means to me application(sip)-based, end-to-end, without
communicating to other infrastructure.

I'm just wondering if you, as well as other WG participants have an =

opinion on this
very basic question.

I suppose those who were recently getting the 3AM unsolicited calls =

would agree
with me, even without knowing what SIP is. In fact, attackers seem to be =

less
concerned about all the intriguing solution aspects being debated right now.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : C. Jennings, J. Fischl
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-certs-07.txt
	Pages           : 31
	Date            : 2008-11-03

This draft defines a Credential Service that allows Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP event
package to discover the certificates of other users.  This mechanism
allows user agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record
(AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the
Credential Service, which returns an authenticated response
containing that certificate.  The Credential Service also allows
users to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP at:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : J. Rosenberg
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-06.txt

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous
specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be
difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set
of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification serves
as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the
specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and
groups them into categories.

Feedback on the new version. It has addressed most of the problems I had 
with the last one, but introduced some new ones. (But the net progress 
is quite positive.)

I suppose I should split this up into multiple topics. But I want to go 
home.

--------------

Why the introduction of the 'nil' info package?
What was wrong with no token?

--------------

In section 4.1:

    The UAC MUST include the Info-Package header field when it sends an
    INFO request carrying an Info Package.  The Info-Package header field
    value in an INFO request contains a single Info Package token.  If
    the UAC is sending multiple Info Packages in the INFO request, the
    UAC MUST include the appropriate Info-Package headers, one header per
    package, as described below.

So far so good.

                                  If the UAS indicated support for the
    INFO method and Info Packages as described in this document by the
    presence of a Recv-Info header field during negotiation, the token in
    the Info-Package header field value MUST match one of the Info
    Package tokens received in the Recv-Info header field value in the
    received INVITE or dialog modification transaction for the UAS in
    response to the UAC.

The above doesn't quite say all that you mean. It doesn't say that if 
the UAS *did not* indicate support for Info Packages then the UAC MUST 
NOT include an Info-Package header.

                          In other words, one can only send what the
    other end is willing to receive.

The "in other words" recaps a normative statement that isn't made.

                                      The SOLE exception to this rule is
    if the UAC wishes to send an INFO in a legacy usage context.  In this
    case, if the UAS has never offered a Recv-Info header or never
    offered a Recv-Info header with a package of a similar function to
    the legacy INFO usage, the UAC MAY send an INFO without an Info-
    Package header field and a body appropriate to the said legacy usage.

After the other stuff is cleared up, I don't think the above is an 
*exception*, since that stuff has to do with Info-Packages. This is 
really in-addition-to all that other stuff.

The following is an attempt to fix all that:

    The UAC MUST include the Info-Package header field when it sends an
    INFO request carrying an Info Package.  The Info-Package header field
    value in an INFO request contains a single Info Package token.  If
    the UAC is sending multiple Info Packages in the INFO request, the
    UAC MUST include the appropriate Info-Package headers, one header per
    package, as described below. The token in each Info-Package header
    field MUST match one of the Info
    Package tokens received in the Recv-Info header field value in the
    received INVITE or dialog modification transaction for the UAS in
    response to the UAC.  In other words, one can only send what the
    other end is willing to receive.

    The UAC MAY send an INFO in a legacy usage context, that is,
    an INFO without an Info-Package header field, if and only if
    it has never offered a Recv-Info header field naming a package
    of equivalent function within the current dialog. The function
    of the legacy usage context is determined by the Content-Type of
    the INFO message body.

--------------

I'm troubled by the following:

    If the UAS receives an INFO request with a Info-Package the UAC
    advertised with a Send-Info in the last dialog state update and the
    UAS advertised with a Recv-Info and the body of the INFO request is
    an appropriate MIME type for the Info Package, the UAS MUST send a
    200 OK response.

This means that the UAS must support *all* the mime types associated 
with an info package type. That may not be a reasonable assumption for 
all package types. Even if we grant that it should be, another 
versioning issue appears: Version 1 of a package definition specifies 
only mime type X. Version 2 of the package specifies mime types X and Y. 
A UAS that only supports version 1 will have trouble with a version 2 UAC.

I think it would be better to simply permit the UAS to return a 415 error.

--------------

IMO the following isn't quite strong enough:

    The UAS MUST send a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist message
    if the INFO request does not match any existing dialog.

Its also a problem if there is such a dialog, but no 
invite-dialog-usage. How about:

    The UAS MUST send a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist message
    if the INFO request does not match any existing dialog, or if it
    matches an existing dialog that has no INVITE dialog usage.

--------------

In the following:

    For the purposes of matching Info Package types indicated in Send-
    Info or Recv-Info with those in the Info-Package header field value,
    one compares the Info-package-name portion of the Info-package-type
    portion of the "Info-Package" header byte-by-byte with that of the
    same in the "Send-Info" or "Recv-Info" header values.

Is it intended that the comparison be case-sensitive? That is the way it 
reads. But elsewhere the Info-package-type is referred to as a 'token', 
and tokens are case-insensitive. IMO a case-insensitive comparison would 
be more appropriate. Most things in contexts like this are case 
insensitive, so it might be more trouble to parse if its case sensitive 
here.

--------------

    The Info Package MAY allow overlapping (outstanding) INFO requests.
    If the package does not allow overlapping INFO requests, the Info
    Package MUST disclose this in the section describing UA generation of
    INFO requests.

Allowing this on a per-package basis is problematic if multiple info 
packages may be in use within the dialog. If one package doesn't allow 
overlap, then even infos of other types must not be sent so as to 
overlap with it.

--------------

    Each Info Package MUST define a requirement of SHOULD or MUST
    strength which defines an absolute maximum on the rate at which an
    Info Package can generate INFO messages by a UA in a dialog.

Since multiple packages may be in use, and because multiple packages may 
share the same INFO, I think this limit must be the rate at which info 
*packages of this type* are sent.

--------------

    Info-Package        =  "Info-Package" HCOLON Info-package-type
                           [ ";" "cid" "=" token ]

Should be: [ SEMI "cid" "=" token ]

--------------

    Send-Info           =  "Send-Info" HCOLON "nil"
                        /  Info-package-type
                           *( COMMA Info-package-type )
    Recv-Info           =  "Recv-Info" HCOLON "nil"
                        /  Info-package-type
                           *( COMMA Info-package-type )

I'm pretty sure the above doesn't get the precedence right. I think you 
need:

    Send-Info           =  "Send-Info" HCOLON package-list
    Recv-Info           =  "Recv-Info" HCOLON package-list
    package-list        =  nil
                        /  Info-package-type *( COMMInfo-package-type )

Even the above is problematic, because the following is still legal:

    Send-Info: nil
    Send-Info: foo

--------------

Example 10.1 doesn't show body, so doesn't show that cid is needed even 
with a single body.

--------------

That's all for now folks!

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi folks,
=20
sec 7.2 of draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-04
=20
      Also per the previous rules, a 'multipart/mixed' body whose
      handling is required can contain only body parts whose handling is
      optional.
=20
I wonder why required multipart/mixed can NOT contain required body
part?
I think it's just same meaning repeated once, should be fine.
=20
any thoughts?
=20
thanks
-Rockson

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework
	Author(s)	: E. Burger, H. Kaplan, C. Holmberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-info-events-01.txt
	Pages		: 41
	Date		: 2008-11-4
	
This document defines the new INFO method and a mechanism for
   defining, negotiating and exchanging Info Packages that use the INFO
   method.  Applications which need to exchange session-related
   information within a SIP INVITE-created dialog, also known as
   application level information, use these INFO requests.  This draft
   addresses issues and open items from RFC 2976, and replaces it.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-info-events-01.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP at:
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I explored giving such a tutorial but was advised, by our area directors among 
others (in Philly), that such events are extraordinary and are not encouraged. 
Apparently the relatively recent lunchtime ICE tutorial was such an 
extraordinary event.

I remain interested and ready to provide a SAML tutorial if folks can figure 
out where/when/how to do it.

In the meantime, I encourage folks inquisitive/curious wrt SAML to first read 
this very short document..

  How to Study and Learn SAML
  http://identitymeme.org/how-to-study-and-learn-saml/

..and then peruse the references of the above document as-suggested, e.g. this 
technical overview doc..

  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0 Technical Overview 
<http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/28345/sstc-saml-tech-overvie
w-2.0-draft-16.pdf>

Hi all,

We have submitted draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-03.

The result from the last meeting was incorporated
as follows.

- add the text on the necessity of Privacy:id
  to delete a P-Asserted-Identity header

- add the advantages and disadvantages of
  two options for From header

- rewrite the Security Considerations to include
  the concern of the domain name in temp-gruu in
  a Contact header and the use of third party
  anonymization service

- some editorial changes

Now, all the open issues have been solved and
we believe that the draft is ready for WGLC.

Thanks,

Mayumi

To add to the list of documents could I suggest that 

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-04.txt

is absolutely essential for SIP implementations, as it provides
essential requirements for the handling of multipart bodies, something
that the need for is getting even more frequent.

Keith

(As an added incentive its in the 3GPP profile of SIP extensions!)

(As SIP WG chair)

I notice that 

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-info-litmus-02.t
xt

has been recently revised.

My understanding was that if SIP was documenting any of this material it
belonged in draft-ietf-sip-info-events.

Can the author or anyone else clarify:

-	what from this draft is already in info-events?
-	what still should be added to info-events?
-	what do we otherwise need to discuss?

regards

Keith

(As SIP WG chair)

I believe:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-target-uri-deliv
ery-00.txt

is Jonathans input that replaces:

http://tools.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route
-02.txt

and is a draft to be considered for our charter milestone on:

Dec 2008    Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to
WGLC (PS)  
Feb 2009    Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to
IESG (PS)  

Please therefore read and comment on this draft as to its suitability
for meeting this deliverable, and for conformance with the directions we
established in IETF#72.

regards

Keith

The material appended to this note consists of four scenarios.  Each is
(I believe) a race condition not described in
    draft-ietf-sipping-race-examples-06
You will need to view this message in a fixed-width font.

These were discovered by analysis of a formal model of INVITE dialogs,
as posted on
    http://www.research.att.com/~pamela/sip.html

What do you think?

Pamela Zave



SCENARIO 1.  This scenario occurs within a confirmed dialog.

       UAC                                                     UAS

                               re-INVITE 1
         <------------------------------------------------------
                                 no sdp

                             200(re-INVITE 1)
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                                 offer
                                                           ACK 1
                                       -------------------------
                                      /                   answer
                                     /   re-INVITE 2
       ! <--------------------------/---------------------------
                                   /        offer
                                  /
         <------------------------

                             200(re-INVITE 2)
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                                 answer

                                  ACK 2
         <------------------------------------------------------

At the point marked "!", the UAC cannot respond to the re-INVITE
immediately.  It must buffer this request until it receives ACK 1,
which completes the ongoing offer/answer exchange.

SCENARIO 2.

       UAC                                                     UAS

                  ini-INVITE
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                     offer
                                             183(reliable) 1
         <------------------------------------------------------
                                                 answer
                     PRACK 1
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                     no sdp
                                              200(PRACK 1)
         <------------------------------------------------------

                  UPDATE                      183(reliable) 2
         -------------------------     -------------------------
                  offer            \ /            offer
                                    x
                                   / \
       ! <------------------------     ------------------------>

                                491(UPDATE)
         <------------------------------------------------------

                                  PRACK 2
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                                 answer

                                              200(PRACK 2)
         <------------------------------------------------------

At the point marked "!", the UAC cannot respond to the 183 immediately,
although immediate response is required by the standard.  Rather, it  
must
wait until it receives the response to the UPDATE, which will terminate
the ongoing offer/answer exchange.  The UAC CANNOT assume that the  
update
will fail, because it may succeed, as shown in the next scenario.

SCENARIO 3.  This scenario has roughly the same problem as Scenario 2,
although the race condition that causes it is different.

       UAC                                                     UAS

                  ini-INVITE
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                     offer
                                             183(reliable) 1
         <------------------------------------------------------
                                                 answer
                     PRACK 1
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                     no sdp
                                              200(PRACK 1)
         <------------------------------------------------------

                                  UPDATE
         ------------------------------------------------------>
                                  offer

                                              200(UPDATE)
                                       -------------------------
                                      /          answer
                                     /
       ! <--------------------------/---------------------------

                                200(PRACK 2)
         <------------------------------------------------------

SCENARIO 4.

       UAC                                                     UAS

At the point marked "!", the UAC cannot respond to the re-INVITE
immediately.  It must buffer this request until it receives 200(PRACK),
which completes the ongoing offer/answer exchange.

The IESG has approved the following document:

- 'Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies '
   <draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-08.txt> as a Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working 
Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Cullen Jennings and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-08.txt

Technical Summary 

This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
Protocol 
(SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP proxy
behavior. 
This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP networks where a small 
number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate massive
amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic. 

This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies 
when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one
destination). 
It also corrects and clarifies the description of the loop-detection 
algorithm such proxies are required to implement. 

Working Group Summary 

The document was produced by the SIP working group. There is consensus in
the WG to publish this document. 

Document Quality 

The document has been produced as a result of an issue identified during
SIPit interoperability testing.

Pamela,

Are you familiar with:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer-09.txt

The race-examples draft and the offeranswer draft got going 
independently, with different foci, but there is an area of overlap in 
scope. There is a lot in the offeranswer draft that touches on your 
cases. In particular, section 4.1 of that document addresses this sort 
of thing. I'll say more in line.

I do appreciate your coming at this from a formal model perspective. We 
weren't that thorough, and can easily have left holes. We just have to 
get your models to adequately reflect reality. (And unfortunately the 
reality is sometimes not pretty.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

I think this is indeed a new case. The UAC can't distinguish this from 
the case where the re-INVITE 2 was sent even before the prior 200 was 
received. But it is very close to what is described in section 14.2 of 
3261.

My thought is that the UAC should send a 491 response to the re-INVITE 
2. But this case isn't specifically addressed.

The UAC could also try delaying in hope of getting the ACK, but that 
seems more trouble.

This *ought* to be addressed in section 4.1 of offeranswer. I just 
rewrote that section last weekend because nobody could understand it 
before. But sadly it misses this case. Table 4 needs another row or two 
to cover this.

This case is declared to be illegal. The rule (not so clear in the RFCs, 
clarified in offeranswer) is that after the first o/a exchange of an 
INVITE, you cannot initiate another o/a exchange using the 1xx/2xx/PRACK 
for that same INVITE. (If you want another o/a exchange before 
completing the INVITE you must use UPDATE to do it.)

I don't understand this one at all. You are showing another *initial* 
invite, which would (by defintion) be establishing a separate dialog. 
There is then no interference between the two dialogs - they should be 
analyzed separately.

Correction. In my earlier response below I totally misread scenario 4. 
I'm updating my response to it.

Pamela,

Are you familiar with:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer-09.txt

The race-examples draft and the offeranswer draft got going
independently, with different foci, but there is an area of overlap in
scope. There is a lot in the offeranswer draft that touches on your
cases. In particular, section 4.1 of that document addresses this sort
of thing. I'll say more in line.

I do appreciate your coming at this from a formal model perspective. We
weren't that thorough, and can easily have left holes. We just have to
get your models to adequately reflect reality. (And unfortunately the
reality is sometimes not pretty.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

I think this is indeed a new case. The UAC can't distinguish this from
the case where the re-INVITE 2 was sent even before the prior 200 was
received. But it is very close to what is described in section 14.2 of
3261.

My thought is that the UAC should send a 491 response to the re-INVITE
2. But this case isn't specifically addressed.

The UAC could also try delaying in hope of getting the ACK, but that
seems more trouble.

This *ought* to be addressed in section 4.1 of offeranswer. I just
rewrote that section last weekend because nobody could understand it
before. But sadly it misses this case. Table 4 needs another row or two
to cover this.

This case is declared to be illegal. The rule (not so clear in the RFCs,
clarified in offeranswer) is that after the first o/a exchange of an
INVITE, you cannot initiate another o/a exchange using the 1xx/2xx/PRACK
for that same INVITE. (If you want another o/a exchange before
completing the INVITE you must use UPDATE to do it.)

I think the alarm bells go off for the UAC when it receives the 200 for 
the ini-invite. It really shouldn't want to send the ACK yet, because as 
far as it is concerned, it has an unanswered offer outstanding.

So my inclination would be that the UAC should just ignore the 
200(ini-INVITE), sending no ACK. This will force the UAS to retransmit 
it. The UAC doesn't know that the PRACK with answer is enroute, but in 
this case it would then probably arrive before the 200 is retransmitted, 
so things would recover.

But this is an interesting case to call out.

As I noted above, I just rewrote section 4.1 of the offer/answer draft, 
but it is lacking your scenarios 1 & 4. If you have any thoughts on how 
to better treat section 4.1 I would be pleased to hear them.

	Thanks,

I'd like to request several people to review the UA Initiated Privacy  
draft in conjunction with the WGLC that we expect to start shortly.

See: http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-03.txt


Such reviews should look at:

1) Readability -- does the draft, as written, make sense? Are the  
examples clear?

2) Technical correctness: Are the recommendations of the draft valid?  
Are they consistent with our other specifications, and if not, does  
the draft clearly explain these inconsistencies and give a rationale?

Each reviewer should write up an email addressing the review, and  
specifically any issues noted, and return that to this list.


Please volunteer!

Dean

Correction. In my earlier response below I totally misread scenario 4. 
I'm updating my response to it.

	Paul

Pamela,

Are you familiar with:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer-0
9.txt

The race-examples draft and the offeranswer draft got going
independently, with different foci, but there is an area of overlap in
scope. There is a lot in the offeranswer draft that touches on your
cases. In particular, section 4.1 of that document addresses this sort
of thing. I'll say more in line.

I do appreciate your coming at this from a formal model perspective. We
weren't that thorough, and can easily have left holes. We just have to
get your models to adequately reflect reality. (And unfortunately the
reality is sometimes not pretty.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

I think this is indeed a new case. The UAC can't distinguish this from
the case where the re-INVITE 2 was sent even before the prior 200 was
received. But it is very close to what is described in section 14.2 of
3261.

My thought is that the UAC should send a 491 response to the re-INVITE
2. But this case isn't specifically addressed.

The UAC could also try delaying in hope of getting the ACK, but that
seems more trouble.

This *ought* to be addressed in section 4.1 of offeranswer. I just
rewrote that section last weekend because nobody could understand it
before. But sadly it misses this case. Table 4 needs another row or two
to cover this.

This case is declared to be illegal. The rule (not so clear in the RFCs,

INVITE, you cannot initiate another o/a exchange using the 1xx/2xx/PRACK
for that same INVITE. (If you want another o/a exchange before
completing the INVITE you must use UPDATE to do it.)

I think the alarm bells go off for the UAC when it receives the 200 for
the ini-invite. It really shouldn't want to send the ACK yet, because as
far as it is concerned, it has an unanswered offer outstanding.

So my inclination would be that the UAC should just ignore the
200(ini-INVITE), sending no ACK. This will force the UAS to retransmit
it. The UAC doesn't know that the PRACK with answer is enroute, but in
this case it would then probably arrive before the 200 is retransmitted,
so things would recover.

But this is an interesting case to call out.

As I noted above, I just rewrote section 4.1 of the offer/answer draft,
but it is lacking your scenarios 1 & 4. If you have any thoughts on how
to better treat section 4.1 I would be pleased to hear them.

[RL] actually, I think caller here could respond 491 for re-INVITE with
offer here, RFC3311 sec 5.2 has similar case.
<snip>
   If an UPDATE is received that contains an offer, and the UAS has
   generated an offer (in an UPDATE, PRACK or INVITE) to which it has
   not yet received an answer, the UAS MUST reject the UPDATE with a 491
   response.

I don't believe this is a serious issue.

A response to Suresh's complete review is below.

Absolutely correct.

This is a classic single sided authentication situation. If
Alice calls Bob and the attacker mounts a MITM attack, then
it will not be able to impersonate Alice to Bob because it
can't generate the correct RFC 4474 signature. Thus, either
the attacker won't provide a valid signature (being anonymous
from Bob's perspective) or it will produce a valid signature
with its own identity. In either case, this isn't really a
useful MITM attack since Bob thinks he's talking to the
attacker, not to Alice. 

Note the analagous situation with SSL/TLS, where the attacker
can mount an MITM attack, but only with an identity that doesn't
match the identity that the client expects, so it's not
useful.

Good catch. It won't be a downref, though, since the other
draft is also going to PS.

Thanks, I'll fix these.

One of our drafts needs some editorial assistance from somebody that  
has good technical English skills along with a background in XML, as  
well as SIP events, and the time to slog through a bunch of review  
comments.

Please let me know if you're interested in helping out.

If the certificate is self-signed and nonetheless accepted in the
DTLS handshake, then anybody can forge a signature pretending it
comes from Alice, including the MITM attacker (auto-issued
certificates would have the same property). Or did I miss
something?

This is because neither self-signed certificates (at least those that do 
not acquire the "trust anchor" status by "some other means") nor 
auto-issued certificates are allowed in SSL/TLS. Otherwise, 
impersonation is possible. Or did I miss something?

I guess the draft document might proceed only if the man-in-the-middle 
attack is referred to in the security considerations for self-signed 
certificates.

I think we will get into difficulties trying to put legacy usage into
the present draft.

Just catching up on this thread. Basically there are some things that
many B2BUAs/SBCs do for good reason, e.g., media steering, which was
discussed at the last IETF. We need to come up with a solution to e2e
identity that works through B2BUAs that, because of the role they play
(as demanded by their customers, presumably), cannot comply with RFC
3261 rules for proxies. In other words, a solution that a well-meaning
B2BUA vendor could comply with. Of course, we can't deal with the B2BUA
that deliberately sets out to stop e2e identity working.

In trying to address this issue for the last year or more, it is quite
clear that it is difficult to discuss in a structured way. However, I
would suggest the following order of discussion:
- What does a user want to know about the identity of a communication
partner, the authenticity of that identity and the security state of the
communication?
- How important is end-to-end, as opposed to hop-by-hop security
(including authenticated identity)?
- What do we have in our toolkit at present to meet these user
expectations?
- What are the barriers to deploying identity solutions based on these
tools, and what are the root causes of these barriers?
- What mechanisms could be devised for overcoming these deployment
difficulties, and what are the pros and cons of each?
- What are the additional problems arising from the use of E.164-based
URIs, and are there mechanisms that could solve these problems?
- What are the additional problems arising from PSTN interworking, and
are there mechanisms that could solve these problems?

There are already some drafts that address one or more of these points.
But if we were to publish a structure to the discussion in advance, we
could try to solicit drafts addressing particular points.

Hi,

My understanding was that the intention (I guess Jonathan knows best :)
was that this should be a stand-alone draft, to be used as guidence when
defining info-events etc.

Regards,

Christer

Dear ML,

Today I spent some time reading http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-05.txt.
Here are some comments; I apologise if some (or all) of them do not apply due to some 
misunderstanding on my part.

Technical comments:

Section 7.1.4: "If it is signed then it MUST be signed by the same key that is used in the Transport Layer Security mechanism utilized with HTTPS."
Comment: This seems to me to be a mandatory violation of the key seperation principle (see Remark 13.32 in http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap13.pdf).

Section 13.3: Reason phrase "Unknown SAML Assertion Content" 
Comment:  I think that "Assertion Content Not Recognised" makes slightly more sense.

Section 7.1.5, generally
Comment: Assuming that some verification step fails, what is the correct response code? 

Section 7.1.5, generally
Comment: What are the verifier's steps if the assertion is not signed? What is the correct response code in this case? (assuming that the verifier insists on signed assertions)

Section 13.3, generally.
Comment: The document specifies response code 478, but does not seem to specify when it should be used.

Section 7.2, "we assume that a SAML assertion is obtained out-of-band and attached to the body of the SIP message." 
Comment/Questions: How exactly is this attaching done? Who exactly does the attaching? The client? Are intermediaries allowed to do it, too? Must every SIP message receiver parse the body in order to detect the presence of an assertion? Most importantly, what if the SIP message already has/should have a body? How is the existing body merged with the assertion? Is the SAML-Info header *and* an assertion body allowed? If not, what is the error response code?

Section 10: "The attacker could then conceivably attempt to impersonate the subject (the putative caller) to some SIP-based target entity."
Comment: What if the attacker attempts to impersonate the subject to some "non-SIP-based target entity", i.e. some entity that consumes SAML assertions but, since it is not a SIP entity, may follow different verification logic that than described in the document. I think that this attack scenario deserves separate treatment in the security considerations.

Editorial comments:

Section 13.1: "Their syntax is given in Section 9." -> "Its syntax is specified in section 6."

Section 7.1.4.1.1: "The value for the Issuer XML element MUST be a value ..." -> "If the assertion is signed, then the value for the Issuer XML element MUST be a value ..."

That's all for now.

Best Regards,
Andreas

Yes, I think so. NOTIFY would be a mid-dialog request as constructed
with Route header as normal mid-request specified in RFC3261.

This is a key point indeed and I fully agree.

Just don't stop at the need for e2e identity.
It's for everything else as well!

No need to repeat here on why...

All these efforts to accommodate B2BUA are a Faustian bargain that's coming
back for payment - with the soul of IP. Too bad such accommodation efforts
are still going on in the SIP related WGs.

If the UAC lets things get that far, then a 491 might be appropriate. 
But as I noted above, the UAC already has a problem when it gets the 200 
to the initial invite, because it has an incomplete o/a. It doesn't know 
how that is going to work out.

*IF* it decides to send the ACK and then wait for the 200(PRACK), then 
what you suggest makes sense.

If it fails to send the ACK, then that should squelch the possibility of 
getting the reINVITE.

	Thanks,

This draft looks like a keep-alive from -01 - the only change is an  
updated reference to the WG version of events.

I see two directions:
Chapter 7 of info-events enumerates the alternatives for using INFO.  
Thus the straightforward thing to do is fold in whatever we missed  
from Jonathan's draft into info-events. Mea Culpa - I forgot about his  
draft and it passed into the fog since it wasn't on the WG priority  
list. If this is the way to go, what WOULD you like to see?

The other direction is to add to Jonathan's draft and turn it into a  
BCP on UA-UA and UA-Network communication tunneling over SIP. Title  
needs to go, but the INFO text stays, as well as much more development  
on media plane communications.

But then the attacker isn't *intercepting* their communications.
Alice calls Bob and ends up talking to someone but she knows
that she doesn't know who. The point is you can't use this to
mount an MITM attack.

   I think the alarm bells go off for the UAC when it receives the 200 for 
   the ini-invite. It really shouldn't want to send the ACK yet, because as 
   far as it is concerned, it has an unanswered offer outstanding.

I don't think this is a workable solution -- it means that the logic
for handing the INVITE transaction (specifically, sending the ACK) has
to pay attention to the completion status of other transactions.
That's not a good thing to do.

   What do you think?

(It is best not to send a message to both SIP and SIPPING.)

It seems that your formalism is capable of dealing with a real
protocol and discovering problems in it.  I don't know if that has
ever been done before.  We should apply this in the future.

Well, since this is the *200* response to the INVITE, the ACK is s 
separate transaction generated by the UAC Core.

There is no need to delay the ACK if the response is an error response, 
which is the case when the ACK is part of the same transaction.

Because the previous few sentences explicitly state that this is
an MITM:

   In some cases, answerers will not send an UPDATE and in many calls,
   some media will be sent before the UPDATE is received.  In these
   cases, no integrity is provided for the fingerprint from Bob to
   Alice.  In this approach, an attacker that was on the signaling path
   could tamper with the fingerprint and insert themselves as a man-in-
   the-middle on the media.  Alice would know that she had a secure call
   with someone but would not know if it was with Bob or a man-in-the-
   middle.  Bob would know that an attack was happening. 

So, Bob would detect this attack by seeing that the attacker's
credentials didn't match Alice's asserted identity. Or, he
would think (correctly) that he was talking to the attacker,
in which case this isn't an attack!

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-06.txt

Technical Summary

   Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract
   and/or introduction of the document.  If not, this may be 
   an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract
   or introduction.

Working Group Summary

   Was there anything in the WG process that is worth noting?
   For example, was there controversy about particular points 
   or were there decisions where the consensus was
   particularly rough? 

Document Quality

   Are there existing implementations of the protocol?  Have a 
   significant number of vendors indicated their plan to
   implement the specification?  Are there any reviewers that
   merit special mention as having done a thorough review,
   e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a
   conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?  If
   there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type, or other Expert Review,

Well, I think there is some question about whether this is an attack.

Everyone's beliefs about the system are correct:

1. Alice thinks she's talking to Eve. She is.
2. Bob thinks he's talking to Eve. She is.

Note that in this particular case, Alice would presumably hang up the
phone as soon as she realized that Eve gave her a certificate that 
wasn't what she expected. The case in which Alice doesn't detect it
is where Eve doesn't provide a cert and so Alice thinks she's talking
to an unknown person.

I don't think what you're describing works the way you're suggesting
it does, because there is a *handshake* between the peers. Any
asymmetry between the Alice->Bob and Bob->Alice flows is detected
in the handshake.

The IESG has approved the following document:

- 'A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) '
   <draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-06.txt> as an Informational RFC

This document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working 
Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Cullen Jennings and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-06.txt

Technical summary.

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous
specifications that  have been produced by the IETF.  It can be
difficult to locate the right document, or  even to determine the
set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This specification 
serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists the specifications
under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups 
them into categories.


Working group summary.

There is strong consensus in the working group to publish this document.


Document Quality

This document is a summary or compendium of the IETF publications
relating to SIP, and  as such, contains no requirements or RFC 2119 
language, and as such there is no  requirement for implementation 
of this document. The document underwent thorough review by a 
number of experts in both working group last call, and through the
RAI area review process.

It should be noted that once published as an RFC, this is a document that
will need to be regularly revised, as and when sufficient new SIP material
is published to justify a new version.


Personnel

The document shepherd for this document was Keith Drage. The responsible
Area Director was Douglas Adams with some procedural mistakes  from 
Cullen Jennings.

Hi,

The UA should respond with a 481.  In the case of an out of dialog  =

request the *meaning* of the response in this context is easy to  =

understand. A receiving UA realizes that it referred to some dialog  =

that does not exist. There are far too few response codes for us to  =

create a new one in this situation, and it is unlikely that an  =

automaton will be able to recover from this error if it has a  =

different code.

thanks,
-rohan

Yes. The fingerprints in the SIP messages preclude certificate
substitution.

But in DTLS-SRTP the fingerprints in the SIP messages (signed
via RFC 4474) substitute for the certificate chain.

I think you misunderstand the security issues, as discussed above.

Thanks for your reply.
I agree with you, 481 is an enough good response in this case, but I'd real=
ly =

prefer if it was specified in RFC 4235 (it doesn't appear at all).

Thanks a lot.

Eric,

Some comments:

- "and negotiate
   packages from the UAS' subsequent responses and the ACK"
The UAS doesn't send ACK.

- "Once a UAC advertises it is willing to receive a package, it MUST be
   ready to receive INFO methods carrying that package type.  This is
   because the UAS MAY send such INFO requests at the same time as the
   UAS sends its confirming Send-Info header, and the request may arrive
   out of order.  This also enables early exchange of INFO methods."
This does not recognise the fact that the UAS may advertise first (in a
response), in which case the UAS is subject to a similar rule. This
paragraph should be made direction-agnostic.

- "  Similar rules apply for late Send-Info / Recv-Info negotiation,
such
   as an empty INVITE, followed by an offer in the 200 OK and the
   response in the ACK."
I think this is too vague for a normative section. In fact, as it is,
this statement is not normative, but there should be normative
statements regarding receiving in 1xx/2xx (not having sent in INVITE
request) and sending in ACK request.

- I think I suggested once before that we should not treat
Send-Info/Recv-Info exchanges like offer/answer, but should just have a
simple rule that says that a UA can send these header fields at any time
and they supersede any sent previously. A UA MUST not send INFO unless
the package has been identified in the last Send-Info sent and the last
Recv-Info received. A UA MUST (SHOULD?) discard a received INFO unless
the package has been identified in the last Recv-Info sent, and MUST be
prepared to receive an INFO for a package as soon as it has sent a
Recv-Info identifying that package. These header fields MAY be included
in an INVITE request, in a dialog-forming response to an INVITE request,
or in any other request or response in the context of an early or full
INVITE-initiated dialog. This would be a lot simpler. Is there any
reason it would not work? I am not certain I have enumerated all the
rules here, but I doubt if very much more would need to be said
normatively.

Another advantage of this would be that there would be no need to use
the special terminology in section 3 whereby UAC is specifically the UAC
for the INVITE request and the UAS is the UAS for the INVITE request.
This gets particularly confusing when considering a re-INVITE or UPDATE
request initiated by the UA that was the UAS for the original INVITE
request. Furthermore, in section 4 terminology reverts to the more
orthodox meanings of UAC and UAS. So even if we don't adopt my
suggestion above for getting rid of pair-wise exchanges of
Send-Info/Recv-Info, I think something should be done to avoid the
unorthodox terminology in section 3.

- "If the payload of the INFO method has multiple body parts, the UAC
   SHOULD identify which body part belongs to a given Info Package.  The
   UAC does this by adding the modifier ";cid=<identifier>" to the Info-
   Package header field value, where "<identifier>" is the Content-ID
   MIME header value corresponding to the body part associated with the
   Info-Package.  The sole exception to this rule is if the particular
   Info Package carries no payload.  In this case there will be no body
   part associated with the Info Package and thus there will be no
   Content-ID to reference.  In this case, the UAC MUST NOT include the
   "cid" modifier."
Why not simply say:
"If the payload of the INFO method has multiple body parts, the UAC
   MUST identify which body part (if any) belongs to a given Info
Package.  The
   UAC does this by adding the modifier ";cid=<identifier>" to the Info-
   Package header field value, where "<identifier>" is the Content-ID
   MIME header value corresponding to the body part associated with the
   Info-Package. Some Info Packages may not involve the conveyance of a
body part."?
This would avoid using SHOULD - it is always preferable to use a
conditioned MUST.

- "1.  Recall the response code to an INFO method request relates to the
       INFO method request itself, "
Nothing has been stated previously about response codes to INFO
requests, so it is difficult to recall this! Delete "Recall".

"If the UAS receives an INFO request with a Info-Package the UAC
   advertised with a Send-Info in the last dialog state update"
It was not clear to me that every dialog state update MUST contain
Send-Info/Recv-Info. In other words, if I send an UPDATE request without
these header fields, e.g., for session timer refresh, does this cancel
any previous negotiation of Info Packages? I would prefer that it did
not, that it simply left things unchanged.

- "If a server receives an INFO request with a body it understands, but
   it has no Info-Package header, the UAS MAY render the body."
This is the first mention of "render". In fact there is nothing to say
that a UAS must/should/may render a body when an INFO request is not in
error, so it seems odd to talk about rendering when there is an apparent
error in the INFO request. Is "rendering" necessarily the appropriate
thing to do with a received and valid INFO request. Should we instead
say "...the UAS MAY make use of the body"?

- "The UAS MUST send a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist message
   if the INFO request does not match any existing dialog."
Shouldn't this say "...does not match any INVITE-initiated dialog"?

- "The INFO message MUST NOT change the state of the SIP dialog.  The
   only exception to this rule is for specific failure responses as
   documented in RFC 5057 [RFC5057], which may cause the INVITE dialog
   to terminate."
It is odd to say "MUST NOT" and then state that there is an exception.
Should it be a "SHOULD NOT"?

- "A UAC, the sender of the OPTIONS request, MAY include Send-Info and
   Recv-Info headers, populated appropriately for the packages the UAC
   supports.  The UAS MAY include its set of Send-Info and Recv-Info
   packages.  The UAS and UAC MUST NOT consider the OPTIONS request to
   be part of a capabilities negotiation.  The OPTIONS request is purely
   a probe."
The semantics of these header fields in an INVITE request or another
message in an INVITE-initiated dialog means I am prepared to
send/receive these packages in the context of this dialog. However, for
OPTIONS there is no dialog. So what exactly are the semantics of these
header fields in OPTIONS request? Presumably it just means I support
these packages and may be prepared to send/receive them in the context
of an INVITE-initiated dialog. This should be clarified.

- "The UAS MAY include its set of Send-Info and Recv-Info
   packages."
Presumably this should say "... in a 2xx response to an OPTIONS
request".

- "For the UAC or UAS to renegotiate package support, they must use the
   procedures described in Section 3."
Change "renegotiate" to "negotiate" (since OPTIONS does not negotiate).

- "That is, when the
   UAC sends another INFO request before receiving a transaction
   response from the UAS to a prior INFO request."
This is an incomplete sentence. Presumably it should say "... the
requests can arrive at the UAS out of order".

- In 5.1, Why is Contact allowed in an INFO request but not in a 2xx
response to INFO? Since INFO is not allowed to change dialog state, it
cannot change target URIs, so what would be the meaning of Contact in an
INFO request. I think we should align with BYE and not allow Contact in
INFO.

- Why is Max-Breadth allowed in an INFO request, given that it cannot
fork?

- In 5.2, why are Send-Info and Recv-Info not allowed in UPDATE requests
and responses? In fact in 3.1 it says it is allowed.

- "For the purposes of matching Info Package types indicated in Send-
   Info or Recv-Info with those in the Info-Package header field value,
   one compares the Info-package-name portion of the Info-package-type
   portion of the "Info-Package" header byte-by-byte with that of the
   same in the "Send-Info" or "Recv-Info" header values."
Presumably comparison is case-sensitive. Should we state this?

John

Dan,
 =

Thanks for pointing out this relationship between the two drafts. I probabl=
y should have referenced your's from mine. There is some overlap, although =
there is material in yours that is not covered in mine, to do with the natu=
re of the indication (limitations w.r.t. fonts, display size, etc.). Mine p=
robably explores the meaning of such an indicator in more depth. If there i=
s interest in doing work in this area, we may wish to merge the two.

John

	FYI, at Victor Pascual =C1vila's request (thank you, Victor), I updated my=
 I-D about the need for a common visual identifier for trusted identity to =
reflect the feedback I had received after the initial posting back in July.=
  The document is now available at:  =


	http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-york-sip-visual-identifier-trust=
ed-identity-01.txt

	and comments are certainly welcome.

	However, I'd note that John Elwell has included many of the issues I raise=
d into his much more comprehensive draft at:

	http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-sip-identity-handling-ua-=
00.txt

	particularly in sections 2.7 and 2.8.  Given that, the value in my narrowe=
r draft is questionable to me and so I may not be updating it further.   (O=
nce today's submission deadline is passed, I will be reviewing John's docum=
ent and sending him comments.)

	Regards,

I do not believe this draft represents the consensus that we have  
agree in the SIP WG .

This does not work for TCP. Reverse DNS lookup is not strong enough to  
replace TLS. I'm not even interested in discussing the reason why yet  
again but I would like to see the draft updated to reflect the WG  
consensus. To do this it need to say MUST use TLS. Having it allow  
straight SCTP and TCP when the reverse DNS or some other unspecified  
thing happens is not what we agreed to.  This can be fixed by changing  
a few words and deleting a sentence or two in security consideration.  
I'm glad to send edits if you want.

This draft is important for the SIP Connect work - lets make these  
changes to what we agreed to and get this finished quickly.

I like it.

On your Open Issue, I'd say yes. Imagine a B2BUA type PBX forming a  
connection to service provider. You'd want to keep it up pretty much  
forever.

It seems odd to me that a revision of 3261 would need to normatively  
reference SIP-T or SCTP. These seem like they should be extensions.

I think it would be a good idea if this specification mandated support  
for draft-ietf-sip-body-handling. WIthout this we are going to be into  
a nightmare of understanding how to deal with multiple bodies.

(As WG chair)

Well I went looking for any consensus you are referring to.

In the limited time I have available I failed to find it.

Can you be more explicit about when you think a decision was made in
this respect, and whether it was on list or in a meeting.

Please note by the way that I believe the document has been in pretty
much its current form for at least 18 months.

regards

Keith

Hi Dean,

I read this document and I have the following comments 

1) Section 4.2 didn't mention any thing about contact header. Second
para says "Anonymous IP addressed are needed for two purposes" those are
via and address in SDP for media. Later section 5.1.1 refers back to
section 4.2

So I would like to see some description about contact also in section
4.2. If anonymous IP address from STUN relay server is used for contact,
I think all subsequent sip signaling has to go via STUN relay server.

2)  Section 4.1 last para: what is third party GRUU server? (I assume
its a registrar outside the domain?). Are there any SIP mechanisms to
achieve the functionality described in this para? 

If yes, I like to see some description.
If no, Please state some thing like mechanisms outside the scope of this
document or this is for future standardization etc.

3) section 5.1.2 last para: Similar comments as point 2 above.

Regards
Krishna

Subject: [Sip] Volunteer op: Request formal reviews for UA Initiated
Privacy


I'd like to request several people to review the UA Initiated Privacy
draft in conjunction with the WGLC that we expect to start shortly.

See:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-03.txt


Such reviews should look at:

1) Readability -- does the draft, as written, make sense? Are the
examples clear?

2) Technical correctness: Are the recommendations of the draft valid?  
Are they consistent with our other specifications, and if not, does the
draft clearly explain these inconsistencies and give a rationale?

Each reviewer should write up an email addressing the review, and
specifically any issues noted, and return that to this list.


Please volunteer!

Dean

I agree with everything you have said, and I this is the same 
understanding I had from the draft. The case I was concerned about 
involves the attacker impersonating Bob towards Alice, since he can 
modify the fingerprint and the certificates, thus becoming capable of 
intercepting their communications. This attack is not detectable by Bob.

Thanks
Suresh

Again. I agree with what you said. What I was commenting on is the 
following text from the draft

"Bob would know that an attack was happening.  The fact that
  one side can detect this attack means that in most cases where Alice
  and Bob both wish the communications to be encrypted there is not a
  problem."

My question was, how would Bob detect this attack?

Thanks

I still don't see how Bob detects the attack. Consider the following 
message flow.

1) Alice->Bob : INVITE (Fingerprint(Alice)) (No Tampering)
2) Alice->Bob : Certificate(Alice) (No Tampering)
3) Bob->Eve   : Certificate(Bob)
4) Eve->Alice : Certificate(Eve)
5) Bob->Eve   : 200 OK (Fingerprint(Bob))
6) Eve->Alice : 200 OK (Fingerprint(Eve))
7) Alice->Eve : Media encrypted with Eve's public key
8) Eve->Bob   : Media (potentially different from step 7) encrypted with 
Bob's public key

After this exchange Eve can intercept and modify media flowing from 
Alice to Bob without Bob detecting the attack.

Thanks
Suresh

Yes.

Not really. Bob thinks he is talking to Alice. The identity, fingerprint 
and certificate of his peer in the signaling exchange belong to Alice. 
He is encrypting all the outgoing media for Alice.

It doesn't need to mandate, because the mandate is elsewhere.

sip-body-handling is a mandatory update to RFC 3261.

This uses RFC 3261 as updated by sip-body-handling.

It does need to be sufficiently clear.

Keith

Hi Rohan,

is this our wishful thinking (I would like it too for it simplifies few
things) only, or is there a normative reference (which I can't find).
The way I read the related stuff is I get a 200 for the SUB back, and
an "empty" NOTIFY.

Hi Jiri,

I am just saying that you if you send a 481 in this case, the  =

semantics are clear and consistent with some other event package that  =

uses call-id attributes. If you receive a 481 in this case you can  =

act accordingly. You could also get back a NOTIFY with a body with  =

full state with no dialogs, but this is less useful.

thanks,
-rohan

I think this will work as long as he contents of these headers on one 
side are not coupled with those on the other side. IOW, I should be able 
to mention a package in Recv-Info even if it wasn't mentioned by the 
other side, and visa versa.

But can somebody remind me why we need Send-Info at all?

However in any case we must accept that there is a race condition, when 
an INFO is in flight at the same time as a Recv-Info in the other 
direction that forbids sending it. I think that is fine - it will just 
be rejected, and that should not be considered a serious error.

We need to be careful here, to prevent breaking 3pcc. If a transfer is 
done via 3pcc, how can we ensure that the desires of the unchanged party 
are made known to the transfer target? This could be ensured that the 
Send-Info/Recv-Info headers are always sent when an offer or answer is sent.

Yeah, "render" could be quite confusing. Perhaps "process"?

INVITE-dialog-usage?

(I could have a dialog that was initiated with an INVITE, then 
piggybacked with a SUBSCRIBE, then BYE to the INVITE, but subscription 
remains. That is still an INVITE-initiated dialog, but INFO isn't valid.)

This jogs another question in my mind. Is it permissible to pass 
Send-Info / Recv-Info headers in an INFO? If so, then IMO those change 
the state of the dialog.

I agree. (I have similar problems with everything in an OPTIONS.)

Agree.

By default I would assume case-insensitive behavior. That is the norm 
for most things. Is there a reason to be case sensitive here?

The answer is currently no.

INVITE and 1xx,2xx responses to INVITE, OPTIONS and 2xx responses to
OPTIONS.

REG was still under discussion although it is the draft.

I think I understand the question. Let's check.

Bob is talking, but nobody hears what he says, since he's encrypted it  
for Alice but Alice isn't getting it. Bob may well notice that there's  
something strange here.

An attacker in this position could also have affected things such that  
the call never reaches Bob. His phone doesn't ring, and Bob isn't  
talking to anybody. So how does he know there's an attack? Why would  
Eve have even allowed any signaling to get to Bob in the first place  
if she had this sort of control?

Bob can't detect the attack, and this is not an issue with DTLS-SRTP;  
it's a fundamental aspect of the signaling model.

However, Alice, who is the only party here that's honestly engaged in  
a call and saying something that could be intercepted, CAN detect the  
attack. That's the important piece.

[JRE] I don't object to mandating it, if this is what it takes to make
it work in a 3PCC environment. Is it clear to everyone what "dialog
state update" means?

[JRE] I am happy for it to be case-insensitive, but the most likely
interpretation of the existing words is case-sensitive.

RFC4474 signatures are optional in this draft, isn't it?

I agree that RFC4474 signatures introduce end-to-end authentication that 
has the potential to counter MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks. I thougth 
the discussions of this draft pertained to use cases without such 
end-to-end signatures.

Maybe. Worse, I am reluctant to trust those who claim to understand 
security issues! Protocol security issues are reasonably understandable 
after the fact, when attackers applied their skills and creativity on 
fielded implementations.

Attackers skills and creativity has the potential to create MITM schemes 
(e.g. with sophisticated application-level proxies) when end-to-end 
cryptographic authentication is missing from a protocol arrangement.


Anyway, turning more to the point of document progress, I must admit 
that the security considerations section indeed DOES refer to MITM 
("active attack") in the last paragraph of introductory section 8. I beg 
apologies for my earlier unsupported critique.

Oh no, Cullen; don't say that!  We went through a lot of list
discussion to get the consensus text you see in the draft now.

More inline.

The issue is that connect-reuse ought to be done only over TLS.
That much everyone agrees to.  However, during the -09 revision,
we had a long discussion on the list about allowing connection
reuse over TCP (and SCTP) assuming certain caveats related to
trust relationship between the peers doing the reuse are in place.
This discussion happened during Nov 20, 2007 - Nov 26, 2007.

On Dec 13, 2007, following a 1-slide status update during
the Vancouver IETF, I had presented on the list for ratification
a summary of the consensus reached during November 2007 (please see
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg21723.html).

Following this, -09 was released on Feb. 8, 2008 (please
see http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg22022.html).

> This draft is important for the SIP Connect work - lets make these

Astonishingly enough, connection reuse over TCP is probably
most attractive to the SIPConnect work, where the PBX has a
trust relationship with the service provider and is willing
to trust the SP to send requests in the backwards direction.
I do not think TLS is widely deployed (yet) in SIPConnect.

In short, the draft as you see it now reflects the consensus
we had reached during the November 2007 timeframe.  The bulk
of the substantive material has remained the same since then,
with the subsequent revisions attending to typos and such.

Thanks,

So maybe the draft should mention in section 8.1, second paragraph, also
the possibility that an attacker may only impersonate B, without doing a
full MITM-attack.

Dean,

(Moving back to the SIP list, which accidentally got dropped from cc list a=
 few postings ago).

Yes, I was wondering whether SAML would fit in here somehow. =

I have reviewed this draft. In my opinion it is almost ready to go,
apart from fixing a few minor points listed below and a few nits sent
separately to the authors.

1. "The UA-driven privacy mechanism defined in this document will not
   eliminate the need for RFC 3323 usage defined in [RFC3325] which
   instructs privacy service to delete P-Asserted-Identity header.  In
   order to delete a P-Asserted-Identity header, a user agent needs to
   set Privacy:id even when the user agent is utilizing this
   specification."
I don't think this quite captures everything. I would suggest the
following rewording:
"The UA-driven privacy mechanism defined in this document will not
eliminate the need for the RFC 3323 usage defined in [RFC3325], which
instructs a privacy service not to forward a P-Asserted-Identity header
field outside the Trust Domain.  In order to prevent forwarding a
P-Asserted-Identity header field outside the Trust Domain, a user agent
needs to include the Privacy header field with value 'id' (Privacy:id)
in the request, even when the user agent is utilizing this
specification."

2. "privacy-sensitive information:
               The information that identifies a user who sends the SIP
               message, as well as the supplementary information that
               can be used to guess the user's identity."
I would suggest we change "the supplementary information" to "other
information".

3. "The concept of privacy in this document is the act of concealing
   identity of a user and supplementary information."
I would suggest we change to:
"The concept of privacy in this document is the act of concealing
   privacy-sensitive information."
(since we already have a definition of privacy-sensitive information)

4. "Some fields of SIP messages that potentially contain privacy-
   sensitive information do not interfere with establishing dialog and
   can be omitted without any side effects.  Other fields are essential
   for establishing dialog and need to have its value replaced to
   anonymized values in order to obscure privacy-sensitive information."
Establishing dialogs is not the sole purpose of SIP messages. Some SIP
messages are mid-dialog, and others are not dialog-related at all. I
would propose:
"Some fields of a SIP message potentially contain privacy-sensitive
information but are not essential for achieving the intended purpose of
the message and can be omitted without any side effects.  Other fields
are essential for achieving the intended purpose of the message and need
to contain anonymized values in order to avoid disclosing
privacy-sensitive information."

5. "If the Registrar supports the GRUU and returns a REGISTER response,
   the user agent SHOULD search within the REGISTER response for a
   "temp-gruu" URI parameter, which provides the desired privacy
   property.  If the "temp-gruu" URI parameter and value is present
   within the REGISTER response, the user agent SHOULD use the value of
   the "temp-gruu" as an anonymous URI representing the user agent.
   This URI SHOULD be used for the Contact header in subsequent requests
   and responses."
It is not clear why each of these "SHOULD"s are not "MUST"s. The first
paragraph of 4.1 already allows an exception to use of GRUU where the UA
is able to obtain a functional anonymous URI by other means. I think the
present paragraph is only concerned with the case where GRUU is to be
used, so "MUST" would be appropriate for each normative statement.
However, I also think the paragraph should begin with a qualification
and a requirement to request GRUU. Also I think the present first
sentence is redundant. Finally, there are some cases where the temp-gruu
URI is unsuitable for placing in a Contact header field (e.g., in a 302
response). So I would propose:
"In order to use the GRUU mechanism to obtain a functional anonymous
URI, the UA MUST request GRUU in the REGISTER request. If a "temp-gruu"
URI parameter and value are present in the REGISTER response, the user
agent MUST use the value of the "temp-gruu" as an anonymous URI
representing the user agent. This means that the user agent MUST use
this URI as its local target and MUST place this URI in the Contact
header field of subsequent requests and responses that require the local
target to be sent."

6. "IP address of the media relay"
Since we are also considering using a relay for the IP address to be
used in Via, it is then not a media relay. Suggest change to:
"IP address of a relay".

7. "Furthermore, when a user agent uses relay server to conceal its
   identity, the user agent MUST send requests to the relay server to
   ensure request and response bypass the same signaling path."
I think the intention here is to say:
"Furthermore, when a user agent uses a relay server to conceal its
identity, the user agent MUST send requests to the relay server to
ensure request and response follow the same signaling path."

8. "Without privacy considerations, this field contains a URI used to
   reach the user agent for mid-dialog requests and possibly out-of-
   dialog requests, such as REFER [RFC3515].  The Contact header field
   can also contain a display-name.  Since the Contact header field is
   used for routing further requests to the user agent, it must include
   a functional URI even when it is anonymized."
This is not quite true. It does not apply to the Contact header field in
REGISTER requests or in 3xx responses. Perhaps it should begin "When
using this header field in a dialog-forming request or response or in a
mid-dialog request or response, this field contains the local target,
i.e., a URI used to reach the user agent for mid-dialog requests and
possibly out-of-dialog requests, such as REFER [RFC3515]...."

9. "A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification MUST anonymize a Contact header using an anonymous URI
   ("temp-gruu")..." 
Again this is not quite accurate. Suggest:
"When using this header field in a dialog-forming request or response or
in a mid-dialog request or response, the user agent MUST anonymize the
Contact header field using an anonymous URI ("temp-gruu")..."

9. In the same paragraph: "or an anonymous URI
   containing an IP address obtained through the TURN mechanism"
The discussion of TURN in section 4 mentioned its use only for Via and
SDP, not for Contact. I think we should delete these words (and also the
words relating to TURN in the next paragraph).

10. "However, the SIP-Identity will fail with the From
   header of option 1 because the SIP-Identity mechanism uses
   authentication based on the domain name."
I would not say that it will fail. I would prefer to say that it cannot
be used:
"However, SIP-Identity cannot be used with a From header field in
accordance with option 1, because the SIP-Identity mechanism uses
authentication based on the domain name."

11. "If a user agent is aware that SIP-Identity mechanism will be
applied
   to the request"
I would prefer to say:
"If a user agent expects the SIP-Identity mechanism to be applied to the
request"

12. "5.1.2.  From Header Field"
This entire sub-section applies only to From in requests, not in
responses. This should be made clear throughout. Or simply change the
title to "5.1.2.  From Header Field in requests". Similar considerations
apply to Via (5.1.3).

John

I've had several people comment that their reading list is driven  
exclusively by what appears on agendas at meetings.

This draft does not appear on any such agenda.

Its probably worth poking people repeatedly to stimulate comments if  
you want any.

That said, I am assuming that this WGLC is intended to stimulate  
discussion on the draft instead of meaning "we think this is ready to  
publish - everybody take a last look at it" kind of LC, since it still  
contains things like:

> 12.  Security Considerations
>
>    TBD

I'll send my comments in a separate message.

   yes, the current I-D specifies the latter; what has been called "global"
   in the email threads. The idea was to be consistent with email. However,
   I agree with the conclusions of the email discussions. That is, using
   the "local" approach probably makes more sense in a SIP context.

I don't see that that change has been made in -04.  In particular (as
Rockson notes) section 7.2 still gives the "global" interpretation.

(My suggested amendments of 3 Nov still stand, of course.)

Comments (in major, minor, nit order)

Major:
maj-1) Do we have a constituency willing to finish this work? It has a  
ways to go and the number of commenters has been pretty small. Does  
anyone know of any attempts to implement this yet?

maj-2) -02 is an improvement over -00, but the basic architectural  
intent is still not clear (as evidenced by the remaining open issue in  
section 5 - in fact I think this is the _REAL_ open issue that the  
thing in section 5 is pointing to). An implementer would probably  
benefit from a short overview section that outlined the mechanics.

maj-3) The document defines an option tag but doesn't say what it  
means if it shows up in a Require: header.

maj-4) The Security Considerations section is empty. I've pointed  
already (in my comments to -00) of at least one situation we need to  
discuss here (It said "For instance, I can spoof 199s to affect how a  
call is ultimately answered in ways that are different (from the  
endpoints visibility into what happened point-of-view) from cancels/ 
byes or even other response manipulation.) We need some focused  
discussion to uncover any other issues this new behavior is bringing  
to the system.

maj-5) (I waffled on putting this into minor, but I've made this  
comment before and it hasn't been sufficiently addressed). The  
document needs to be more explicit in explaining how it might be that  
a single 3-6xx response showing up at a proxy might cause it to send  
more than one 199. Something like http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/example.png 
  perhaps.

maj-6) The document should discuss what a proxy should do if a 199  
shows up for an early dialog it's already generated its own 199 about.
(This might happen, for instance, if a 3-6xx and a 199 crossed on the  
wire or were reordered by previous elements on the way to this proxy).

maj-7) Section 7 on backwards compatibility is really confusing and  
doesn't stand up against some edge situations. In particular, it  
doesn't act right when a request comes in that's a retransmission or a  
merge. It could also be misinterpreted (a stretch, but I've seen this  
stretch) to constrain UASes to send a 481 to an ACK. I suggest we get  
together in the hall at IETF73 and collaboratively wordsmith a  
replacement for this section.

maj-8) What is the purpose of section 8? I suspect it should just be  
deleted.

maj-9) Section 9 allows a 199 to contain SDP. Why? This document  
should either forbid that practice or explicitly document why it is  
allowed.


Minor:
min-1) (I waffled on putting this into major): This entire mechanism  
is an optimization, but the word optimization is never used. This is  
(as discussed so far) ONLY an optimization and should be explicitly  
described as such (including documenting the limitations of the  
optimization).

min-2) The document uses "upstream" and "downstream" throughout its  
text. We can probably find a way to replace those terms with something  
less likely to induce confusion especially when translating to other  
languages.

min-3) The abstract shows the architectural confusion I call out in  
maj-2. Its not clear what elements use the 199 in this description.  
The most likely interpretation of the given text is just the UAC.

min-4) The last sentence of the 5th paragraph of the Introduction  
(which starts "When SIP entities upstream receive") says SIP entities  
but talk about things that only UACs can do, specifically terminating  
the session startup.

min-5) Paragraph 1 of section 4 (Client Behavior) can be read to say a  
UAC MUST always insert a Supported:199. It should start with a  
conditional clause such as "If the client wants to receive 199  
responses, then".

min-6) Item 5 in section 4.1 talks about dialogs being "inactive"  
which doesn't have meaning - I think it meant to say "the sessions  
associated with some early dialogs may be set to inactive".

min-7) Section 5 should be titled "User-Agent Server" behavior to  
avoid confusion with Proxies.

min-8) (This will be major later in the review process if it's still  
there when we get there). Section 6 uses 2119 capitalized words to  
restate requirements from other, already published and referenced,  
documents. This is a practice we should work hard to avoid. I suggest  
replacing the first two sentences with "A proxy will forward a  
received 199 response as it is required to forward all other non-100  
provisional responses by RFC 3261." Similarly, the last paragraph of  
section 7 should not use 2119 capitalized words.

min-9) The part of section 6 that talks about the proxy generating  
199s on its own would be clearer if it were structured around the  
generation of multiple 199s for a given 3-6xx with the case of only  
one 199 being generated falling out as a special case. (currently it  
documents the 1 final response makes 1 provisional response and calls  
out the multiple-199 case as an exception/extension later in the  
section).

Nit:
nit-1) "resrouces" occurs several times in section 4.1

nit-2) The document still contains [ref needed] when talking about ICE  
in section 4.1

nit-3) The Note in section 4.1 has a reference to RFC3261 ostensibly  
about SRTP. Did it mean to point to an SRTP document instead?

nit-4) "intial" appears in section 5

nit-5) Suggest replacing "triggers a 199 response" in section 10 with  
"generates a 199 response"

Folks,

There's currently 30 minutes on the agenda for SIP on Thursday for a  
session labelled
"SIP Draft Standard Work".

I plan to use this time to discuss/refine how we are going to move  
forward in the short term
with maintaining/refining the core SIP standard given that we have the  
strong sense that it's
not time to try to advance SIP to Draft Standard.

I intend to split the interoperability statement list in draft-sparks- 
sip-to-draft out into a document
that stands by itself. I want to discuss how we're going to use this  
list going forward. I expect the
discussions in the raiarea meeting to influence this conversation.

We will likely end up talking about the essential-corrections process  
as part of those discussions.
Please make sure you've reviewed Keith's draft at
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-drage-sip-essential-correction-03 if  
you haven't done so recently.
It would also be useful to skim the invfix draft ahead of time to have  
its format fresh in your mind.

I'm currently planning to have very few slides, reserving the bulk of  
the time to microphone discussion.

RjS

Due to a perceived lack of issues, UA Initiated privacy has been  
removed from the Monday session agenda.

We have placed the "199" draft (early termination), which is a  
chartered Working Group deliverable, into that slot on request of its  
editor.

I've spent quite a bit of time over the past few days pondering the 
approach laid out in the DERIVE draft. I think the approach of using 
some form of "dial-back" to confirm identity has some merit (with a few 
very strong caveats). I think the idea of leveraging already-defined 
behavior is a good idea and somewhat clever; however, I suspect that the 
exact mechanism defined in the current draft is not yet well enough 
deployed for us to accept the limitations that it imposes.


The Need For User-Visible Caveats
=================================

As we've seen with the XMPP system, dial-back approaches can be used 
with a fair amount of success to prevent certain types of identity 
spoofing (see XEP-0220). Caveats associated with this approach in 
general include reliance on security of the DNS and IP routing systems. 
We have seen real-world attacks on bot h in the past [1][2], so we need 
to make sure that user expectations for any dial-back system are set 
appropriately.


SIP and Return Routability of AORs
==================================

However, when the flexibility of SIP routing is thrown into the mix, the 
ability to reliably route back to the calling user's specific device 
using that user's AOR becomes a much larger issue.

For example, a caller at a call center my well advertise a calling 
identity that reflects the contact point for that call center as their 
"From" identity. However, calls made to that identity will either reach 
an IVR or be dispatched to a random call center device that has no 
knowledge of the calling party's dialog. Other normal subscribed 
services, such as time-of-day routing, can have similar results. 
Further, interaction with find-me-follow-me services -- or, really, any 
service with serial forking -- can potentially result in dramatic 
post-dial-delays that make execution of such a call-back service infeasible.

All of which is to say: any dial-back attempt using an AOR may 
legitimately reach a device (or several devices) without reaching the 
calling party's actual device. I would therefore assert that any 
dial-back based strictly on AOR can at best confirm the veracity of the 
"To" header field (with the DNS and routing caveats I mention above). It 
cannot, under any circumstances, *refute* a claim.


Dialog-Package Re-Use
=====================

The actual use of the dialog event package in the DERIVE draft is 
clever. The idea of being able to deploy a system based on what is 
already in the field is very attractive, as it allows us to put the 
solution into play immediately. However, based on results at SIPits, it 
is supported by somewhere less than 50% of current UA implementations 
(the estimate I got was "probably about one out of three").

That's actually not a bad percentage, especially considering that the 
incidence of dialog package implementation should only go up -- it has 
immense value in a number of useful services. However, the behavior that 
the dialog event package needs to exhibit to support DERIVE is not 
sufficiently well defined in RFC 4325. We've had a number of SIP experts 
weigh in on the SIP mailing list with widely differing opinions about 
how UAs *should* operate. And if *we* can't figure it out, I can 
guarantee that implementors have done... let's use the work 
"innovative"... things in this space.

In other words, I fear that whatever gains we achieve by re-using the 
dialog event package are largely negated by the fact that we're using 
the very aspects of it that have been most poorly specified.


Potential Alternate Approaches
==============================

If we don't re-use the dialog event package as-is, then we need to 
either find some other widely-deployed, well-defined UA behavior that we 
can leverage, or we need to define new behavior on both the caller and 
callee equipment. I can't immediately think of a solution that falls 
into the former category -- perhaps someone else can come up with 
something clever. That leaves defining some new mechanism to address a 
call-back mechanism. Jiri has suggest defining a new method for 
call-back validation, and I think this is a reasonable approach.

Regardless of the approach taken, I would suggest that we should 
leverage the use of public GRUUs to assist with routing to the proper 
device. Devices that validate the identity of an incoming request can 
render the public GRUU (with the ;gr parameter stripped) as the calling 
party identity after they use it to reach the exact calling device. With 
GRUUs thrown into the mix, we get around the issue of potentially being 
unable to reach the calling party devices -- this allows us to return 
actual negative hits in addition to positive hits.

In fact, if the calling party is using a GRUU, we might be able to 
achieve some interesting results by taking the GRUU out of the Contact 
header-field of the INVITE and sending back an innocuous in-dialog 
request of some kind (UPDATE? OPTIONS? Dare I say INFO?) *without* any 
route headers to see whether we get a 481 response...


Conclusion
==========

In short, I support work towards dial-back "better than nothing" style 
security. And, while I commend the authors of DERIVE for their 
ingenuity, I fear that the dialog event package is a poor enough fit 
that we should explore other alternatives before going too far down this 
path.

That's true.
Description about contact is missing in 4.2.
We will add some text.

We would like to add the text to explain that
the mechanism of third party GRUU server is
out of scope of this document.

Add the text to explain the mechanism of
third party anonymization service is out of scope, too.

Hold on a minute - are we sure the notifier should send a 481?

I have always thought about the call-id, and tag Event package =

parameters as essentially a filter - that is only send me notifies about =

this particular dialog.  If I subscribe to an event package with a =

filter, but nothing matches the filter at that moment, would we normally =

expect the subscription to be refused?  Instead, I would expect an =

immediate notification saying subscription is created but then not get =

any notifications until the filter conditions are met.   Or is my =

understanding of how filtering works wrong?

As such, I think it still works - if the subscriber does not receive any =

notifications that match the dialog, he does not get the DERIVE =

authentication he is after.

Thanks,
Alan

Hi Alan,

I don't think of the Event package parameters as a filter in the same  =

sense as a filter body in the SUBSCRIBE request. The main difference  =

here is that it is not meaningful to think about updating the Event  =

package parameters for the same subscription, while it is perfectly  =

acceptable to modify a SUBSCRIBE filter body.

thanks,
-rohan

One questions about the scope of this work ... are people only trying  
to make it work for email style address or is the scope to also try  
for E.164 style addresses? I think it is important to be clear about  
this when looking at any Forward Routing Verification or Return  
Routing Verification type scheme. I also think in any identity scheme,  
it's important to be clear what the trust relationship is between all  
the sip elements.

Hi,
=20
Should a to-tag be added to a 487 response to an initial INVITE? Even if
180 Ringing has not been sent?

Hi All,

487 response will be generated only when a CANCEL will be generated for =

I can't help remembering how hard it was for network designers to give up SNA addressing (at that time used for 80%-90% of the data networks) for IP addresses.

Is anyone really thinking there are new, future applications and services that may use E.164?
If so, it would be interesting to know what they may be. An example would help.
Sure, there is the huge installed base of E.164, but so was SNA.

This is not a valid reason to reject Derive.
In this light, the limitations of Derive are very acceptable IMO.

One questions about the scope of this work ... are people only trying

this when looking at any Forward Routing Verification or Return
Routing Verification type scheme. I also think in any identity scheme,
it's important to be clear what the trust relationship is between all
the sip elements.

It is not required to have a CANCEL before sending a 487 response for
the call leg A-B. In this case, is it mandatory that a 487 response
contains a to-tag?

Sunil

Hi All,

=20

487 response will be generated only when a CANCEL will be generated for
a pending INVITE message. CANCEL request has all the information, like
which request with all mandatory header field. A cancel will be
generated from a proxy otherwise same UA which has generated invite. 487
will be responded by the other party. So its not at all require to have
To tag in non 2xx responces for invite.

=20

Please comment.=20

Thanks

Hi,
=20
Should a to-tag be added to a 487 response to an initial INVITE? Even if
180 Ringing has not been sent?

I'm inclined to think of it in much this way, but there are some odd =

twists to it:

- These options (or filter) also serve as data used for authentication
   and authorization. Namely, possessing a valid dialog id is considered
   a form of identity, that is then coupled to authorization to subscribe
   with a limitation on seeing only data about that dialog.

- IMO it can be assumed that if someone supplies the notifier with what
   should be one of its own dialog ids, and it isn't currently defined,
   then it won't be valid in the future, and so should not serve as a
   valid identification. So such a subscription should fail, except
   perhaps if the subscriber can be authorized to subscribe on some
   other basis.

On that basis, I can see a 403 response if the dialog id isn't valid and =

the subscriber has no intrinsic authorization to subscribe.

I understand the reasoning behind 481 but I am a *bit* troubled by it. =

It is a distinct semantic for 481, though one that is unambiguous. But =

481 already has three distinct meanings, so adding another doesn't seem =

like a great idea.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Yes.  RFC 3261 Section 8.2.6.2:

Thanks Michael,

I was searching for similar questions and I found the following query by
Christer, christer.holmberg@ericsson.com:

---------------------------------------
Hi,

Chapter of 3261 says:

"However, if the To header field in the request did not contain a tag,
the URI in the To
header field in the response MUST equal the URI in the To header field;
additionally, the UAS MUST add a tag to the To header field in the
response (with the exception of the 100 (Trying) response, in which a
tag MAY be present).  This serves to identify the UAS that is
responding, possibly resulting in a component of a dialog ID."

My question is: is there a reason why a final error response to an
initial INVITE, for which NO provisional responses have been sent (ie no
dialog has been established), must contain a To tag?

Regards,

Christer
---------------------------------------

I was not able to find answers to this query.


Regards,
Sunil

That is a somewhat different question. The easy answer to this (and many
other seemingly obscure parts of SIP) is related to forking. Without
to-tags it is hard to distinguish retransmissions from responses to
forked requests. Most of the time it doesn't matter, but when debugging
a network, it can be useful. Perhaps someone else can offer more examples...

Section 17.1.3 discusses much the same problem in relation to multicast,
if you are interested.

The simple answer to your question is: you must include the to-tag to 
conform to 3261.

I think the question you are really asking is: "will the UAC and 
intervening proxies do the right thing if the to-tag is not present in 
the response?"

The answer to that is "probably". RFC 2543 didn't have to/from tags. So 
if the UAC calls a UAS that only conforms to 2543 then it will get this 
situation. So any element that attempts to be 2543 compatible will deal 
with this. And, as you seem to have figured out, the tag doesn't 
contribute any information that is essential to properly processing the 
response. So, if you want to take the risk, you can try omitting the 
to-tag in this case. But you may encounter problems, or be branded as 
non-conforming. If it comes to finger pointing on this, you will lose. 
So why not just put the to-tag in? You need the logic in  most other 
cases anyway, so it seems like extra work to leave it out in this case.

Perhaps I'm being misled by the subject line. I thought this discussion 
arose from the DERIVE work -- for which "what a UA *should* do" is 
highly irrelevant. The only thing that matters for DERIVE is "what 
deployed UAs *actually* do." And given that *we* don't even know the 
answer to the *first* question, I would put my money on betting the 
answer to the second one is all over the map.


But, if we're having the argument...

I agree with Paul, with one minor revision: I would change the final 
clause of his final sentence to "...so adding another seems like a 
really, really bad idea."

It might be a bit of a stretched analogy, but in this particular  =

situation:
The response to the subscribe definitely talks about the subscription  =

usage (its the envelope)
Information about the pointed-to dialog ending is carried in NOTIFYs  =

(its the stuff in the envelope)

I'd like to point out that we've already taken the first steps of 
actually breaking 2543 compatibility with RFC 4916. I would not be 
surprised if we take further steps away from 2543 compatibility in the 
future.

In other words: I would be very cautious in relying on *any* 2543 
backwards-compatibility mechanisms.

That doesn't change the answer above though.
The response to the subscribe is about the subscription-usage being  =

gone.
That might be the case because all the dialogs being subscribed to are  =

gone, but the error doesn't tell you that.

Further, when those dialogs went away, NOTIFYs would have been  =

generated.
The only case where you wouldn't have that information before your  =

resubscribed failed is if
the NOTIFYs and the reSUBSCRIBE crossed on the wire.

I guess I might be dense, but why can't that be derived from the HI
entry just before the one marked as the "target" entry?  This was the
whole concept behind capturing complete history info - you should always
have the previous request URI and you can build a complete tree of the
retargeting (where RFC 4244 defined that term to include both basic
routing changes to the request URI as well as redirections).

Also, I don't think it's appropriate that it would even be defined in
this doc, even if you need it. You would need a separate doc in SIPPING
and go through the normal expert review process.

Mary.

P-Called-Party-ID


 
Hi,

The draft-holmberg-sip-target-uri-delivery-01.txt draft contained text
on why the P-Called-Party-ID header was used. Would it be a good idea to
keep that text in this spec, because I have already received questions
regarding that.

Regards,

Christer

Actually, I think what you see in the call flow is not the last leg, but the one
before (i.e. to OB-B).

I would suggest that Jonathan adds the last leg to <b>, including the
Request-URI being replaced by the registered contact.

Section 3 opens with the following text:

>    In this section, "UAC" is the User Agent Client from the perspective
>    of the INVITE method.  That is, it is the User Agent (UA) that sends
>    the initial INVITE method request.  This may be somewhat confusing if

Yes, this is very confusing, and contrary to any other use anywhere 
else. I would suggest using terms like "Calling UA" and "Called UA," 
lest we make an already confusing issue even more muddy.

Hi Mary,

I am not sure I understand what you are saying.

I am not asking to "define" anything. I am just asking to include the text =
which says why P-CPI can NOT be used.

Regards,

Christer

I guess I might be dense, but why can't that be derived from the HI
entry just before the one marked as the "target" entry?  This was the
whole concept behind capturing complete history info - you should always
have the previous request URI and you can build a complete tree of the
retargeting (where RFC 4244 defined that term to include both basic
routing changes to the request URI as well as redirections).

Also, I don't think it's appropriate that it would even be defined in
this doc, even if you need it. You would need a separate doc in SIPPING
and go through the normal expert review process.

Mary. =

Hi,

The draft-holmberg-sip-target-uri-delivery-01.txt draft contained text
on why the P-Called-Party-ID header was used. Would it be a good idea to
keep that text in this spec, because I have already received questions
regarding that.

Of course people are trying to make it work for E.164 -- that's the 
entire point of draft-wing-sip-e164-rrc.

However, E.164 addresses that correspond to PSTN destinations pose their 
own set of challenges that are similar to the issues I discuss below in 
the "SIP and Return Routability of AORs" section. Most of these have to 
do with the availability of multiple routes to the PSTN -- factor in 
least-cost-routing logic and "carrier enum" deployments, and the chances 
of routing back to the the exact same domain as the PSTN ingress appear 
to become vanishingly small.

This highlights a point that I think is critically important -- there is 
a huge, flashing, 
jumping-up-and-down-naked-painted-safety-orange-from-head-to-toe-with-strobes-and-klaxons-strapped-to-your-head 
difference between doing this kind of thing for E.164 numbers that 
ultimately resolve to PSTN destinations, and doing this kind of thing 
for E.164 numbers that ultimately resolve to IP destinations without 
ever traversing the PSTN. In the latter case, dial-back mechanisms work 
as well as they do with SIP addressing. In the former, I think the best 
we can hope for, in terms of dial-back, is failure (due to the factors I 
describe above). Which one were you asking about?

Sorry, I misunderstood your point - your email suggests to add text about w=
hy P-Called-Party-ID was used (and didn't say "NOT used"). It's also not cl=
ear in your previous doc as you mention that 3GPP will continue to use the =
P-Called-Party-ID. =


Either way, I still don't think we should discuss p-headers in a standard's=
 track document. I think Jonathan has put forth reasonable use cases that s=
how why the solution in this document works and in general, I don't think w=
e need to consider P-headers to solve general problems. =


ISTM you might want a 3GPP specific doc describing why this document is pre=
ferred over a solution that uses P-Called-Party-ID.

(as WG chair)

A warning that the standard boilerplate will change on internet drafts
shortly. See attached message.

Those of you that use xml2rfc from the server pages to create your
documents should have no problem (although you will be making a slightly
different legal commitment). Those of you (JAMES!) who insist on using
more diverse means of creating your internet-drafts will have to take
more trouble.

Keith

Greetings.  This message is to draw your attention to the significance
of the publication of RFC5377 and RFC5378 earlier today. =20
=20
* RFC5377 is Advice to the Trustees of the IETF Trust on Rights to Be
Granted in IETF Documents
* RFC5378 is Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust
=20
Note that RFC5378 is also BCP0078.  RFC5378 is an update to RFC2026, and
RFC5378 obsoletes both RFC3978 and RFC4748.=20
=20
Coincident with the above, the IETF Trustees have posted a new policy
document with guidance to the community on:
* Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents at
http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/
=20
Taken as a set, the documents listed above specify changes that are now
required in all new submissions into the IETF.

Henrik Levkowetz has updated the idnit tool and AMS have updated the
Internet-Draft submission tool to reflect the new requirements.  An
update to the xml2rfc has been requested.=20
=20
Please review the "Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents" and
RFC5378 to discover the new boilerplate text that is now required.
Please also take action to update the tools you use for creating your
documents.

New submissions using either the old or the new boilerplate text will be
accepted starting today, until 01h00 UTC on December 16th, 2008.  After
this cutoff date, all new submissions will be required to use ONLY the
new boilerplate text.  All submissions using old boilerplate text after
the cutoff date will be rejected.

Regards and FYI.

S 4.1 reads:

   NOTE: When using SRTP [RFC3261], the secure media stream is bound to
   the crypto context setup for the dialog, and can be identified using
   the MKI of SRTP.

Unless I've misunderstood 3711, MKI is optional, so this may not
be true.

Hi Mary, =


>Sorry, I misunderstood your point - your email suggests to add text about =
why P-Called-Party-ID was used (and didn't say =

>"NOT used").

Ok, sorry for that.

>It's also not clear in your previous doc as you mention that 3GPP will con=
tinue to use the P-Called-Party-ID. =


Yes, but that doesn't prevent them from using the H-I mechanism, should the=
re be a requirement for that.

P-CPI is used for another purpose than the problem we are trying to solve.

I don't see a reason why we can't indicate why a specific mechanism can not=
 be used. That is part of the justification of the new H-I mechanism.

>ISTM you might want a 3GPP specific doc describing why this document is pr=
eferred over a solution that uses P-Called-

Again, P-CPI cannot be used :)

Christer

I guess I might be dense, but why can't that be derived from the HI entry j=
ust before the one marked as the "target" entry?  This was the whole concep=
t behind capturing complete history info - you should always have the previ=
ous request URI and you can build a complete tree of the retargeting (where=
 RFC 4244 defined that term to include both basic routing changes to the re=
quest URI as well as redirections).

Also, I don't think it's appropriate that it would even be defined in this =
doc, even if you need it. You would need a separate doc in SIPPING and go t=
hrough the normal expert review process.

   I'd like to point out that we've already taken the first steps of 
   actually breaking 2543 compatibility with RFC 4916.  [...]

If the question is "When I generate a non-2xx response, am I required
to add a to-tag?", the answer is "Yes."

If the question is "When I receive a non-2xx response, is it required
to have a to-tag?", the answer is "No."

Hi,

Ok. So, maybe we could say "using the MKI (if used) of SRTP".

Hi Adam,

thank you very much  -- that's been most helpful indeed and I agree
with pretty much all the points. I would highlight the scope and
the actual verification mechanisms.

I think that the scope, better-than-nothing, which just works with
the same infrastructure, as for INVITE delivery, and makes on
particular trust assumptions, begins to be agreeable.

I agree too the actual verification mechanism, is difficult to agree
upon. For now,I would resort to listing how such can differ from each
other:
- it it E2E (i.e., without any support in the network)
   -- that's obviously the objective
- does it work with existing UA implementations, at least with
   some? That's desirable, not sure if really feasible.
- if it leans on some existing SIP extensions, are these specified
   in a way that the scenario can unambiguously lean upon? (unfortunately
   not the case with dialog package)
- does it work for requests that don't establish dialogs (preferably
   yes)
- can it deal with forking?

So far I have heard further suggestions for using some combination of
OPTIONS, dialog authorization, or even a new method -- but we haven't
really yet tested those hard.

Also the applicability is a key  aspect -- reverse routability
agreeably being the most important one (apart from latency, security
assumptions such as uncompromised DNS). I think the general
approach is to explain that positive assertions are useful, negative
don't give much, and document examples of when it fails, possibly
accompanied by remedy suggestions:
- unregistered UAC, UAC with call forwarding, anonymous UAC: don't do it :)
   (possibly offer to retry)
- B2BUA: if you break it you fix it
- tel URI .... perhaps resolving to IP if possible?
- shared URI ....
- UAC's proxy forwarding SUBSCRIBEs somewhere else...
- 3pcc...

-jiri

[JRE] This is a pointless exercise if it can't be deployed without
fixing SIP intermediaries that are out there at present, and many of
these are B2BUAs. This is similar reasoning to that which says that it
has to work with the majority of UAs out there at present. There has to
be a good chance of the mechanism working in the majority of
inter-domain situations, and sadly that will nearly always involve
B2BUAs of some form, and sadly this means a lot of things in SIP
messages get changed. We can't do much about B2BUAs that are
deliberately trying to stop things working, but we should at least try
to take account of B2BUAs that are going about their legitimate
business. Otherwise this will be yet another SIP RFC that never or
rarely gets deployed.

I don't have a problem with this, but honestly I don't think this 
note is that necessary, since you have the problem with ordinary
RTP and SRTP doesn't always solve it, why say anything at all?

The purpose of the note is not to say that this always solves this. But,
people requested an example where it does solve it.

I DO think we should have a more genric correlate-media-with-dialog
mechanism, but that is outside the scope of the 199 document.

Regards,

Christer

As you saw on the IETF list, we'll be conducting an experiment of  
using RFID cards to identify speakers at the microphone during the SIP  
and SIPPING WG meetings, based on a prototype developed by a project  
student in my lab, Athar Shiraz Siddiqui. Speaker names and  
affiliations will be announced to the Jabber chat room. We only have  
50 cards this time around, so please let Athar, cc'ed, know if you'd  
like to participate and we'll make a you badge. We'll add all authors  
of drafts on the agenda automatically, so you only need to respond if  
you intend to come to the microphone, but are not on the agenda.

Thanks for your help.

Henning

I like this draft. It's exactly what I had in mind.

One comment however.

The name "target" is defined by this spec as a new History-Info parameter. However, the name 
"target" is also used by RFC 4458 as a SIP/SIP URI parameter.

Now, as described in RFC 4458, History-Info may capture the SIP URIs (including that parameter),
so you would endup with the term "target" twice (for different meanings) in the same History-Info,
which could be confusing.

Taking the example in 6.4/RFC 4458 for example, and adjusting it for draft-rosenberg-sip-target-uri-delivery would result in this:

    History-Info: <sip:+15555551002@example.com;user=phone >;index=1;target,
                  <sip:line1@192.0.2.4?Reason=SIP%3Bcause%3D302;\
                   text="Moved Temporarily">;index=1.1
                  <sip: voicemail@example.com;\
                   target=sip:+15555551002%40example.com;user=phone;\
                   cause=486>;index=2;target

Now, it's parsable, but slightly confusing to have both a URI parameter and a History-Infor header 
parameter that are the same in the same history header. That would argue for a different name. (And the target in RFC 4458 is the previous target as opposed to the current target).

However...

There is another possibility. Jonathan's draft actually make the "target" URI parameter in 4458 redundant. The only thing that remains useful from 4458 is then the "cause" URI parameter.

So, we could obsolete the draft (or at least just the taget parameter in 4458). The History-Info 
heade in the previous example would look like this:

    History-Info: <sip:+15555551002@example.com;user=phone >;index=1;target,
                  <sip:line1@192.0.2.4?Reason=SIP%3Bcause%3D302;\
                   text="Moved Temporarily">;index=1.1
                  <sip: voicemail@example.com>;index=2;target

Actually I removed the 800 use case because it doesn't work so well with 
the proposed mechanism. The reason is that, this draft is very crisp 
about how you determine if a URI is a 'target' or not - based on a 
REGISTRATION. However, for 8xx numbers, my assumption is that they would 
typically be translated to a non-8xx number by some other configured 
translation on the server, not via a registration.

For example, a server might have a config like this:

1-800-555-1212:
   replace with: directory@example.com

and then individual UAs register as 'directory'.

In reality this was a problem in the UA loose route draft too; its 
really hard to programatically determine that something is a target vs. 
not a target.

Added. However, I must say I remain confused about handling of loose 
routes and H-I. In my example, the request will go from H-B to OB-B due 
to a route learned via a Path header field in a REGISTER. As such, that 
request should also contain a Route header pointing to OB-B. What would 
H-I look like in that case?

If the request-URI doesn't change, then there is no H-I entry added. 

Or am I missing your question?

The following note is in section 4.3.3.1 in RFC 4244 wrt loose routing:
   "Note that in
   the case of loose routing, the Request-URI does not change during the
   forwarding of a Request; thus, the capturing of History-Info for such
   a request would result in duplicate Request-URIs with different
   indices. "

So, basically, if you do loose routing, you don't get much value with
H-I, but there is no change in behavior for capturing H-I entries in the
case of loose routing -i.e. H-I doesn't look to see that you're doing
loose routing and not capture entries.

Hi Jonathan;

  I think when I was reading conditions in section 5.1,I understood
that  it meant if one of the condition is met "target" would be
added, which would have left room for 800 use cases based on
static configuration as you mentioned below.

  But I really don't see how it would differ whether the mapping is
configured through REGISTRATION or not.

  For example the mapping below can be configured through
registration(UA registering to directory and directory registering
to 1-800 number), in which case it will result in 2 H-I entry with
"target" parameters according to the specification(If both proxies
that does the translation supports this specification)...

  I guess I don't really see the reason why the text has to be so
restrictive.

  Regards
   Shida

Let's steal a pagebook from the PSTN, circa the early 1990's, when
disable-echo-cancellation tones were introduced.  As everyone probably
remembers, they were necessary for the >9600bps modems and fax machines.  At
the time, no PSTN equipment understood the disable tones so nobody could use
their fancy 14.4kbps modem at 14.4kbps.  But as time went on more PSTN
equipment understood the disable tones and eventually you could almost always
get a >9600bps speed connection.  It did not happen overnight, and did not
happen immediately.  People that bought the faster modems were often unhappy
they could not use the faster speed.  But the specification was written,
intermediaries (Service Providers) agreed it caused them no harm, eventually
the intermediary equipment understood the disable-echo-cancellation tones.
Briefly, world hunger was solved.

If that situation doesn't ring with some familiarity, there are many other
situations where where intermediaries had to upgrade in order for the end user
to benefit:  unleaded gasoline; airport runways long enough for passenger
jets.  I'm sure more creative people can think of other situations where this
worked well.  Obviously there are zillions of counter examples as well (e.g.,
hydrogen powered cars are not viable due to insufficient numbers and poor
distribution of hydrogen fueling stations; supersonic flight over continents
is not viable because the people living on the continent do not generally
enjoy the supersonic boom).

$Id: draft-ietf-sip-saml-05-rev.txt,v 1.1 2008/11/15 02:58:38 ekr Exp $

The purpose of this document seems to be to allow the use of SAML
authentication for SIP messages. However, after reading it, I find
myself fairly confused about how it works and what security properties
are provided. 

MAJOR TECHNICAL
1. Unless I'm misreading S 7, unlike RFC 4474, no signature covers the
message. Rather, the signature covers the SAML assertion which has
some not very well specified relationship to the message (See S
7.1.5). This seems like the foundation for a cut-and-paste attack. S
10.1 dismisses this risk, but I don't see why. Where does, for
instance, the SDP get checked?  What stops me from stealing an
assertion and setting up a call impersonating the caller?

2. I don't understand how the verifier obtains the domain cert
of the signer. Reading 7.1.5, it sounds like I'm supposed
to extract it from ds:X509Certificate, but if the assertion is
fetched by reference over TLS, then I would wnat to verify the certificate
before I see the the asssertion So I don't see how this works.
How does this work with unsigned assertions fetched over TLS?

3. Aren't the storage requirements different for thsi mechanism than
for RFC 4474? With 4474, you basically just have one cert that you
hand out all the time. But in this draft, you might generate a new
assertion for each call. How do you garbage collect them?



MAJOR EDITORIAL
Editorially, the mechanisms are scattered throughout the document
without a single, unified statement of how things are intended to
work. This is made worse by the fact that a lot of the document is
just profiling SAML or 4474 without explaining what's being profiled.
For instance:

   The SAML assertion MAY contain an <AttributeStatement> element.  If
   so, the <AttributeStatement> element will contain attribute-value
   pairs, e.g., of a user profile nature, encoded according to either
   one of the "SAML Attribute Profiles" as specified in
   [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os], or encoded in some implementation-
   and/or deployment-specific attribute profile.

What's an AttributeStatement? I mean, I can guess, but what is
this for. This isn't helped by the fact that 7.1.5 is fairly
vague about what you do with the assertion (steps 7-11 are
phrased as "this may include the following checks"), which
makes it quite hard to reverse engineer what's intended.

In addition, the document would benefit from a clear statement
of what the security properties it's intended to provide and
which pieces of the system are responsible for providing 
each piece.


DETAILED COMMENTS
7.1.3.3.
      Step 1 of [RFC4474] Section 6 maps to and is updated by, the
      following two steps in this procedure.

Which next two steps? This is really unclear. Can you please provide
a unified description of how verification is done without having
to reference individual substeps of 4474. 


7.1.4.1.3.
What is the audience restriction bringing to the party here? what
security properties does it provide?

What is the impact of clock skew in this spec?


7.1.5.
   6.   Verify that the content of the SAML assertion matches with the
        information carried in the SIP message.  This may include the
        following checks:

This seems unacceptably vague for implementors. How do I know what
to do?


   9.   Verify that the SAML assertion's <SubjectConfirmation> element
        value is set to whichever value was configured at
        implementation- or deployment-time.  The default value is:

           urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:sender-vouches

What does this do?

8.1.
   Section 3.7.5.3 Security Considerations:

      Support for TLS 1.0 or SSL 3.0 is mandatory to implement.

This implies a normative ref to TLS 1.0 and HTTPS [neither
of which appears in the references] and SSL 3.0, which isn't
an IETF protocol. Also, shouldn't this be TLS 1.1 at this point?

9.
   51       "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress">
   52         Alice@example.com
   53       </NameID>


Wait, aren't you comparing an email address value to a SIP URI?
That seems problematic.

Our first session is Monday 17:40 - 19:30

If you are presenting at this session, can we have the slides you will
be presenting by 11:30 am Monday at the absolute latest.

Our second session is Thursday 13:00 - 15:00

If you are presenting at this session, can we have the slides you will
be presenting by 9:00 am Thursday at the absolute latest.

Dean has his rubber chicken at the ready.

If anyone has material (one slide max) they think should be appearing in
the agenda slides, e.g. special mentions of drafts, etc, can we have
these by 9:00 am Monday at the latest.

regards

Keith

I believe the 800 use case is still a valid problem that has to be
solved.

Do we have another way of using History-Info that would cover this
specific case. For example, do we just need an extension to the
Voicemail URI RFC?

Hi!

How would the TDM interworking work?
Look at 'Figure 1: Overview of Operation' and assume this:

- Call SIP->PSTN

The callee is in the PSTN/TDM world and proxy 2 acts as
a gateway.
In this case the callee would never send a SUBSCRIBE.
If there is no authentication/authorization for the call
the gateway may opt to subscribe to the user?

- Call PSTN->SIP

The caller is on the TDM side and proxy 1 acts as a PSTN to SIP
gateway. The callee sends the SUBSCRIBE which ends up at
the edge on proxy 1.
What should the proxy do?
a) Respond on behalf of the caller
b) do not support the Dialog event package and respond
    with 489 to the SUBSCRIBE
c) do some magic based on information conveyed on the
    TDM side?

Cheers,
  Hendrik

Although only targeted at an Experimental RFC, I think it requires more
work.
In particular, relationship to RFC 4474 is unclear:

- "Step 3.  AS Authorizes the SIP Request and Forwards it to Callee

            First, the AS authorizes the received INVITE message as
            specified in [RFC4474] and [RFC3261]."
But it then goes on to say nothing more about AS RFC 4474 behaviour.
Presumably it goes on and signs the request and inserts Identity and
Identity-Info header fields, but this is not explicit.

- "Step 4.  Callee Dereferences HTTP-based SAML URI Reference

            Bob's UAC or SIP Proxy receives the message and begins
            verifying it per the "Verifier Behavior" specified in
            [RFC4474]."
What exactly is meant by "begins verifying"?

And then the more detailed description in section 7:
- "This first portion of this step maps to Steps 3 and 4 of Section 5
   "Authentication Service Behavior" of [RFC4474], which the AS MUST
   perform, although with the following additional substeps:"
But what about steps 1 and 2?

"Steps 2, 3, and 4 of [RFC4474] Section 6 may be mapped across this
      latter portion of this step, and/or the following two steps, as
      appropriate."
What exactly does "mapped across" mean? I think it needs slightly more
explanation.

The role of the Identity-Info header field and how it relates to
SAML-Info are not mentioned.

An example showing SIP message contents would be useful.

The SAML-Info header field is not signed as part of the Identity
signature. Some discussion in Security Considerations as to why this is
not a problem might be appropriate.

Just a question. Is it usual to register values with IANA in an
Experimental RFC?

Response codes 477, 478 and 479 are included in the IANA section, but
only 479 is mentioned earlier in the document.

Section 7.2 seems to be incomplete, because it fails to say how the
assertion is conveyed in a SIP message.

BTW, I forgot to mention in my comments, but I agree with this assessment.

No, I think we'd need to allow for configuration to be a valid use case 
for addition of the target parameter as well. Shida makes a fine point 
and there is no reason to exclude it.

Henning,

This is a great idea and I look forward to participating. Can you let 
everyone know, how will we obtain the RFID badges? Do we need to look 
for you and/or Athar or is there a desk set up somewhere to pick them up?

Good idea. I was trying to capture the UAC/UAS from the INFO  
perspective, but one of the source documents focused on UAC/UAS from  
the INVITE perspective. This is a great resolution. Thanks!

(As WG chair)

A long while back there was some interest in getting this chartered as a
SIP WG item.

We have been having a long and delayed thread external to the list on
this which may be summarised as:

-	the AD wants evidence of a clear use case

-	the security adviser to the SIP WG not seeing that there is a
use case.

-	the authors having so far failed to convince either.

I attach the two key mails that relate to the technical discussion and
you can scroll down and see the rest of the thread.

I invite other members of the SIP WG to add further input to this
discussion.

regards

Keith

You are correct in that the UAC does not know whether P2 is a proxy with
which it shares a key or not! This allows for two kinds of attacks:

=3D Impersonation: A rogue proxy responds as though it is a valid proxy
that should be responding to the UAC. Such a proxy may not challenge the
request (and the UAC will not know). Or it may challenge the UAC to
obtain enough challenge response information to launch say a dictionary
attack (again the UAC will not know).=20

=3D MITM: Which you describe, and you are right, the UAC would not know.
However, this MiM may be 'passive' or 'active'. In the case of the
latter, it can modify the header or the body to cause undesirable
behavior even when the two endpoints are 'valid'.

The Proxy-Authentication-Info header mitigates some of these issues.
Specifically, it limits a rogue proxy from launching an impersonation
attack (non-MITM) and get away with a fake challenge. It also provides
for limited integrity protection over the response to limit active
modification of (parts of) the response in the case of an active MITM
attack.

I will respond to 2 and 3 together. In #3 you hit on a good point, which
is that the mechanism proposed does not allow a UAC to challenge P2. (Is
there a way to do it in SIP?). Assuming that there are no mechanisms for
the client to challenge the proxy:
- the UAC can be configured (say, in PacketCable) to expect a challenge
for a request, and to verify that this challenge response allows for
mutual authentication. If there is no challenge, or mutual
authentication is unsuccessful, the UAC retries.
 - the proxy is similarly configured, i.e., it challenges the requests
and ensures mutual authentication in the response.

The above allows a client to - indirectly - challenge a proxy that
accepts its request, mitigating part of the security threats. Apart from
security reasons, it also allows for efficiency (e.g., next-nonce).=20

This is similar to the Authentication-Info header in RFC3261, except
that it is not being presented as an optional header.=20

[I am also curious as to why the Authentication-Info header presents a
significant advantage for UAC-Registrar over Proxy-Authentication-Info
header for UAC-Proxy]?

Hi Keith,

So, I reread the document and went to write a review explaining my
concerns with it, only to find that I have an existing review of=20
of the current (-03) version in my reviews directory.

To recap, I don't see an interesting attack that this mechanism
prevents. An attacker can generally insert themselves in the of the
signalling channel and as long as they remain invisible vis-a-vis the
SIP routing headers seen by the end-host, they can simply proxy any
challenge/response interactions that the user attempts to use to
validate correctness. This is easily sufficient to mount passive
observation attacks on the signalling and is also sufficient to
mount active attacks as long as those particular messages aren't
subject to Digest Auth (and as far as I know, nobody expects
all messages to be so subject, as this would be very inefficient).

Rereading Sumanth's response from 7/31, I don't see that it=20
describes any particularly compelling use cases either, so my
opinion remains that this is a solution looking for a problem.
As a practical matter, this style of initial cryptographic
authentication followed by cleartext messaging only really works
well either as (1) an imperfect access control mechanism or (2) in
environments where the channel over which the signalling is
being sent is secured (TLS in the case of SIP). However, neither
situation applies here.

Accordingly, IMO this document shouldn't be chartered until it
comes with a much more compelling security rationale. If, in
future, a rationale is provided that you find convincing, I'll
be happy to rereview the document in that light at that time.

Omer and I will distribute the RFID cards to those who registered for  
this trial at the chair's desk in Salon D during the break before the  
SIP session on Monday.

Thanks,

Hi Dan and John,

I actually do have a counter-example which makes me a bit worried -- NATs.
(not meaning to disagree ... just trying to understand the evolution cycle)
Think of IP addresses in application payload with NATs. That appears 
remarkably
similar as reference to a call in SUB/NOT in DERIVE, which -- if not 
translated
by the B2BUA that translates it in callid/to/from header-field -- will fail.
Obviously ignoring NATs didn't work quite well.

I would tend to be pragmatic and like to make DERIVE B2BUA-resilient, I'm
just failing to see how. If a UA can be smart and robust enough to deal
with strange things in the network, why don't we do that. The problem is
really I don't see a clear way of doing that. To my best knowledge, there
is not a single piece of SIP message which a B2BUA would guarantee to
deliver to the other party. The notion of B2BUA is largely unspecified
in its behaviour.

We could try to guess a behaviour of a "resonable B2BUA". For example we
could assume that if we don't put dialog references in payload (e.g. by 
using
an in-dialog new-method IS-IT-YOU request), the dialog reference will be
translated like for the initial INVITE and things will work.

So in summary these are IMO the options to deal with it:
a) ignore B2BUA traversal in anticipation if they break something,
    they will be motivate to fix it
b) align the design to something we guess has a better chance
    to get through B2BUAs without a normative reliance on their
    behaviour (but what could it be???)
c) in addition to a/ or b/, do B2BUA-BEHAVE :)


Aside from architectural and evolution arguments on both a and b, does 
anyone
have an opinion on what can safely get through the B2BUAs?

I like it.

>> But can somebody remind me why we need Send-Info at all?

You may be willing to send a package but not be willing to receive a  
package.  For example, you may be a phone that wants to send only the  
DTMF package but have no need to receive any INFOs. You need a way to  
advertise what you are willing to send.

In much older drafts, when it was really an offer/answer handshake,  
there was some thought you might modify what you will advertise. For  
example, if you advertised
    Send-Info: old-foo, new-foo
and the response had
    Recv-Info: old-foo, new-foo
the final response may just list
    Send-Info: new-foo
to let the UAS know you will only be sending new-foo.

I am ambivalent about this.  What say you?

Agreed.

Yes, and I would offer sending Send-Info/Recv-Info in every  
(potential) state changing message means the protocol works in all  
scenarios. It doesn't cost much in bytes, but I can see the argument  
that if you ran a separate, light-weight keep-alive mechanism, it  
would need to now know about INFO Packages.

Sounds good to me.  I used render because its meaning is well-known  
("Do something with it").

Will do.

Nope. I'll fix.

Yup.

The intention of the existing words is, in fact, case-sensitive.   
Again, I can go either way.

This is what I've gleaned from the list:

=95SIP Option Tags? E.g., sip.extension

=95Wording clarifications from Arun Arunachalam, John Elwell, Adam Roach

=95What to do with subsequent requests with no send/recv-info?
=96Use existing set? Saves bytes; session timer code can be =
INFO-ignorant
=96Cancel existing set? Burns bytes, but always works (i.e., 3pcc)

=95Allow Contact: in INFO? Probably not.

=95send/recv-info headers in INFO? Probably not.

=95Case sensitivity in INFO Package names?

Anything else?=

Keith,

Thanks for resurfacing this, it has been a while! To refresh the group's
memory the origin of the I-D was the need to allow a UA to mutually
authenticate with proxies other than the next-hop
(UA<->Proxies<->Proxy). For authenticating with the next-hop proxy, TLS
should be used (as acknowledged in the I-D). The earlier versions (-01
and -02) raised more questions than answers! With -03 there seemed to be
a few interested people within this WG (and outside) who saw value in
this I-D (e.g., Scott Lawrence, Milan Patel, Christer Holmberg, Martin
Dolly, Francois Audet; see emails from around July '08). It would be
nice to get their feedback once again on the need (or not) for this
requirement (independent of the I-D). If we still see a need for this
requirement, I would solicit suggestions to revise the I-D to clearly
articulate the requirement and the potential solution(s).

Additionally, I had offline discussions (in Ireland) with one of the ADs
(Cullen) who saw value in (or at least did not dismiss) this I-D; unless
I misunderstood the conversation. We left the conversation with a plan
to discuss further with the security adviser. Did we miss any further
communication (from the ADs)?

Ekr, 

Thanks for your response. To clarify, perhaps the I-D is not the answer
to the requirement we are trying to solve, in which case we need to look
at other alternatives (or surface other I-Ds). I (personally) would not
like the I-D to be the holdup for us to solve the need (stated above).

I have a few follow-up responses to your comments. When you say
"cryptographic authentication followed by clear text messaging", I am
hoping that you are not dismissing subsequent challenges. For example,
if there is a UA request which is deemed sensitive, the proxy should
challenge it. To ensure that an 'impersonator' cannot get away without a
challenge, the UA can be configured to discontinue further messaging in
the absence of a challenge (this is because we don't have a mechanism
for the UA to challenge the proxy, unless I am mistaken). This may not
prevent a passive attack, but would it not thwart an active attack? If
not, given the limited integrity protection offered by the header,
should we extend the requirements to provide better integrity
protection? Is that an option?

In response to your second point about the non-applicability of secure
signaling, the I-D allows for the UA to mutually authenticate with
multiple non-next-hop proxies, each of which can share unique
credentials with the UA. This model works even in the presence of TLS.
Why is this not applicable, or am I missing the point (sorry, it has
been a while since we discussed this issue)? 

Thanks!

- S

(As WG chair)

A long while back there was some interest in getting this chartered as a
SIP WG item.

We have been having a long and delayed thread external to the list on
this which may be summarised as:

-	the AD wants evidence of a clear use case

-	the security adviser to the SIP WG not seeing that there is a
use case.

-	the authors having so far failed to convince either.

I attach the two key mails that relate to the technical discussion and
you can scroll down and see the rest of the thread.

I invite other members of the SIP WG to add further input to this
discussion.

regards

Keith

RTP, after the call is set up.  Everything else is problematic 
to varying degrees.

If SBC vendors and SP see it is possible to provide (some sort
of) "identity", while still preserving the reasons they deploy
SBCs, they will do it.  Especially when spammers start stealing
identities and reducing the effectiveness of whitelists beause
of those stolen identities.

General comments:

* I really dislike how the meaning of UAC/UAS has been changed from
RFC3261. This is really confusing and I think complicates presentation
of the material

* I think the negotiation of supported types is not sufficiently well
defined. We're going to run into many of the hard cases we ran into for
offer/answer - so lets address them now. What happens if, in an early
dialog, there is a reverse UPDATE that changes the send/recv packages,
and then a 2xx to the INVITE arrives with a different set? Which takes
priority? What about mid-dialog exchanges that are rejected, do we
revert back to the previous set? Indeed I don't think we should model 
this on O/A at all.

* The draft allows for multiple packages to be in a single INFO. Egads,
that just complicates life. Multipart support is already a mess in SIP.
Do we REALLY need this? Cant you just send two INFO requests? If a
single INFO has a single package, we also don't need the cid mechanism.
Less is more (I know this had some discussion already on the list...)

* I don't like the behavior whereby, if a UA receives an INFO with an
unknownn package, we terminate the dialog. Why so extreme?


* I know we've discussed this one, but I disagree that the event
packages HAVE to be specification required. I think we should allow for
vendor prorpietary usage. My suggestion is to define a vendor tree for
info event packages.


* Section 7.1 includes some of the considerations in the info-litmus 
draft, but only some. We should either fold it all in or else split it 
all out. In either way, its really important to separately consider the 
question on whether the exchange should take place in the signaling vs. 
media path, and then if signaling, whether to use INFO, event pakcage, 
or new method, etc.


Specific comments:



> The purpose of

>    application level information along the SIP signaling path.

There is no clear definition here of 'application'. I think that merits
some discussion.

>  Info Package negotiation is an offer/offer mechanism.  The UAC may
>    offer a set of Send-Info and Recv-Info packages in the initial
>    INVITE, the UAS offers its set of Send-Info and Recv-Info pacakges in

I think its a bad idea to use the term 'offer/offer' since it sounds
like this is related to the SDP offer/answer mechanism. Suggest the word
'propose' instead of offer.

> In this section, "UAC" is the User Agent Client from the perspective
>    of the INVITE method.  That is, it is the User Agent (UA) that sends

This contradicts the definition in rfc3261; the role of UAC and UAS are
on a per-transaction basis, not fixed for the duration of the call based
on the initiate INVITE that established the session!

what if the previous exchange omitted Send-Info or Recv-Info, but an
exchange prior had contained it?

not just at establishment, but at any time.

this is very vague in terms of what it means.

In which case, this should be defined more generically rather than
writing it in terms of INVITE and just say, 'oh, it works in other use
cases too'

We should clearly enumerate what this is. Can we update Contacts? Is
INFO a target refresh request? What about P-A-ID? Or From/To URI?

I think you should make this a SHOULD (inclusion of Send/Recv Info).

hmm, why? This complicates things. KISS.

You should show an example of what the actual table in the IANA registry 
looks like and include the 'nil' there.

I disagree with this statement. There are new considerations here - 
we're now exchanging APPLICATION data in SIP, and this increases 
sensitivity of the data depending on the application. For example 
considering using INFO to send typical form-data, like a credit card 
number....

there is no need to make rfc-ed do this work. Write the document to
reflect what it is meant to look like as an RFC.

this repeats already-defined behavior in rfc3261. Remove.

'have relied on..." you don't say what they've relied on these FOR.

I think this should be rate of INFOs

There seems to be some confusion between media feature tags, as used  =

in RFV 3840/3841, and SIP option tags.

Option tags are used in Supported and Require, with a common  =

application being in Supported header fields sent in response to  =

OPTIONS messages. They describe which extensions are supported by the  =

UA. I think we need one for INFO packages, because INFO package  =

negotiation is clearly an extension to base INFO.


Feature tags, on the other hand, support selective retargeting in  =

proxies where the potential targets are discovered via REGISTER  =

operations. We may need this too.

Maybe. Sometime they transcode, which can mess things up.

I'd be okay with this.

Because an SIP request can carry AIB or e2m (or other such extension,  
like SAML assertions)) body parts, there is the possibility that an  
INFO might also get such attachments. We can't stop this without  
deprecating the behavior of those specifications. We must therefore be  
prepared to determine which body part(s) is(are) associated with the  
INFO package, and which are something else.

Can we do this based only on the MIME body type?  Yes, in the cases we  
know about so far. Do we have a way to assure this given the  
probability of future specs

And I assure you, the IESG will notice this weakness. We do need to  
beef this discussion up.

Buried in here is a discussion with OPTIONS.
=20
I believe OPTIONS is useful, but I could live without it. If we have it,
it should do what OPTIONS always does, i.e. provide a means of
discovering what would happen if I tried an INVITE request with the same
characteristics.
=20
That means we have to agree what the parameters in an INVITE dialog
provide us with first.

	I like it.


			But can somebody remind me why we need Send-Info
at all?


	You may be willing to send a package but not be willing to
receive a package.  For example, you may be a phone that wants to send
only the DTMF package but have no need to receive any INFOs. You need a
way to advertise what you are willing to send.

	In much older drafts, when it was really an offer/answer
handshake, there was some thought you might modify what you will
advertise. For example, if you advertised
	   Send-Info: old-foo, new-foo
	and the response had
	   Recv-Info: old-foo, new-foo
	the final response may just list
	   Send-Info: new-foo
	to let the UAS know you will only be sending new-foo.

	I am ambivalent about this.  What say you?

a race=20

		=09

	Agreed.


				  If the UAS receives an INFO request

				It was not clear to me that every dialog

				these header fields, e.g., for session

	Yes, and I would offer sending Send-Info/Recv-Info in every
(potential) state changing message means the protocol works in all
scenarios. It doesn't cost much in bytes, but I can see the argument
that if you ran a separate, light-weight keep-alive mechanism, it would
need to now know about INFO Packages.

	Me, too.


				- In 5.1, Why is Contact allowed in an

	The intention of the existing words is, in fact, case-sensitive.
Again, I can go either way.

The sense of UAC/UAS has not been changed at all, which is why it is  
complicated.  The document talks about a situation where (for example)  
a phone (UAC) calls a B2BUA (UAS) and then that selfsame B2BUA (UAC)  
sends an INFO to the phone (UAS).  Adam suggested a better way to  
describe the scenarios that will eliminate this confusion.  Namely,  
since this document focuses on INFO, when we talk about a phone  
calling a B2BUA, we will talk about the calling UA and the called UA.

Lots of people noticed this, and I will fix it.

I was 80% finished the text of why we had only one package per INFO  
when I realized an implementation would need 99% of the parsing  
machinery to deal with multiple packages per INFO 100% of the time.

The only cogent argument I have heard for why it would be nice to have  
one package per INFO is to be able to hand off the entire body to a  
subprocess dedicated to processing the info package type. However,  
that process would need to parse out its relevant body part, which  
makes this identical to handing the entire body to multiple  
subprocesses, which means one instantly gets processing multiple  
packages per INFO free.  Another way of implementing this is to have  
the SIP stack parse the multiple body parts to find the relevant INFO  
body part, but again one finds that you again get multiple packages  
per INFO free.

I will admit to a subversive reason for allowing multiple packages per  
INFO: it is a way of ensuring no one confuses a SIP transaction with  
an application transaction. Check out MSCML.  There is a lot of  
application logic to handle the fact an INFO transaction can succeed  
while the application transaction fails.  In this case, one had better  
return a 200 OK for the INFO request, and then some other indication  
(most likely an INFO in the reverse direction) of the problem with the  
payload.  Otherwise, I can envision people writing packages with  
language, "If you don't like the body for this transaction, send a 498  
SIP response code."

Because it represented a protocol failure.  However, note the tense of  
the last sentence.  A race condition was identified which hints that  
we really should just ignore unknown packages.  However, we want to  
make sure we have the strongest language that a UAC MUST NOT send an  
INFO the UAS has not indicated it will receive.

Theoretical world: give folks a vendor tree because there are truly  
proprietary usages that no one will care about; the only thing we care  
about is not colliding with the proprietary info package name.

Real world: this is where we get (just looking at THIS e-mail) X- 
Original-To, X-Virus-Scanned, X-Spam-Flag, X-Spam-Score, X-Spam-Level,  
X-Spam-Status, X-Mailer, X-Beenthere, X-Mailman-Version, of which 3  
are really used by the Internet infrastructure.  That is, they are  
beyond common usage and should be specified somewhere.

Also real world: no matter what we say, people will do proprietary  
usages.  I would offer specification required encourages some  
documentation - the bar is VERY low to publish an Individual  
Informational Proprietary document or, better yet, a link to the  
documentation on your corporate web site.

Obviously, this is not an issue for me personally to decide.  What  
does the work group want to do?

Yup - as said two weeks ago, I forgot your document.  Definitely  
should be folded in.

To comment on the multipart body question below, my understanding of the
requirement from the previous discussion is that it does not come from
the need to send two info packages at the same time.

Rather it comes from the need to send an info package plus some other
associated but yet to be described message body that happens to be
needed to be sent at the same time (e.g. info package containing a
Geolocation header pointing to a geolocation body in the same message).
If we could eliminate this, we could get rid of it, but I suspect we
cannot.

Given this, the support of multiple packages comes for free, so why
eliminate it.

However, whatever the result of this discussion, that does not mean that
we should in any sense make draft-ietf-sip-body-handling optional for
any method - it has to remain a mandatory part of RFC 3261. 

regards

Keith

:)

well, this is really guessing which can be quite brittle but isn't dialog
id safer? For lot of other things to function, it must be translated
consistently from A to X on one side and X to A in the reverse direction,
mustn't it? So that using some method with same callid/tags as the tested
INVITE should get to the same place?

I said "audio" - not RTP, not codec.  And sure the volume and frequency may be changed a bit.  Just talk slowly and calmly. ;)

Oh I don't think I'm guessing.  I'm pretty sure there's a large population of B2BUA's that will change the call-id and tags when requests go through them.  SBC's for example, but not just SBC's - lots of App/feature Servers too.

They will "fix" them for requests within that dialog, or some vendors can fix them for requests outside the dialog but only if the request flows through them or through another box in the same network.  In your case you can't send the return-check in-dialog ('cause that would be pointless presumably).  And you wouldn't even want to send it with a pre-loaded route-set of the received call attempt's path, because that would also be pointless.

And even if they get to the same set of b2bua's, you have to hope they each will "fix" the call-id_tags embedded in the body content of your check message to match the ones from the original INVITE, which is more than just normal "fixing" of the call-id+tags in the normal SIP headers.

So if you use the call-id+tags its chances of success are slim if there are b2bua's.  Of course it could be that your mechanism is popular enough that the b2bua's decide to add support for fixing it - like the Replaces header in REFER transfer cases was sufficiently popular to make b2bua's auto-fix the dialog info in them eventually.  Or it could end up like S/MIME.  Or you could choose to ignore b2bua's altogether.  Or you could pick something else to use for verification.

[JRE] It requires the B2BUA to modify the contents of the SUBSCRIBE and
NOTIFY bodies. If B2BUAs would do this, that would work. The problem I
see is that a non-compliant B2BUA might act as UAS for the SUBSCRIBE
request and send back a NOTIFY with its own dialog information. It only
proves that the call has come from that B2BUA, which doesn't mean much.
How does the callee UA distinguish this unhelpful case from the helpful
case where the SUBSCRIBE request has been relayed all the way back to
the caller's UA (or at least the caller's domain) and the NOTIFY comes
from there? I guess it falls back to using RFC 4474 to sign the NOTIFY
request. But then a NOTIFY request signed by the local domain's B2BUA is
unhelpful, and a NOTIFY request from the caller's UA or its domain
proxy/B2BUA would have its signature broken by intervening B2BUAs. So we
are back where we started.

I suppose we have two seemingly incompatible requirements:
- it must work through any "reasonable" B2BUA behaviour in such a way
that the callee UA can detect whether e2e return routability has been
achieved;
- it must work without modifications to existing caller UAs.

If it is indeed impossible to satisfy both requirements, then which of
these is more important?

John

Obviously the former. But we might end-up designing a B2BUA traversal 
mechanism to exchange either the original call-id, or some other piece 
of information. IMO, the principle of DERIVE might be kept, even if we 
are using something else as the dialog event package. The key is that we 
need something to correlate on.

I was referring to myself, when I mean guessing :)

In your case you can't send the return-check in-dialog ('cause that would be pointless presumably).  And you wouldn't even want to send it with a pre-loaded route-set of the received call attempt's path, because that would also be pointless.

Messages with some dialog-id but not in-dialog could get translated
consistently but supposedly they will break just because of such an
unusual message constructions anyhow.

>

Of course it could be that your mechanism is popular enough that the b2bua's decide to add support for fixing it - like the Replaces header in REFER transfer cases was sufficiently popular to make b2bua's auto-fix the dialog info in them eventually.  Or it could end up like S/MIME.  Or you could choose to ignore b2bua's altogether.  Or you could pick something else to use for verification.

P-Charging-Vector? :)

Greetings,

Here a few comments and questions concerning draft-ietf-sip-199-02.

Section 4 paragraph 4:  Concerning "the client SHALL discard the 199
responses", is "SHALL" too strong since 100rel may be used?  The
strength of "SHALL" is likely only an issue if 18x did not contain
100rel and 199 did.

Section 4 last paragraph: The use of "will act" should likely be changed
to reflect an RFC 2119 defined word.

Section 6 paragraph 2 first sentence: The use of "proxy MUST generate"
should likely be downgraded to SHOULD or MAY too clearly allow the proxy
to avoid sending 199 when forwarding to server expected to answer
quickly (such a voice mail server).

Section 6 paragraph 2 last sentence: Since using another's To tag when
sending the 199, the draft should mention something concerning headers
Contact and Record-Route.  If proxy chooses not to add them, a missing
Contact and Record-Route will not be an issue for UAC; however another
proxy (not supporting this draft) may be surprised to see their
Record-Route entry missing.  Additionally since this draft defines a 1xx
with To tag which does not create a dialog (unless section 4 paragraph 4
modified), does this draft update RFC 3261?

Section 7: Concerning "MUST reply to such requests with a 481", the text
should likely defer behavior to RFC 3261 concerning receiving requests
with To tag associated terminated/unknown dialog.

Sections 9 and 10: Concerning the "MUST NOT"s related to SDP, should
they be downgraded to a "SHOULD NOT" to still allow offer/answer
compliance if desired?

The as-yet-undocumented Globally Unique Call Control Identifier, or  
"GUCCI" . . . It's just like the Call-ID, but SBC's don't change it  
(yet) because they don't about it (yet). Of course, that will change  
once the RFC is published and some crazed operator beats their SBC  
vendor into implementing a GUCCI updating algorithm. I predict that  
this "feature" will be managed under the codename "Paris spring  
fashion show", but that's not important right now.

What IS important is that we understand that no such feature can be  
made to work with an SBC that is actively disrupting it. We already  
wrote specs that said "Don't do this", and they did it anyhow, so why  
should we expect them to cooperate the next time? Rational or not,  
there are reasons for most of this behavior.

And that's my point. Hadriel stood up and effectively said "SBCs break 
everything. If you want identity to work, you need to find something 
that SBCs don't break."

My understanding of set theory is somewhat rudimentary, but I am fairly 
certain that the inverse of the universe is the null set, and that the 
intersection of the null set and anything else will always be the null set.

So, unless you can point out the flaw in that logic, then the only 
progress we can make is by ignoring SBCs and hope they catch up.

Free? Certainly not.

If, as an implementor, all I care about is INFO, and I don't have any 
other use case for multipart (which, as of now, are mostly niche uses 
and are not common), I'll now NEED to implement multipart for INFO.

So, I don't have a problem saying that INFO can contain multiple bodies 
as any message can, but I do have a problem with the idea that the INFO 
framework ITSELF allows multiple packages per INFO.

Either a new header or a new parameter.  We seem to be getting this requirement a lot lately in various SIP-related WG's: we need some unique per-call identifier thingy that crosses b2bua's without change.  I propose we just standardize one, but avoid making it have any property which made changing call-id value's a necessity. (like don't put addressing info in it, and don't make it a dialog match criteria in the state machine, etc.)  I was planning to submit a draft to do that before the deadline, but was too busy.

It would require the UA's to change to support it if you want to use it for Derive, but somehow I don't really believe a significant market share of deployed UA's support the rfc4235 subscribe dialog-package yet either (despite Sipit's poll).  And I think we'd have uses for a logical call-id not in Call-ID.

Is this a concern just for legacy usage or is there a wider concern.

draft-ietf-sip-body handling updates RFC 3261:

     Message Body Handling in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                  draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-04.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.  Mandatory Support for 'multipart' Message Bodies

   For all MIME-based extensions to work, the recipient needs to be able
   to decode the multipart bodies.  Therefore, SIP UAs MUST support
   parsing 'multipart' MIME bodies, including nested body parts.  In
   particular, UAs MUST support the 'multipart/mixed' and 'multipart/
   alternative' MIME types.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As this draft is hopefully going to get published before or at the same time as info-events, I would expect all new info package implementations to support - afterall, it is mandatory.

regards

Keith

Actually, I'm pretty sure I said *B2BUA's* change the Call-ID and tags, and that there were far more than just SBCs.  Honestly, most every box I see traces from appears to be a b2bua of some form or other these days. (of course that's probably because of the types of networks my product's in to begin with, so it's a myopic view I know)  Some of these b2bua's change the call-id+tags, some don't.

The set of the universe is not germane to the issue at hand.  Many B2BUA's change call-id+tags; that says nothing about whether they change other things.  And it says nothing about their motivation for the changes.

SBC's cannot "catch up" to not change call-id's - it's what their owners want them to do.  Speaking as just one vendor, we don't change call-id's and tags by *default*.  Virtually EVERYONE changes that default behavior and configures us to change the call-id and tags as soon as they install the system.  That doesn't mean they will change anything no matter what - they have specific motivation for changing the call-id.  The IETF SIP WG gave them that motivation, by putting an IP Address in it.  That was a mistake.  It was a big mistake.

There are reasons people change Call-ID's, and reasons people change To-URI, From-URI, contact-URI, SDP, etc.  Absolutely.  If you need some mechanism Foo, and the purpose or use or syntax of Foo goes against the wishes of the owner of an SBC, then be prepared for Foo to not work or be changed.  That is kinda the point of an SBC after all: control.

When it comes to a "call identifier string", which is unique for each high-level "call", I don't think that goes against the wishes of most SBC owners, or B2BUA owners.  It just can't identify the IP-Address/hostname/port of the UA or anything really, should not be a URI, should not be in a body, and should not be overly long.

I'm afraid that's the best conclusion we can make indeed.

I'm with Jonathan - the latest INFO draft is 41 pages long.  RFC 3428 for MESSAGE method was 18 pages long.  The entire Subscribe/Notify RFC 3265 was only 38 pages long.
Something ain't right.

Of course a SIP message can have multiple bodies.  That doesn't mean we have to define the whole thing or make it explicit in this doc.  If Sub/not didn't specify it, why does INFO have to?

SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY didn't specify it because (1) the Event: header as  
specifies ensures only a single payload and (2) implementations may  
find themselves hopelessly broken when a legal, RFC 3261, multipart  
payload shows up.

INFO has to specify it so we do not barf.

The "what" the INFO document is doing that SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY did not  
have to do is explain why we have INFO at all.

I agree with Hadriel and Jonathan. I don't think we need to send INFO with multiple packages.

If you have an application that needs to send multiple body parts, then define an Info-Package that contains multiple body parts and describe what each of those are. Then multiple part would only be required for UAs that need to support that package.

cheers,

I'm with Jonathan - the latest INFO draft is 41 pages long.  RFC 3428 for MESSAGE method was 18 pages long.  The entire Subscribe/Notify RFC 3265 was only 38 pages long.
Something ain't right.

Of course a SIP message can have multiple bodies.  That doesn't mean we have to define the whole thing or make it explicit in this doc.  If Sub/not didn't specify it, why does INFO have to?

Right now INFO works, and no such problem exists.  What does Subscribe/Notify do to cover this problem?

Future specs can fix themselves by specifying what to do, if they support mime content types which could be that ambiguous.  The base INFO spec doesn't need to fix it for all, if it's only a problem for some possible future use no one actually has.

This is bogus.

We do not *NEED* to define what happens when INFO has multiple info 
packages in it. If the syntax allows just one, and the spec allows just 
one, there can only be one.

And I will reiterate that, this is a separate question from whether an 
INFO can contain multipart, where one body is an INFO package object and 
the other is for a different reason (AIB). We are debating whether the 
INFO framework itself allows for multiple packages per INFO.

Less is more. We don't need more features just because they are 'free' 
from a hypothetical standards perspective. This argument is also bogus.

If you have an application that sends multiple body parts, it already  
MUST package it into a single body part (multipart/mixed, most  
likely). That's not the issue.

It is not a theory. Once you have to explicitly identify the body part  
for an Info Package, you can identify the body part for ANY Info  
Package.

Can you propose a simpler way to unambiguously identify the body part  
with a mechanism other than Content-ID?  That will help me see a way  
how one would have to add work to handle multiple body parts, as  
demanded by RFC 3261.

There are some limitations indeed -- if a gateway calls a SIP phone,
and supports DERIVE, DERIVE actually asserts "can I reach *a gateway
you are momentarily using*" (as opposed to say "I can reach you via
your address"). Still I think that's meeting the "better-than-nothing"
expectation offered by DERIVE. If we wanted to get closer to the caller,
we would have to dig in the PSTN protocols.

There is a practical and IMO worse concern: a telephone number can resolve
to way too many places: SIP routing is not symmetric in this case and
pstn-2-sip request can take a different path than sip-2-pstn request. Thus
a verifier can very likely end up with a different GW than the one
which initated the call in question. (If the phone number is offered
in From as tel URI, one could for example try to perform an ENUM
query with non-e164 result but I'm not sure it make sense -- in the end,
if there is such URI it could have been put in From straight).

that's the best we can get, without PSTN interaction the
gateway has to act on the party's behalf.

It does not have to be the proxy, it can be the gateway but the
real problem is IMO if the SUBSCRIBE gets there at all. If it
gets there, I think a) is the appropriate answer. (or b) if
it does not support DERIVE). c) is apparently a difficult one.

If there is a single body, then the body part of the INFO is for the one 
and only package. If there are multiple bodies, one would be for the 
INFO package, and the rest for something else. I am fine with a cid in 
this case. But there is STILL just one info package per INFO message, 
and the only reason for multipart would be reasons having nothing to do 
with INFO framework.

But if there are multiple body parts (only one of which is an INFO  
body) , INFO requires a mechanism for finding the right body part.

We can't delimit this based on the MIME type for the same reason we  
can't just do a one-to-one map between INFO and MIME -- sometimes a  
single MIME type is used in different ways for different applications.

So far, the only reasonable way proposed to identify the MIME body  
associated with an INFO package is a MIME CID identifier that points  
from the INFO package header to the body. According to this model,  
INFO compliant UAs must understand multipart MIME (as the body  
handling draft requires), and they must understand Content-ID.

If we have this mechanism, it works just as effectively and  
automatically for multiple INFO bodies per message as it does for a  
singular body per message.



We could probably say nothing about singular or multiple INFO package  
bodies per INFO message in the draft, and nothing would change in the  
mechanism at all:

1) Parse header
2) If current header is an Info package identifier, parse out the CID
3) Search through the bodies until you find the right CID
4) If there are more headers, go to step 1


One could probably complicate this by adding a state about "But if  
you've already found one Info package header, ignore all subsequent  
ones and their associated body parts", but that actually makes the  
logic MORE complicated, not less.

(based on Adam's note that there is a nuance between e.164 numbers and
PSTN destinations)....
I don't think we can realiably cover PSTN destinations, primarily because
of asymmetric routing -- there are too many UASs that can serve a PSTN
destination.

I think it should be important feature of DERIVE that it makes minimum
assumptions about trust. Managing trust relationships is IMO equaly or
more prohibitive than putting security protocols in place and I hope we
can accomodate scenarios that are happy with  better-than-nothing without
trust models. (Apart from trust in uncompromised DNS and IP).

And we'd need a header, like "Session-ID", or "B2bua-Pwn3d".

[JRE] In fact SIPIT showed 16% support for the dialog event package, but
there is no analysis of how many of these were UAs that supported the
package as notifiers, as opposed to subscribers. My suspicion is that
the population is small. Requiring support for something like a unique
call identifier, plus a simple event package to confirm its presence,
would probably be no more onerous than requiring support for the dialog
event package as notifier.

By "lunch will be provided" I meant "we will meet during the lunch  
slot, 11:30am - 1:00pm, and we will feed you."

So, for all of those who thought we were having an all-day meeting,  
sorry :-)

Anyway, be there, Symphony 1&2 (second floor), tomorrow, Tuesday, 11/18.

Isn't there some rule somewhere about the order of the body parts making a difference if multiples of the same type/disp are received?  Or am I having a memory corruption?
Like since the INFO package is the generator of the message, can't we just say the first/top-most one is the package's?  Maybe I'm dreaming.

*Only* devices supporting that specific INFO package would need to care.  Since we'll have an indication/negotiation of support for specific INFO packages, only devices which implement support for such packages would need to discern such an ambiguity.  We don't have this problem right now, because we don't have such a package in mind.  Ergo we don't need to solve it.  Let the specific package definitions do it if they need it - make them pay the price for their issue.

-hadriel
p.s. and I'm only arguing to reduce this thing because the main carrot for this draft was to not make it much more work for developers from current INFO usage.  It doesn't have to be perfect - just good enough.

Be careful how you use measurements like that 16%. Note that the same
measurement at the previous SIPit was 28%. My rough feel is that about
1/3 of the UAs around now have or are in the process of implementing
this package.

I can't clarify right now how much of those act as servers. Based on  
casual
conversations, I expect that we'll find its most of them. I'll ask in  
more detail
at my next opportunity.

What about two or more instances of the SAME Info package? Do we need to
say anything about that, and if so what? If we limit it to one Info
package, this issue doesn't arise.

Hi,

There is another INFO usage in RFC 5168 for video fast update see section 8.

I suggest adding it to annex B of draft-ietf-sip-info-events-01

Thanks

This isn't a concern, though.  Even if the return routing worked
perfectly and you got back to the very same PSTN gateway, the
best you can achieve is trusting the caller-id asserted by the
PSTN.  Which can be spoofed, as we all know.  So, DERIVE to
an E.164 that terminates on a PSTN gateway can't tell you too
much; DERIVE to an E.164 that terminates on a SIP UA can be
pretty worthwhile.  I admit that a PSTN gateway could lie and
pretend to be a normal SIP UA; thus, a DERIVE validation of
an E.164 isn't as trustworthy as a DERIVE validation of an
email-style SIP URI because the PSTN gateway could lie.

If we had a way to determine who 'owns' an E.164, we could
make that owner prove they received the DERIVE query (by
asking them to encrypt something with their private key), 
which prevents a PSTN gateway from lying.  This is something 
that could be bolted on later, if/when we figure out how 
to map an E.164 to certificate that 'owns' it.

Subject: [SIP-XMPP] Bar BOF @ IETF 73

For those of you at IETF 73 in Minneapolis, we're going to hold a small
"Bar BOF" about SIP-XMPP interworking at lunchtime on Wednesday.

So that I have an idea of how many people to expect, please let me know
by the end of the day Tuesday if you want to participate.

Let's meet at 11:30 in the hotel lobby and we'll either eat at the hotel
or find a place nearby (I like Hell's Kitchen, myself).

Peter

Howdy,
In the SIP WG today there was a discussion on whether 199 was just an optimization, and what its benefits/use-cases are that warrant working on it.  I read the draft but I didn't grok what the big deal/need for it was.  It keeps talking about "resources" as if that's some big limiting factor that saving a few dozen seconds-worth of would be a big advantage.  I understand DSP resource limitations but I couldn't see how you were going to truly save them just because you get a 199, because as far as you know there will be other forks that will use those codecs too so until the 200 ok comes back you can't unallocate them.  So then I thought maybe the draft was referring to bandwidth, but AFAIK most folks don't reserve bandwidth for all forks because they know only one of them will succeed in the end, so they pick the worst one until the call is answered.

But I think there are some real use-cases for this 199 response, that are *more* than an optimization: they affect user experience. (which is much more important IMO)

        Case 1: You're a basic endpoint or PSTN Gateways the UAC, and have to pick one of many 183 w/SDP responses for which to play early media for.  Typically they pick the first one received, and don't change until the 200 ok. (some pick the most recently received one instead, but that's just guessing too)  So if I call Bob, and it went to a simple find-me-follow-me service, the service plays "we're looking for Bob, please hold...".  Once it finds Bob, and Bob's phone rings, I would like my UAC to stop listening to the announcement and instead switch to Bob's ringback.  So the proxy needs to send my UAC the 199.

        Case 2: Your call went through some evil SBC thingy, which is doing NAT traversal fixing for the far-end.  Typically SBC's "latch" onto the RTP stream from the far-end, such that they only forward media to the latched address, and only allow media back through from that far-end.  They can play tricks to let media move, but typically if the call forked there is no moving from the first latched one until the 200 ok, because they know the UAC can only play one of the streams anyway, and they don't bother allocating more hardware for naught; and if the UAC was itself behind a NAT then there's only one pinhole to get media back through anyway.  So if a 199 were sent back from the forking proxy, it would let the SBC re-latch or pick another flow, and get the other media through, even by sending it back through the same single NAT pinhole.  Again, it's not so much a resource thing - it's a user experience thing.

        Case 3: SRTP.  Like the latching case, middle-boxes or gateways that terminate SRTP typically only terminate it for one of the forks, because again they themselves can only render one, or they assume the UAC will only play one RTP stream anyway, and only one will get through the SBC's or NAT pinholes to begin with, so allocating more SRTP hardware crypto engines for multiple forked response SDP's/keys has no value.  So like the SBC case, if they got the 199, they could change their SRTP hardware to start decrypting another fork's keys, and the user would hear something different.

At the request of an author, we've removed the SAML draft from the  
Thursday agenda. They have recently received some good feedback, and  
have some changes to make to the draft as a result. The surrendered  
time has been re-allocated to the other topics.

Hi Hadriel, 

>In the SIP WG today there was a discussion on whether 199 was just an
optimization, and what its benefits/use-cases are 
>that warrant working on it.

I guess it depends on what we mean by "optimiztion". The new thing is
that thee UAC can get informed about terminated early dialogs when it
happens. Is that only optimization, or is it also new functionality?

>I read the draft but I didn't grok what the big deal/need for it was.
It keeps talking

>comes back you can't unallocate them. 

There MAY be other forks that use the codecs.

And, it's not only about the number of different codecs used, but for
how many media sessions the UA manages to use a specific fork.

>So then I thought maybe the draft was referring to bandwidth, but AFAIK
most folks don't reserve bandwidth for all forks 
>because they know only one of them will succeed in the end, so they

It is true that Uas in many cases will not reserved bandwidth for an
unlimited number of forks. BUT, they are still required to provide
quality for the forks they DO accept, which means they may only accept a
certain number of early dialogs. So, in those cases it is good to know
when a previously used early dialog is not used anymore, so that another
early dialog can be accepted instead.

>But I think there are some real use-cases for this 199 response, that
are *more* than an optimization: they affect user 
>experience. (which is much more important IMO)

The examples above ARE real-life issues - at least in the
mobile-wireless-limited-bandwidth-limited-dsp-limited-battery-limited-me
mory environment where I am working. The reason I started to work with
the draft in the first place was in order to be able to use to solve
(or, at least ease) such problems.

Correct. That is how many gateways/UACs work today, and one use-case
I've had in mind where 199 could be useful. The reaons I didn't add it
to the draft before was because it is not so much related to resources,
but more to early dialog policy, but for sure I could add it to the
draft.

Correct. It even doesn't have to be a full scale SBC. It could also be a
gating type of function. 

I could add that example also, but I want to avoid
we-make-this-just-because-SBCs-have-problems type of comments :)

Correct. I think the draft does talk about media plane security, but
maybe mostly on the in-band negotiation part.

Hi Dale,

we are in agreement here. I also agree that rephrasing the text per your 
suggestion will make it clearer and more explicit.

> These

Therefore, I will make this change in the three sentences in the 
following revision of the draft.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

note that the verb is "can". That is, it is possible that all the body 
parts are optional... but that is not the only possibility. The 
possibility you mention (i.e., a required body part within a required 
multipart/mixed) is also possible. That paragraph you are referring to 
simply points out cases that may be surprising for readers, per earlier 
mailing list discussions, so that they are clearer.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Hi,

The main open issue in the 199 draft at the moment is when a UAS sends
199 - IF a UAS sends 199.

The alternative proposals I have at the moment are described below (can
also be found in the slides I was supposed to present yesterday).


1.	UAS never sends 199:

In this case only forking proxies/B2BUA would send 199.



2.	UAS always sends 199:

The issue with this alternative is that 199 would be sent even if no
forking has occurred - which can be assumed to be the case in a large
percentage of all calls.

=20

3.	UAS sends 199 if forking proxy does not support 199:

With this alternative the forking proxy would have to insert an
indicator that it supports 199.

Also, the UAS may not know whether it is the forking proxy closest to
the UAS that has inserted the indicator. This may not be a big issues,
since I assume in most forking cases there will only be one forking
proxy in the signalling path.




4.	UAS sends 199 once procedures have reached a certain state

With this alternative 199 would not be sent until certain actions have
taken place on an early dialog

Example: preconditions have been indicated as met
Example: SDP answer has been sent

The issue is that one would always have to specify at what point of
different procedures 199 would be sengt.



5.	UAC and UAS negotiate sending of 199 once the early dialog has
been established:

With this alternative that UAC would tell the UAS that forking has
occurred (could this be useful information also for non-199
procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be sent.

The issues with this alternative is that it may require additional
signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't be sent for other reasons) to
inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

Other alternatives?=20

NOTE: Robert S also raised an issue on what Require: 199 means. But, I
think that outcome of that issue may depend on what way forward we
choose for the issue in this mail.

Regards,

Christer

Let's imagine that there is a base DTMF package defined that supports  
the 12 basic keys. Now cisco makes a vendor specific package that is  
pretty much the same but includes key presses for the  "HOLD" button.   
Nortel does pretty much the same but calls it the "F1" button. Now  
SNOM wants to build a phone that supports both and in fact is  
operating in an environment with a Nortel PBX, Cisco Voice Mail, and  
Asterix SBC which understands both - the phone really needs to send  
both and they need to be one atomic action so they are not interpreted  
as the wrong thing or as double key presses.

It seems that things along the lines of the above will happen and need  
to be considered. I don't know if this means an INFO needs to carry  
more that one thing or not. The worst possible solution I can imaging  
to this is that SNOM builds a new package that combines the Cisco and  
Nortel package.

Cullen <in my individual contributor roll>

PS - I do not care if people want to solve this use case or not. I  
just mention it as something I view as somewhat likely to happen. I am  
happy with whatever get's decided.

Questions:

1)	Do you achieve any better interoperability by preventing this
happening? Will SNON build something that is directly equivalent in
functionality to Cisco + Nortel

2)	If an individual vendor specifies their own package, then can we
control this except by expert review? And if we do that expert review,
do we provide a barrier to registration. At least if we have an open
registration we could keep an eye on the registration page and encourage
people who are registering similar things to cooperate on a combined
package.

And finally, I believe we are pushing in the direction of it is up to
the package specifiers to specify the interaction with any other
package, and therefore SIP will not specify any of "they need to be one
atomic action so they are not interpreted as the wrong thing or as
double key presses".

Keith

I would like to make draft-ietf-sip-199 more useful by expanding 
it's capabilities.

I would like to add a REQ-2 that allows that the Proxy to indicate
WHY the dialog was terminated. 

This would be done by having the 199 response include (as a sifrag or watever) 
the actual error response that terminated the dialog. At a minimum it would
include the value of the error code itself.

I would like to add text in the second-to-last paragraph of section
one that explains that the reason for specific dialogs to be terminated
may be useful for the client to take appropriate action (for example, by
re-attempting a call to a specific branch when the error is 
recoverable). And some similar text in section 4 on UAC behavior.

I think that would make the document more useful.

PS: I also agree with Hadriel's use cases as generally more useful than the
ones currently listed in the draft.

I'm thinking this is an argument against a vendor tree and in favor of  
a spec-required policy that allows minimal specifications.

The word "snom" triggered my attention ;-)

Regarding buttons we implemented something on our own which probably addres=
ses the case below (see http://wiki.snom.com/Features/LED_Remote_Control). =
Not only Cisco does have their own extensions! It is not enough for use to =
have F1 or HOLD buttons description; we must also be able to control LED an=
d displays associated with the button. So far our little dirty protocol sol=
ves that problem in a nice way and we can offer the features that the tradi=
tional PBX were able to offer. =


But I agree. The interop level in SIP regarding buttons barely goes beyond =
POTS and 12-key DTMF. Vendors like snom today have no other choice but a se=
lection box that says what kind of SIP the phones should talk. It is a mess!

Betreff: [Sip] INFO Use case


Let's imagine that there is a base DTMF package defined that supports the 1=
2 basic keys. Now cisco makes a vendor specific package that is  =

pretty much the same but includes key presses for the  "HOLD" button.   =

Nortel does pretty much the same but calls it the "F1" button. Now SNOM wan=
ts to build a phone that supports both and in fact is operating in an envir=
onment with a Nortel PBX, Cisco Voice Mail, and Asterix SBC which understan=
ds both - the phone really needs to send both and they need to be one atomi=
c action so they are not interpreted as the wrong thing or as double key pr=
esses.

It seems that things along the lines of the above will happen and need to b=
e considered. I don't know if this means an INFO needs to carry more that o=
ne thing or not. The worst possible solution I can imaging to this is that =
SNOM builds a new package that combines the Cisco and Nortel package.

Cullen <in my individual contributor roll>

PS - I do not care if people want to solve this use case or not. I just men=
tion it as something I view as somewhat likely to happen. I am happy with w=
hatever get's decided. =

My opinion is that 199 shouldn't be restricted to cases involving
forking, since some of its utility lies in mitigating the behavior of
middle boxes that mis-interpret what they see as forking.
=20
Is it possible to define a simpler version of alternative #4, giving
general guidance as to when a 199 may be issued and being prescriptive
about what the recipient is to do upon its receipt?

	Subject: [Sip] 199 Open Issue: UAS sending 199
=09
=09


	Hi,=20

	The main open issue in the 199 draft at the moment is when a UAS
sends 199 - IF a UAS sends 199.=20

	The alternative proposals I have at the moment are described
below (can also be found in the slides I was supposed to present
yesterday).


	1.      UAS never sends 199:=20

	In this case only forking proxies/B2BUA would send 199.=20



	2.      UAS always sends 199:=20

	The issue with this alternative is that 199 would be sent even
if no forking has occurred - which can be assumed to be the case in a
large percentage of all calls.

=09

	3.      UAS sends 199 if forking proxy does not support 199:=20

	With this alternative the forking proxy would have to insert an
indicator that it supports 199.=20

	Also, the UAS may not know whether it is the forking proxy
closest to the UAS that has inserted the indicator. This may not be a
big issues, since I assume in most forking cases there will only be one
forking proxy in the signalling path.




	4.      UAS sends 199 once procedures have reached a certain
state=20

	With this alternative 199 would not be sent until certain
actions have taken place on an early dialog=20

	Example: preconditions have been indicated as met=20
	Example: SDP answer has been sent=20

	The issue is that one would always have to specify at what point
of different procedures 199 would be sengt.=20



	5.      UAC and UAS negotiate sending of 199 once the early
dialog has been established:=20

	With this alternative that UAC would tell the UAS that forking
has occurred (could this be useful information also for non-199
procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be sent.

	The issues with this alternative is that it may require
additional signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't be sent for other
reasons) to inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

	Other alternatives?=20

	NOTE: Robert S also raised an issue on what Require: 199 means.
But, I think that outcome of that issue may depend on what way forward
we choose for the issue in this mail.

	Regards,=20

	Christer=20

I prefer the goal of option 1.  B2BUA (which is a UAS) or proxy sends
199 whenever it desires to indicate termination of a dialog and sending
a final INVITE response is not yet appropriate.  The subsequent INVITE
final response SHOULD contain a different To tag than those sent within
199s.  A device which does not trigger more than 1 To tag (i.e. fork or
simulate forking interaction) for an INVITE, SHOULD NOT generate a 199
since it needs to generate subsequent final failure response with the
same To tag.

<snip>


> Robert S also raised an issue on what Require: 199 means.

It means the UAS is required to support the RFC.

Depending upon RFC (working group decision), "Require: 199" means UAS
MAY, SHOULD, or MUST send 199 for early dialogs containing To tags
different than the INVITE's subsequent final response To tag; I prefer
MAY.

Depending upon RFC (working group decision), "Require: 199" also means
UAS MAY, SHOULD, MUST, or SHOULD NOT send 199 for early dialog
containing To tag which is the same as the INVITE's subsequent final
response To tag; I prefer SHOULD NOT.  If MUST is preferred, I would
desire usage of a different option-tag such as "failure-reason" or
"termination-reason".

That's a good point - maybe even a new alternative #6: UAS sends 199 if
it is handling more than one early dialog.

Yes. I think the Require:199 thing would be more tricky if an UAS NEVER
sends 199.

But, in any case I agree with Robert S that it is good to clarify the
meaning of Require in the draft.

Christer

	Subject: [Sip] 199 Open Issue: UAS sending 199
=09
=09


	Hi,=20

	The main open issue in the 199 draft at the moment is when a UAS
sends 199 - IF a UAS sends 199.=20

	The alternative proposals I have at the moment are described
below (can also be found in the slides I was supposed to present
yesterday).


	1.      UAS never sends 199:=20

	In this case only forking proxies/B2BUA would send 199.=20



	2.      UAS always sends 199:=20

	The issue with this alternative is that 199 would be sent even
if no forking has occurred - which can be assumed to be the case in a
large percentage of all calls.

=09

	3.      UAS sends 199 if forking proxy does not support 199:=20

	With this alternative the forking proxy would have to insert an
indicator that it supports 199.=20

	Also, the UAS may not know whether it is the forking proxy
closest to the UAS that has inserted the indicator. This may not be a
big issues, since I assume in most forking cases there will only be one
forking proxy in the signalling path.




	4.      UAS sends 199 once procedures have reached a certain
state=20

	With this alternative 199 would not be sent until certain
actions have taken place on an early dialog=20

	Example: preconditions have been indicated as met=20
	Example: SDP answer has been sent=20

	The issue is that one would always have to specify at what point
of different procedures 199 would be sengt.=20



	5.      UAC and UAS negotiate sending of 199 once the early
dialog has been established:=20

	With this alternative that UAC would tell the UAS that forking
has occurred (could this be useful information also for non-199
procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be sent.

	The issues with this alternative is that it may require
additional signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't be sent for other
reasons) to inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

	Other alternatives?=20

	NOTE: Robert S also raised an issue on what Require: 199 means.
But, I think that outcome of that issue may depend on what way forward
we choose for the issue in this mail.

	Regards,=20

	Christer=20

I'm not sure I understand the problem.  If Cisco and Nortel make a vendor-specific package, then by definition it is vendor specific.  If they wanted to make it useable by everyone, they would go through an RFC process, not a vendor-specific namespace.  And I don't know why they would define a vendor-specific package which reproduced the same set of buttons as a published DTMF one - I would think they'd only be for the new/different buttons that the published RFC didn't handle.

But anyway, lets say Snom is an environment with all 3 and has figured out the vendor-specific ones.  They're only talking to one UAS though, and will use whatever the UAS supports.  Snom would advertise all 3 packages in their Recv-Info header, if they supported all 3.  The far-end UAS would say what it can handle for that specific call.

Let's say the UAS supported all 3.  So the user presses a button.  Snom is now free to send it however it wants, because the other end supports all 3.  Since they knew what the packages were that they implemented, they would know they're for the same button, that the action is atomic, and that they should only send it in one of the packages.  Presumably Nortel or Cisco's vendor-specific package logic would handle such things appropriately - if not that's their problem - it's a vendor-specific package.  You reap what you sow. ;)

The agreement in Dublin was to not say anything about sipfrag. But, I am
ok with putting it back, especially if people want more use-cases. I
guess it could be optional for the UAC to inidicate support of sipfrag.

>PS: I also agree with Hadriel's use cases as generally more useful than
the ones currently listed in the draft.

My intention is to add those use-cases to the next version of the draft.

Regards,

Christer

Folks,

I have just submitted a new revision of the body handling draft:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-05.txt

This revision addresses the last comments received on the list plus a 
few off-line comments from John Elwell regarding adding a few 
effectively empty sections for completeness.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi Christer,

It doesn't have to be sipfrag. Just the plain value of the 
error response code would work too.  Whatever is easier.

I just think that getting the reason WHY the fork failed is
useful.

response code would work too.  Whatever is easier.

Maybe the Reason header could be used? Or a new parameter. I agree that
sipfrag is a little too "heavy" for sending a response code.

Yeah, reason header seems appropriate and would be good enough I think.

Interesting scenario. Good thing there is a B2BUA and not a proxy.  
This is because either:
    UA-SNOM is talking first the Nortel PBX, in which case it will see  
a Recv-Info: Nortel_DTMF from the UAS
    UA-SNOM is talking with the Cisco VM, in which case it will see a  
Recv-Info: Cisco_DTMF from the UAS
Or,
    UA-SNOM will see a Recv-Info: Acme_DTMF
because the SBC will be doing normalization.

The really interesting scenario is where the PBX is the B2BUA, and the  
signaling goes through the PBX. In this case it should take the  
packages from the VM and combine it with its own PBX packages. In this  
case
    UA-SNOM will see a Recv-Info: Nortel_DTMF, Cisco_DTMF

What is messed up with this situation is UA-SNOM has to know whether  
it is in "PBX mode" or "VM mode" to know which package to use. Worse  
yet, what happens if the phone says, "Well, the UAS is giving me the  
choice of Nortel or Cisco. I'll chose Nortel" and then proceed to be  
connected to the Cisco box. The Cisco box then barfs.

Of course, this is less harmful if the implementors went with
    Recv-Info: DTMF, Nortel_Extra_Keys, Cisco_Extra_Keys


Is this an argument for Send-Info?  If UA-SNOM says, "Send-Info: DTMF,  
Nortel_Extra_Keys" to Cisco, Cisco can say, "Oh no you don't." The  
down side: this would require real capabilities negotiation, which we  
said we wanted to punt.

Howdy,
I know it's bad form to submit a draft during the IETF, but oh well.
I submitted a draft for a call-id type thing that's not actually a call-id,=
 to get through B2BUA's, for a bunch of uses noted in the draft.

Comments appreciated, as always.  Heckling welcomed too. :)

Well, with REFER sipfrag is typically used to carry only the response 
code. Sending more is optional. If something is to be sent then I think 
this is a good mechanism for doing so. I think the question would be 
whether sending the sipfrag with at least the reason is MUST, SHOULD, or 
MAY.

OTOH, I thought this was removed from the draft because some people 
thought this smacked too much of solving the HERFP problem when it 
didn't really do the job fully. Has anything changed?

	Thanks,
	Paul

I think these changes generally look good. I'm now troubled by one thing:

In section 8.2 (UA Behavior to Set the 'handling' Parameter) the 
following statement is repeated:

"If the handling of a 'multipart/*' body as a whole is required for 
processing its enclosing body part or message" where * is {mixed, 
alternative, related}.

For alternative and related this makes sense to me. But I don't know 
what this means for 'mixed'. How would I know if I had to process this 
*as a whole*, since there is no "as a whole" behavior of such a thing. 
AFAIK the mixed container has no significance of its own - it is *only* 
a container for its parts, each of which has its own significance.

I'm just trying to understand from an operational perspective how I 
would make a decision between optional and required for a mixed body 
part. The only things I can think of are:
- for some reason the mixed container is *referenced* from something.
   E.g. a cid: uri referencing the content-id header in the mixed itself.
   But I can't think of a reason to do that. It would seem to me that
   if I need to do that then the parts must be related in some way,
   so that I would be using multipart/related.

- one or more of the *contained* parts of the mixed are required,
   and the container is being marked required to ensure that the
   required contained parts will indeed be processed.
   This seems the most sensible situation here.

Am I missing something that makes this easier to understand?

	Thanks,
	Paul

Howdy,
I know it's bad form to submit a draft during the IETF, but oh well.
I submitted a draft for a call-id type thing that's not actually a call-id, 
to get through B2BUA's, for a bunch of uses noted in the draft.

Comments appreciated, as always.  Heckling welcomed too. :)

Hadriel,
I am glad you bruoght up this issue. As a carrier, we need such a mechanism 
for diagnostics.
The problem which I  have with this particular solution is that it requires 
changes in existing user devices.

Regards
Laura

Christer,
=20
Sorry, when I said "mis-interpret what they see as forking" I meant to
refer to serial forking, which is of course a form of forking.  So
there's no mis-interpretation (except mine!). =20
=20
But anyway the thought was that by providing a way to explicitly release
an early media stream the 199 could enable a "middle box" (SBC) that
today blocks serial forking, to support it.  This is one of the use
cases Hadriel mentioned.

		Subject: [Sip] 199 Open Issue: UAS sending 199
	=09
	=09


		Hi,=20

		The main open issue in the 199 draft at the moment is
when a UAS sends 199 - IF a UAS sends 199.=20

		The alternative proposals I have at the moment are
described below (can also be found in the slides I was supposed to
present yesterday).


		1.      UAS never sends 199:=20

		In this case only forking proxies/B2BUA would send 199.=20



		2.      UAS always sends 199:=20

		The issue with this alternative is that 199 would be
sent even if no forking has occurred - which can be assumed to be the
case in a large percentage of all calls.

	=09

		3.      UAS sends 199 if forking proxy does not support
199:=20

		With this alternative the forking proxy would have to
insert an indicator that it supports 199.=20

		Also, the UAS may not know whether it is the forking
proxy closest to the UAS that has inserted the indicator. This may not
be a big issues, since I assume in most forking cases there will only be
one forking proxy in the signalling path.




		4.      UAS sends 199 once procedures have reached a
certain state=20

		With this alternative 199 would not be sent until
certain actions have taken place on an early dialog=20

		Example: preconditions have been indicated as met=20
		Example: SDP answer has been sent=20

		The issue is that one would always have to specify at
what point of different procedures 199 would be sengt.=20



		5.      UAC and UAS negotiate sending of 199 once the
early dialog has been established:=20

		With this alternative that UAC would tell the UAS that
forking has occurred (could this be useful information also for non-199
procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be sent.

		The issues with this alternative is that it may require
additional signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't be sent for other
reasons) to inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

		Other alternatives?=20

		NOTE: Robert S also raised an issue on what Require: 199
means. But, I think that outcome of that issue may depend on what way
forward we choose for the issue in this mail.

		Regards,=20

		Christer=20

Yeah I was going to mention that but I thought it would seem almost hypocritical.  :)
But it's true really - the draft is about B2BUA's not changing a Session-ID they received.  It doesn't say they can't mint a new one if one was NOT received, and indeed I would expect that's exactly what they'd do if the UAC didn't do it itself.  It would make it less useful for some of the use-cases, but it's better than nothing, and hopefully the header is such a trivial concept that UA's would implement it.

If a B2BUA "combines" packages it learned from the dialog on its other "side" with ones it itself supports, then it better well know what they do and how to handle them - in other words the B2BUA itself should support them.  If the B2BUA does not support the INFO-package concept/mechanism in this new draft, and blindly passes on what it got from each side as just an unknown header, things should work ok end-to-end, in theory, depending on how much the B2BUA hides the dialogs from each other. (more on that later)

In your scenario the B2BUA is a Nortel PBX, which supports its own Info package.  Ergo it understands the new Info package draft, and should know what its doing.  As it stands right now the draft's scope ends at the B2BUA, because it ends at the UAS.  Are you thinking we should specify what a B2BUA should do?

First, the Cisco shouldn't barf. (though barfing does keep the weight down :)  It should reject the INFO, and in its response it gets a chance to put in what recv-info it does support, so Snom learns better.  That *is* your "Oh no you don't" re-learning exchange. :)

But I also don't understand how that could really happen to begin with, except for in one specific case.

The cases as I see them:
- If a B2BUA routes the call to Nortel, then Snom would get a Nortel recv-info.
- If it routes it to the Cisco, then SNOM would get a Cisco recv-info.
- If the B2BUA supported its own package, then one would think it would also eat the INFO requests for its own package and not forward them on.
- If the B2BUA forks the call as a proxy, the SNOM will get each recv-info on a separate early dialog, which is fine.
- If the B2BUA hides the details of the Nortel or Cisco dialog legs from Snom, I don't know how it would get the chance to tell Snom both packages at the same time to create such confusion, without knowing about this new Info draft thing to begin with.  It would have to know/understand the Info package draft to do such muxing/combining.  Once it knows the new draft, it would know to "route" the appropriate INFO message to the appropriate party, or reject it if that leg is gone.  No barfing.
- If the B2BUA moved the call discretely from Nortel to Cisco, and supported/understood this new Info-package draft, it would know it needs to update the Snom UA with the current packages in an in-dialog Invite/Update recv-info, because it truly no longer supports both packages.

- If the B2BUA moved the call discretely but did NOT know about this new Info draft thingy, then it could *indeed* be a problem if it blindly passed on the Nortel recv-info but not the later Cisco one.  And it wouldn't pass on the Cisco's recv-info only because it is hiding the dialog move from Snom.
However, send-info does nothing to prevent/help that.  And I should point out it is no worse than what we have now, which is manual configuration.
And it's no worse than a B2BUA blindly passing back Allow/Accept/Supported type headers for an initial dialog and not updating them later when it moves the dialog.
What the new draft DOES provide, is a way for Snom to learn the new info-packages supported by cisco when it sends a nortel INFO message and cisco responds with a different recv-info set.


> Is this an argument for Send-Info?  If UA-SNOM says, "Send-Info: DTMF,
> Nortel_Extra_Keys" to Cisco, Cisco can say, "Oh no you don't."

Again, the only case I can see Snom thinking X and the far-end UAS thinking Y is if something in the middle is hiding dialog changes.  If it's hiding those, then what triggers Snom to send a new send-info list, and what makes the B2BUA send that list to the Cisco?  Because whatever it is would just as well also mean Cisco gets a chance to send an updated recv-info list, and snom learns the change.
In the worst case, that happens when Snom sends an INFO cisco doesn't understand.

Am I not comprehending the problem case you guys are talking about?

Dan, Hadriel,

I don't think that having the first B2BUA synthesize the session-id
would work. The idea is to have it end-to-end to solve the problem so
having it put in by a B2BUA would not solve the problems.

The bigger issue is what is to stop a B2BUA either removing the
session-id or generating one of its own. While this draft proposes B2BUA
actions the defined actions will only occur if the B2BUA fully
implements this draft.

RFC 3261 defines a B2BUA as a concatenation of a UAS and a UAC. What
happens between the UAS and UAC parts is undefined and there is no
specification as to what actions the B2BUA should take when passing a
request from the UAS to the UAC. There was a draft presented to the
sipping wg to try an define actions of B2BUAs but this was rejected by a
hum as dangerous. I guess that the consensus was that the B2BUA should
remain totally undefined so that it could perform any action that was
required. [Declaration of interest: I was a contributor to this now
expired draft.]

Hadriel,

A couple of additional items which may need to be considered in the
draft.

Is it possible to include a list of headers which currently use the
existing dialog identifiers? Others which you have not mentioned include
Target-dialog, Join and In-reply-to.

Is it proposed to propose modifications to the RFCs for the existing
headers which use dialog ids to use the session-id?

It is probably necessary to specify B2BUA actions in cases of 3PCC and
what happens to the session-id in these cases.

For UAs that don't generate session-id the first B2BUA 
could synthesize a session-id.

Yes.  But until UAs generate the header, the best you can do is have
the first B2BUA insert the header for the benefit of the rest of the
SIP network.  This is akin to the 'authentication proxy' described
in RFC4474, where the proxy inserts the authentication headers if
the UA hasn't done so.

Nothing stops the B2BUA from doing anything it wants.

That is correct.

Is the draft complex to implement?

Hadriel's draft attempts to do the opposite:  instead of defining
"these are the things a B2BUA is allowed to do", it is saying "a 
B2BUA, compliant with this specification, will pass the session-id
header".

This is normal 3pcc transfer trouble, just like the problems of moving 
the media in such a case if the b2bua doesn't terminate media. That is 
why I called out this case earlier.

Its a little tricky when it doesn't know about the new draft. If it is 
switching the media then it will be doing a reinvite/update with the new 
endpoint anyway, and so will be getting a new recv-info. As long as it 
passes that transparently things should work out. Its more of a problem 
if it relaying the media, so that it doesn't intend to do a new o/a 
exchange, then its more problematic.

It *could* work, but there are a lot of "if"s.

The bottom line is that the b2buas will have to learn how to make this 
work. They will just need to get with the program and be ready before 
this stuff is deployed in endpoints.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Can you describe why having a B2BUA generate a Session-ID, if and only if one was not in the message already, would be worse than not generating one at all?

> While this draft proposes B2BUA
> actions the defined actions will only occur if the B2BUA fully

The draft doesn't say what a B2BUA should do if no header exists.  It does not say the B2BUA can not generate one in such a case.  I consciously left that as a possibility, knowing it would be a while before UAC's would generate one.

I'll tackle those in a separate email.

Funny you mention it - I was tempted to go do it in the draft, but I thought it wasn't really the place to do it because the list could change, and there're a bunch of proprietary ones too, and the goal of the draft isn't to change them.  So I figured it was better to just give a couple examples.  But I can certainly do it if you think it would be useful.

> Is it proposed to propose modifications to the RFCs for the existing
> headers which use dialog ids to use the session-id?

Nope.  If someone wants to propose that in the future that's up to them, but I'm not suggesting that for this draft.  I *do* think some of the XML packages that include them should consider the Session-ID as an alternative (not a replacement - just an alternative).  But only for the ones in draft status or proprietary ones, not published RFCs.


> It is probably necessary to specify B2BUA actions in cases of 3PCC and

Would it be any different?

Thanks for reviewing!

B2BUAs being able to generate a new header which contains a string 
correlated somehow (e.g. a hash) with the call-ID of the initial dialog 
would be, I think,  a good idea.   There are also two other drafts dealing 
with dialog correlation: 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-worley-references-00.txt which 
proposes the References-header, containing the Call-ID of the initial dialog 
and 
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-loreto-sipping-context-id-requirements-01.txt 
, discussing the requirements for dialog correlation. Both drafts have a 
quite different focus  but I do not see why we could not use/extend them to 
cover the B2BUA scenario.  The last draft is on the sipping agenda on 
Friday.

Laura

Nothing can stop a B2BUA from doing what its customer wants it to do.  Nothing can stop a UA or Proxy or Gateway from doing what they want to do either.  None of us are compliance angels, and the customers own the products, not the IETF.
All we can do is define a specification, and say what something that supports a mechanism must do to comply with the spec.  We can't force compliance on any product of any type, and there is no compliance police.

However, if we can show the value of complying to the spec, and don't try to make the device do what its customers don't want it to do, then it has a much better chance of being complied with.

And of course a B2BUA may simply just not implement/support this draft, just like a UA doesn't need to implement sip-outbound or gruu or ICE or a myriad of other IETF drafts/RFCs.

You mean the transparent-b2bua draft?  I don't remember what the consensus was in terms of whether it was specific to that draft or to anything about b2bua's.  I think there was concern about the type of things that draft tried to address, because it was suggesting behavior of B2BUA's that would potentially change currently deployed behavior, and its scope was rather large and people were worried about all the different types of things B2BUA's do and need to do that would need to be taken into account.

That's not the case for this Session-ID draft.

Yes.  But until UAs generate the header, the best you can do is have
the first B2BUA insert the header for the benefit of the rest of the
SIP network.  This is akin to the 'authentication proxy' described
in RFC4474, where the proxy inserts the authentication headers if
the UA hasn't done so.

[Ian Elz ] But there is no point having the B2BUA insert the header as
this doesn't solve the main problem, routing to the B2BUA where the
mapping occurred. 
Example: The UA which does not support the session-id will generates a
new request containing a Target-dialog with the existing dialog
identifiers. The problem of routing the new Request to the B2BUA which
inserted the session-id in the original request remains. If the original
request was forked then a Target-dialog using a dialog id would refer to
one forked dialog whilst the session-id would potentially refer to all
the forked dialogs. 

Unfortunately this is not as simple as inserting authentication headers
as authentication headers are only used by the one party to validate the
identity of the other party for the specific request. In this case the
session-id will be used in separate requests which reference other
requests. You need to ensure that you can route to the B2BUA which
inserted the session-id to map between the session-id and the dialog
identifiers. This is the problem that exists without the session-id and
this still needs to be solved.


> The bigger issue is what is to stop a B2BUA either removing the

Nothing stops the B2BUA from doing anything it wants.

[Ian Elz ] Agreed

That is correct.

Is the draft complex to implement?

[Ian Elz ] The part relating to passing a session-id transparently from
one side to the other does not appear difficult. The logic to map from
dialog-ids to session-id as discussed above is another matter.

Hadriel's draft attempts to do the opposite:  instead of defining
"these are the things a B2BUA is allowed to do", it is saying "a 
B2BUA, compliant with this specification, will pass the session-id
header".

[Ian Elz ] The previous draft was an attempt to define what things a
B2BUA should do to be as proxy like in the network. There were also
proposals as to how Requests containing the headers which reference
other dialogs are routed in the network.
The attempt was to define what things a B2BUA must do and which it
should not. I still believe that this needs to be defined.

Can you describe why having a B2BUA generate a Session-ID, if and only
if one was not in the message already, would be worse than not
generating one at all?

[Ian Elz ] I don't think that it will be worse but it won't solve the
problem. The biggest problem with the existing mechanism is that B2BUAs
map the call-id and tags (if they didn't then they would probably be
called proxies). The key issue when using the headers and event packages
which use dialog identities is that you need to route the new request
through the correct B2BUAs in the correct order to map the dialog
identity in the header or event correctly. If the session-id is inserted
by a B2BUA then the issue of routing a new request to this B2BUA still
exists.

> While this draft proposes B2BUA

> implements this draft.

The draft doesn't say what a B2BUA should do if no header exists.  It
does not say the B2BUA can not generate one in such a case.  I
consciously left that as a possibility, knowing it would be a while
before UAC's would generate one.

[Ian Elz ] Except that we are having a discussion about having a B2BUA
inserting a session-id.

I'll tackle those in a separate email.

[Ian Elz ] OK. This isn't an issue with the draft just an observation as
to what has happened in the past.

Funny you mention it - I was tempted to go do it in the draft, but I
thought it wasn't really the place to do it because the list could
change, and there're a bunch of proprietary ones too, and the goal of
the draft isn't to change them.  So I figured it was better to just give
a couple examples.  But I can certainly do it if you think it would be
useful.

[Ian Elz ] Personally I think that this would be useful (I keep finding
new ones hidden away). It would only be informative at the date of the
draft. I don't think that any proprietary ones should be mentioned, only
those in RFCs.

> Is it proposed to propose modifications to the RFCs for the existing
> headers which use dialog ids to use the session-id?

Nope.  If someone wants to propose that in the future that's up to them,
but I'm not suggesting that for this draft.  I *do* think some of the
XML packages that include them should consider the Session-ID as an
alternative (not a replacement - just an alternative).  But only for the
ones in draft status or proprietary ones, not published RFCs.

[Ian Elz ] OK. This is a problem for the future then. The existing
problems based upon the existing header definitions will and mapping of
the dialog identities will remain for the present. Until these changes
are done however the usage of the session-id will be limited.


> It is probably necessary to specify B2BUA actions in cases of 3PCC and
> what happens to the session-id in these cases.

Would it be any different?

[Ian Elz ] Possibly. In simple 2 party 3PCC then probably not. The B2BUA
can simply generate a session-id and pass it to the parties at both
ends. If you have a more complicated cases involving more than 2 parties
then there may be issues. I will look at these separately.

Thanks for reviewing!

[Ian Elz ] That's fine. I am looking at how the dialog mapping can be
solved in IMS and an end-to-end identifier was one option to be
considered. This gives me the opportunity to examine this option and to
have other people involved.

"Solving HERPF" in general does not appear to be something we are 
willing to do. 

However, having 199 carry useful information such as "why the 
dialog was terminated", to me, seems like something that ought
be allowed. 

PS: I think including the reason should be mandatory.

Nothing can stop a B2BUA from doing what its customer wants it to do.
Nothing can stop a UA or Proxy or Gateway from doing what they want to
do either.  None of us are compliance angels, and the customers own the
products, not the IETF.
All we can do is define a specification, and say what something that
supports a mechanism must do to comply with the spec.  We can't force
compliance on any product of any type, and there is no compliance
police.

However, if we can show the value of complying to the spec, and don't
try to make the device do what its customers don't want it to do, then
it has a much better chance of being complied with.

And of course a B2BUA may simply just not implement/support this draft,
just like a UA doesn't need to implement sip-outbound or gruu or ICE or
a myriad of other IETF drafts/RFCs.

[Ian Elz ] Agreed. B2BUAs are a world apart. They do have to support the
basic UAC/UAS functionality in RFC 3261, or at least they should. The
problem is that there is nothing which defines how they should behave to
any extent, e.g. passing on received headers etc, mapping Contacts if
Call-id or tags are mapped.

You mean the transparent-b2bua draft?  I don't remember what the
consensus was in terms of whether it was specific to that draft or to
anything about b2bua's.  I think there was concern about the type of
things that draft tried to address, because it was suggesting behavior
of B2BUA's that would potentially change currently deployed behavior,
and its scope was rather large and people were worried about all the
different types of things B2BUA's do and need to do that would need to
be taken into account.

[Ian Elz ] That's the one. I was not at the IETF when the draft was
rejected so I don't know what happened in the room at the time. I don't
think that the draft was trying to specify any specific behavior, it was
not Standards Track, but was recommending what types of things a B2BUA
should do to behave well in the network and the behavior to solve
specific problems, e.g. the dialog reference header mapping issue.
The scope of the transparent b2bua draft was large but the longer such
work is delayed the larger it becomes.

That's not the case for this Session-ID draft.

[Ian Elz ] Hopefully not. Specifying the header should not be a large
task. The hard part will be how it is used in specific network scenarios
and how it interworks with the existing mechanism based upon dialog ids.
If the draft gets pushed down that route then it could be a long haul. 
Has there been a sipping draft identifying a specific problem to be
solved and identifying requirements for this header?

Suppose, for the sake of argument, we go with Hadriel's draft and
OPTIONS, e.g., global call ID in INVITE request, sent back in OPTIONS
request with global call ID to URI obtained from receive From.

Now suppose the initial From URI is sip:+123456@example.com;user=phone
and this gets modified by callee's service provider to
sip:+123456@sp.net;user=phone. Callee UA sends OPTIONS request to the
latter URI. B2BUA in sp.net acts as UAS for the OPTIONS request and
returns 200 OK, on basis that it recognises the global call ID. What
does this give me? Basically that the call arrived via my service
provider, which I know anyway if it arrives over a TLS connection for
which I have authenticated the service provider. The problem is, I don't
know that sp.net has terminated the OPTIONS request. Even if the service
provider has not acted in this way and the OPTIONS request has gone all
the way back to the caller UA (or at least to its domain proxy/B2BUA), I
have no evidence that this is so.

Now contrast this with RFC 4474. With RFC 4474, sp.net can change the
URI as above and re-sign (insert a new Identity header field). At least
my UA can see that the only guarantee I have is that the call arrived
via sp.net. On the other hand, if sp.net has not intervened in this way
I can see where the call has really come from (subject to B2BUAs not
breaking the signature). In other words, RFC 4474 tells me who is
asserting that it sent the INVITE request, whereas DERIVE just tells me
that someone is asserting that it sent the INVITE request.

Right, but as I said this new Info-package draft does not make the problem any worse for this scenario than it already was.  And in fact it can make it better even for this scenario.  That's all we need to do.  I don't think there's a solution to solve this scenario for legacy or new Info usage, without having the B2BUA understand the draft, and once it does that we're ok anyway.

Ahh, but it will solve the problem far more often than not doing anything.  It will work for no matter how many hops after the first one - it just won't work if the new request gets routed *past* the first b2bua that created it.

So, for example:
Let's say your access SBC inserts it (or P-CSCF in IMS terminology).  It always works, because all requests going to the UA endpoint have to get through that node to get to the UA.

Let's say the proxy-registrar does it (the S-CSCF).  It always works, assuming you route requests to such a device before they get to the endpoint/UA.

Let's say the peering SBC does it (the I-BCF), or the app server, feature server, PSTN-gateway, whatever - it only works if the new request which needed the match is routed through that first Session-ID-inserting B2BUA; and that is *still* better than what we have now, which as you said is the new request has to flow back through the whole path.

maybe its also about the first B2BUA inserting one where there isn't 
(on the UAS back side), and not changing it on the UAC back side - 
then just in general about not having any subsequent SIP 
server/B2BUA/SBC changing a received session-id, maybe

Huh, I forgot there were other things. ;)

Fair enough - I'll add that in the next revision.

We'll also need to deal with scenarios where two calls are joined by a b2bua (e.g., out-of-dialog REFER/Invite with Replaces is terminated by a  middlebox).  Someone raised this issue over lunch.  I think it's not too hard to address unless one or more of the parties don't support Session-ID but others do, and that will be hard.  At some point they are logically two different sessions really.

Agreed.  I brought this up earlier in the week in
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg25640.html,
when I wrote:

   # If we had a way to determine who 'owns' an E.164, we 
   # could make that owner prove they received the DERIVE 
   # query (by asking them to encrypt something with their 
   # private key), which prevents a PSTN gateway from lying.  

(substitute 'PSTN gateway' with 'B2BUA'.)

   # This is something that could be bolted on later, 
   # if/when we figure out how to map an E.164 to 
   # certificate that 'owns' it.

and this is why draft-wing-sip-identity-media (expired) 
signs the originating information (as does Kai's draft).
Both would receive additional benefit from the ability
to associate an E.164 to a certificate.

At the end of the day it's just a form of return-routability test, subject to the same middle-box trust issues we already know and love.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, just that I don't think they're claiming it does anything more than that.

With regards to your specific scenario, you said with 4474 if sp.net did NOT interfere with the From-uri then you can verify where the call really came from. (example.com)  But if sp.net did not interfere with the From-uri, then Derive will also route to example.com.

4474 does not and cannot prevent sp.net from changing the From-uri to sp.net - it can only prevent sp.net from changing it to example.com, or foobar.com.  If sp.net changed it to foobar.com, Derive could catch that in some cases, but obviously if the Derive message just happened to go through sp.net then sp.net can successfully lie and make the Derive check succeed.  Whereas 4474 would catch the lie no matter what.

BTW, I think it still is subject to the Baiting attack.  I make a Bank call me, and I then re-use its call-id+tag in an INVITE I send to you.  Since it's the same call-id and tag, Bank will say "yes I'm making that call".

But I assume the purpose for Derive is not to try to prevent all kinds of middle-man/middle-box attacks, but rather prevent spray-spamming and some basic identity fraud scenarios in a better-than-nothing approach.  No?

[JRE] Yes, but how does the callee UA know whether this has happened or
not? How does it know who is making the assertion (in the OPTIONS
response) that it has indeed sent the INVITE request? With RFC 4474, the
subject of the certificate provides this information.

[JRE] But how would the re-attempted call to a specific branch be
achieved? What goes in the Request-URI - the received Contact URI? Then
presumably Route header fields would need to be added based on
Record-Routes from the previous dialog? Or if the Contact URI has GRUU
properties, I guess Route isn't needed. But what if a temporary GRUU -
would it still be valid?

[JRE] Personally I think this is a more compelling use case.

Consensus stuff:

1. Remove Send-Info. It takes away a bunch of race conditions. The  
value of having it is theoretical. We can always add it in later, so  
we will keep the header name "Recv-Info".

2. Remove Contact: header from INFO table

3. Remove Recv-Info from INFO table

4. Mention what happens when you forget the Recv-Info header when you  
refresh a dialog

5. Only one Info Package body in the INFO method request. However,  
implementations MUST support multipart, per RFC 3261 as updated by  
body-handling.

If you disagree with these items, squeak now.  Send us an INFO.

There was some discussion as to whether the registry for Info Packages  
should be Specification Required, Expert Review, or First Come First  
Served.

Specification Required today means that the specification requires  
expert review.

Expert Review means someone needs to give a cursory review of the  
registration application.

First Come First Served means what it says: send a note to IANA, and  
get a registration (with some basic review).

We can also have two trees, one Specification Required and one  
Private. This has been proven to be an interoperability and marketing  
nightmare, but I will put it out there for completeness.


I would offer we go with First Come First Served.  We can have a field  
for a reference, giving us the best of the specification required (you  
can look up what a published specification is) and Private (if you are  
creating a private Info Package, you do not have to specify anything  
other than the package name).

Please Vote:
[ ] First Come First Served with pointer to optional specification
[ ] First Come First Served
[ ] Specification Required
[ ] Expert Review
[ ] Two trees: Specification Required and Private

Do we want to specify media tags to indicate package support?

We had a long discussion about case sensitivity for Info Package  
names. The current text follows RFC 3265 and avoids charset and I18N  
issues, by mandating octet-by-octet comparison.

Some folks pointed out that RFC 3261 says that headers and header  
values should be case insensitive.

Please vote:

1. Keep case sensitive comparison, just like RFC 3265 mandates and  
experience shows promotes interoperability

2. Use case insensitive comparison, like RFC 3261 suggests

3. Keep case sensitive comparison, and tell IANA not to register  
multiple package names that might collide in the event someone does to  
case insensitive comparisons (liberal in what you receive)

I think I will abstain. I didn't realize that 3265 called for case 
sensitive comparisons. IMO it is the oddball among headers, but it is a 
good precedent here.

	Thanks,

My mistake: small typo.  #3 should be "Keep case INSENSITIVE  
comparison, and tell IANA not to register multiple package names that  
might collide in the event someone does to case insensitive  
comparisons (liberal in what you receive)."

So, we have for your choices:
1. Keep case sensitive comparison, just like RFC 3265 mandates and  
experience shows promotes interoperability

2. Use case insensitive comparison, like RFC 3261 suggests

3. Keep case INSENSITIVE comparison, and tell IANA not to register  
multiple package names that might collide in the event someone does to  
case insensitive comparisons (liberal in what you receive)

By the way, the reference for IANA Considerations is now RFC 5226. To  
whit:


       Private Use - For private or local use only, with the type and
             purpose defined by the local site.  No attempt is made to
             prevent multiple sites from using the same value in
             different (and incompatible) ways.  There is no need for
             IANA to review such assignments (since IANA does not record
             them) and assignments are not generally useful for broad
             interoperability.  It is the responsibility of the sites
             making use of the Private Use range to ensure that no
             conflicts occur (within the intended scope of use).

       First Come First Served - Assignments are made to anyone on a
             first come, first served basis.  There is no substantive
             review of the request, other than to ensure that it is
             well-formed and doesn't duplicate an existing assignment.
             However, requests must include a minimal amount of clerical
             information, such as a point of contact (including an email
             address) and a brief description of how the value will be
             used.  Additional information specific to the type of value
             requested may also need to be provided, as defined by the
             namespace.  For numbers, the exact value is generally
             assigned by IANA; with names, specific text strings can
             usually be requested.

       Expert Review (or Designated Expert) - approval by a Designated
             Expert is required.  The required documentation and review
             criteria for use by the Designated Expert should be  
provided
             when defining the registry.  For example, see Sections 6  
and
             7.2 in [RFC3748].

       Specification Required - Values and their meanings must be
             documented in a permanent and readily available public
             specification, in sufficient detail so that  
interoperability
             between independent implementations is possible.  When  
used,
             Specification Required also implies use of a Designated
             Expert, who will review the public specification and
             evaluate whether it is sufficiently clear to allow
             interoperable implementations.  The intention behind
             "permanent and readily available" is that a document can
             reasonably be expected to be findable and retrievable long
             after IANA assignment of the requested value.  Publication
             of an RFC is an ideal means of achieving this requirement,
             but Specification Required is intended to also cover the
             case of a document published outside of the RFC path.  For
             RFC publication, the normal RFC review process is expected
             to provide the necessary review for interoperability,  
though
             the Designated Expert may be a particularly well-qualified
             person to perform such a review.

Eric,

If an individual package requires an option tag, that option tag could
be defined in the RFC that defines the package, which would need to be
standards track. I don't think we need to say anything about this.

Similar situation for media tags, except that RFC would not need to be
standards track.

John

Can you say more? Why would it be more of a nightmare than FCFS?

IMO this is better than FCFS with pointer because it gives a higher 
degree of legitimacy to those with specifications, which provides an 
incentive to get that.

But I will make FCFS w/opt spec my 2nd choice.

In regard to adding a Session-Id to requests are not given one by the
UAC:

A B2BUA can add one, of course.  But a proxy can also add a header to
a request, and can remain strictly RFC 3261 compliant while doing so.

A larger problem is that this added Session-Id is not observable from
the "input" side of the B2BUA, meaning that the correlation between
the incoming Call-Id and the Session-Id can only be reliably extracted
from the B2BUA itself, which obviates much of the value of Session-Id.
However, the B2BUA can create a 100 response to the request that
contains the Session-Id header and can send it to the upstream
element.  This makes the added Session-Id manifest to any network
logging.

Which leads to the question of whether we want to include Session-Id
in responses as a matter of course (as we do Call-Id).

Also, given the intended ubiquity of Session-Id, a one-letter
abbreviated header name should be defined.

I see:

   8. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no specific security issues for this mechanism, beyond 
   those already applicable to SIP-based session signaling. [TBD]

   9.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document makes no request of IANA. 

And yet there are significant security considerations.  E.g.:

   The reason for specifying the mechanism, and its length, is to make
   it impossible to determine the manufacturer of the device which
   generated it by looking at its format or value.

And of course the entire *purpose* of the draft is to define a
standardized header, which is an IANA consideration.

This would be so you could use callerprefs to select which UA. Given the 
astounding popularity and ubiquitous implementation of callerprefs that 
probably isn't hugely important.

> Do we want to specify SIP option tags to require Info Package support?

I think I agree with John or whoever it was, that these can be specified 
on a per-package basis if desired.

	Thanks,

I agree with John here.

I would include an informative reference to RFC 3427 indicating that any
draft that requires option tags for a package would need to have the
status required for option tag registration.

The nightmare is the proliferation of X-mumble (e-mail), P-mumble  
(SIP), g.mumble, etc., especially when the experiment becomes standard.

I'd much rather have a registration that looks like:

Package Name     Contact                            Reference
keypress         SIP Work Group <sip@ietf.org>      RFCYYYY
coolpackage      Proprietary Co <foo@example.com>   none

(where RFCYYYY is some standards track RFC)



And then, someday we get

coolpackage      Proprietary Co <foo@example.com>   RFCZZZZ

(where RFCZZZZ is some Informational RFC or link to a stable document)


The multiple tree way gives us X-coolpackage at best and  
com.example.coolpackage at worst, which might make foobar.com not want  
to advertise example.com.  Plus the package name give us a hint to  
what it does...

Agreed

I do not see separate mileage in separate vendor trees. They only work
to me if we can grandfather some package off another package.

standard.=20
=09

	I'd much rather have a registration that looks like:

	Package Name     Contact                            Reference
	keypress         SIP Work Group <sip@ietf.org>      RFCYYYY
	coolpackage      Proprietary Co <foo@example.com>   none
=09
=09
	(where RFCYYYY is some standards track RFC)
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09

	And then, someday we get
=09
=09
=09
	coolpackage      Proprietary Co <foo@example.com>   RFCZZZZ
=09
=09
	(where RFCZZZZ is some Informational RFC or link to a stable
document)
=09
=09
=09
=09
	The multiple tree way gives us X-coolpackage at best and
com.example.coolpackage at worst, which might make foobar.com not want
to advertise example.com.  Plus the package name give us a hint to what
it does...

			I would offer we go with First Come First
Served.  We can have a field for a reference, giving us the best of the
specification required (you can look up what a published specification
is) and Private (if you are creating a private Info Package, you do not
have to specify anything other than the package name).

			Please Vote:
		=09

			[ ] First Come First Served with pointer to
optional specification

			[ ] First Come First Served
		=09

			[ ] Specification Required
		=09

			[ ] Expert Review
		=09

			[X] Two trees: Specification Required and
Private
		=09

	=09
		IMO this is better than FCFS with pointer because it
gives a higher degree of legitimacy to those with specifications, which
provides an incentive to get that.
	=09
		But I will make FCFS w/opt spec my 2nd choice.

Since 100 is hop by hop, that response will only be seen by the prior 
node. I'm not seeing the value in this.

Even if it were a 1xx that went all the way back to the UAC, the nodes 
that would get to see it would by definition be ones that don't 
understand it and so will not use it for anything.

Specifically, *subsequent* requests in the same dialog won't carry the 
same value, at least until the node that inserted the value is reached, 
if it is reached. And even then the same value won't be inserted unless 
the inserting node is dialog stateful. That argues for only having 
dialog stateful elements insert the header.

Ultimately, for it to be useful, the node that wants to make a reference 
must be aware of the value. AFAIK that is usually the UAC.

Those are interesting questions, but go beyond the scope of the draft.

My proposal is to add text about including the original response code,
but NOT specify procedures for solving HERFP problems etc.

Hi,

I'll add it to the draft.

Hi, 

Feature-tags:
-------------

>I agree with John here.

>I would include an informative reference to RFC 3427 indicating that
any draft that requires option tags for a package 
>would need to have the status required for option tag registration.

One option would have been to define an info feature tag which can list
package value, and each package could then specify a value.

E.g sip.info="dtmf-packkage, isup-package"

But, I am ok with John's proposal also, but I think we should add some
text as suggested by Keith.


Option-tag:
-----------

I strongly think we should define an option tag for info packages.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I probably missed it, but what is the justficiation for only one Info
Package body per INFO request?

Didn't we discuss it earlier, and came to the conclusion that it
wouldn't add any extra complexity?

...especially, as you say, one MUST support multipart anyway.

Regards,

Christer

Consensus stuff:

1. Remove Send-Info. It takes away a bunch of race conditions. The value
of having it is theoretical. We can always add it in later, so we will
keep the header name "Recv-Info".

2. Remove Contact: header from INFO table

3. Remove Recv-Info from INFO table

4. Mention what happens when you forget the Recv-Info header when you
refresh a dialog

5. Only one Info Package body in the INFO method request. However,
implementations MUST support multipart, per RFC 3261 as updated by
body-handling.

If you disagree with these items, squeak now.  Send us an INFO.

I agree with Dean that feature tags and option tags are two separate
things.

But, in the sip.extensin feature tag you will actually list option tags
:)

sip.extension="100rel, info-packages, almighty-199" etc.

Christer

There seems to be some confusion between media feature tags, as used in
RFV 3840/3841, and SIP option tags.

Option tags are used in Supported and Require, with a common application
being in Supported header fields sent in response to OPTIONS messages.
They describe which extensions are supported by the UA. I think we need
one for INFO packages, because INFO package negotiation is clearly an
extension to base INFO.


Feature tags, on the other hand, support selective retargeting in
proxies where the potential targets are discovered via REGISTER
operations. We may need this too.

Hi, 

>1. Remove Send-Info. It takes away a bunch of race conditions. The
value of having it is theoretical. We can always add 
>it in later, so we will keep the header name "Recv-Info".

Could someone explain those race conditions to me, or point to a thread
where they are described?

In SDP o/a, for example, I think the advantages of being able to better
describe also what-I-can-send capabilities would be more than
theoretical.

If we don't want to use two headers, we can of course have a single
header with direction parameters.

E.g; Info-Package: dtmf-package;sendonly, isup-package;sendrecv

I think we have historical examples on when adding restrictions,
withoout any really good reason, later causes problems.

Regards,

Christer

Hi John

actually I think this concern has been indirectly articulated -- IMO,
it falls in the better-than-nothing category: any man-in-the-middle
including those who are legitimately in the path (sitting on DNS servers,
sitting  on proxy servers) can provide misleading assertions.

A "honest B2BUA" should here IMO really not answer with 200 until it
propagated the DERIVE test to the other side, unless it has the
knowledge of DERIVE test. (say by having it completed on its own)

The key point is however, that we just can't neither prevent nor
detect man-in-the-middle misconduct with better-than-nothing security.
If a B2BUA decides to play dishonestly (in addition to "mechanical"
side-effects such as destroyed callid, which we may possible fix),
we can neither prevent  nor detect it with better-than-nothing
security.

Which I think turns us to the DERIVE question: are we interested
in better than nothing security?

In attempt to make your point a bit "compressed" -- the concern is that
someone along the path is answering on the end party behalf, right?

In which case the answers above would relate: with better-than-nothing
security we really neither can detect nor prevent MitM providing
misleading answers. IF a B2BUA decides to lie, pretend, answer without
knowing, etc., we can't do anything about it. IF a domain (as identified
by its DNS name) decides to deploy such a vehicle, it is its choice.
(probably not best for its reputation)

A way to see it is in both cases the DNS domain owners are the verification
instance, that  provide some assertions using the vehicles they have.
With  4474 you additionally know that the DNS domain owner is really him
on the grounds of the trust relationship you established with a CA. Both
mechanisms can provide  you with misleading assertions about the URI
(username can be lied-unverified-whatever, or the whole From could have
been completely different before signing). IMO the added value 4474 
gives you
is a trusted  party assertion that you are blaming the right DNS owner 
for not
playing fair about From HF.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Location Conveyance for the Session Initiation Protocol
	Author(s)	: J. Polk, B. Rosen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-12.txt
	Pages		: 46
	Date		: 2008-11-20
	
This document defines an extension to the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) to convey geographic location information from one 
   SIP entity to another SIP entity.  The extension covers end to end 
   conveyance as well as location-based routing, where SIP servers 
   make routing decisions based on the location of the user agent 
   clients.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Although the draft mentions a UUID as one option, it leaves the mechanism to be decided.  One thing we could do instead of UUID, for example, would be to make it a hash of the received call-id and local system/node ID and MAC or some such.  In other words take some non-volatile system data munged with the call-id, and hash it to get the 128 bits of output for the Session-ID header value.  That way a stateless proxy can re-generate the same value again for upstream and downstream requests and responses, without it compromising or being re-create-able just from the call-id value and giving a reason for folks to remove it.
But I'll have to ask some security folks about that.

$Id: draft-kuthan-sip-derive-00-rev.txt,v 1.1 2008/11/15 20:48:48 ekr Exp $

This document is intended to provide caller identification for SIP
dialogs without the use of RFC 4474 Identity. The basic principle is
that when Alice calls Bob, Bob initiates a dialog in the reverse
direction (using the RFC 4235 Event Package). This message is assumed
to be routed correctly in the reverse direction and thus provides
independent confirmation of the call to Bob.

This draft has only a very short security considerations, so it's
not clear what threat models it's intended to defend against.

CUT-AND-PASTE
However, unless I've misunderstood the design, there's at least
one significant attack, namely INVITE forwarding plus cut and
paste attack. This works as follows:

Alice            Attacker             Bob
-----------------------------------------
INVITE ------------->
                    INVITE ------------->
                    
<------------------------------ SUBSCRIBE
NOTIFY --------------------------------->

                    <------------- 200 OK
                    <------- RTP ------->

The attacker somehow convinces Alice to send him an INVITE. The
attacker forwards it to Bob, rewriting the request line and 
the SDP.  As specified by the draft, Bob then sends a
SUBSCRIBE towards Alice. This gets there and Alice responds with the
appropriate NOTIFY--because Alice actually is in-dialog with the
attacker. This NOTIFY looks OK, and Bob accepts the call, with Alice's
identity displayed in caller-id.

I believe this attack actually works as I've described it with the
examples shown in S 7.1, which don't contain any identity values in
the NOTIFY. However, one countermeasure you might try is to try
is to compare identity values, in particular the To line (remember
that you can't compare the URI in the request because those
can get transformed, hence the need for History). Unfortunately,
since call forwarding is a legitimate service, there are reasons
why the To received by Bob might not match what was in Alice's
original INVITE, so if you rely on this check you'll get a lot
of false positives, which seems problematic. 

Note that even cryptographic protection a la DTLS-SRTP doesn't help
here, because the attacker can simply rewrite that part of the SDP to
contain his own cryptographic parameters as well as whatever IP
addresses he wants to put in the SDP.  It's interesting to contrast
this with RFC 4474, which doesn't have this problem because the SDP is
integrity protected.  Of course, it would be possible to modify this
mechanism to provide protection against SDP modification by having
Alice provide the session description in the NOTIFY (S 4.1.6.3 of RFC
4235, I think). However, as I understand this design, it's explicitly
an attempt to avoid RFC 4474 full protection of the message.

Note that there's an even more obvious attack of this flavor from
one of the proxies, where it just modifies the media parameters. 
That's not really discussed in the threat model, but I'm assuming
the authors think they're designing hop-by-hop security here.


ATTACKING THE CONFIRMATION STAGE
The previous attack relied on attacking the INVITE and allowing
the confirmation stage to proceed unmolested. Another form of
attack is to attack the confirmation stage. Again, say that
the attacker wants to impersonate Alice. He sends an ordinary
invite to Bob's proxy with From: alice@atlanta.com. He then
uses DNS cache poisoning to hijack the connection to Atlanta.

Now, if Bob tries to use SIPS, this attack will fail, because
the attacker can't properly execute the TLS handshake with
Biloxi, but Biloxi and Bob have no way of knowing that Atlanta
can actually do TLS, so they can't safely insist on it, and
the attacker can always simulate being TLS-incapable if they
try opportunistic TLS. Note that this case is actually worse
than ordinary call hijacking because the attacker knows exactly
when Bob will do his DNS queries, which makes attacks easier.


HIGH LEVEL
It's probably useful to take a high level view of the matter.
Classically, we talk about two related security services:

1. Data origin authentication.
2. Message integrity.

This mechanism, like RFC 4474, is intended to provide both of these
services to some extent. In order to get DOA, we need the recipient to
be able to get *some* message that they can be sure was from the
sender. Once we have that, message integrity is a matter of tying that
single authentic message to the message to be protected.

With that in mind, while this system is completely different from RFC
4474, they occupy two points in a large and largely orthogonal design
space. I.e., the method of providing data origin authentication is
orthogonal to the method of providing message integrity and the data
to be protected. In particular, as noted above, it would be possible
to use a mechanism of this type to protect the entire message instead
of just pieces of it. Similarly, it would be possible to use RFC 4474
to protect only pieces of the message, as has been described in
multiple drafts.

As another example of this, consider a hybrid solution that uses 
S/MIME signatures but DOA via SUBSCRIBE (at least partly):

  Every node has a self-signed S/MIME certificate and signs all
  its messages. When a node receives a message from a node its
  never heard from before, it does a SUBSCRIBE to the sending
  node's certificate. Once it has received it, it can then
  verify all future messages.

It should be apparent that this mechanism has aspects of both the
RFC 4474 designs and this design. Moreover, one could choose to sign
all or only some of the message, further expanding the design space.

>From this perspective, this particular set of points in the design
space has two weaknesses:

1. The DOA mechanism isn't particularly strong (as indicated by
   the DNS spoofing attack described above). The problem here is
   that in order for it to work it requires a TLS path all
   the way to the (putative) sender. Since there's no guarantee
   of this existence, failures are hard to decode. Note that
   by contrast, RFC 4474 only requires the *sender* to have
   a certificate.

2. The message integrity mechanism doesn't cover enough of the
   message, making media hijacking attacks easy. Again, RFC 4474
   covers more of the message, blocking this sort of attack.

None of this is to say that there isn't room for another point
in the design space than RFC 4474. However, rather than randomly
selecting points in the space and trying them on for size, we
should try to figure out what we're trying to achieve on both
of these axes and then design specific mechanisms that achieve
these ends.

One thing we could do instead of UUID, for example, would be to make it a hash of the received call-id and local system/node ID and MAC or some such.  In other words take some non-volatile system data munged with the call-id, and hash it to get the 128 bits of output for the Session-ID header value.  That way a stateless proxy can re-generate the same value again for upstream and downstream requests and responses, without it compromising or being re-create-able just from the call-id value and giving a reason for folks to remove it.

Well, if there is already enough unchanging info that survives middle 
boxes, then we don't need the header - we can just tell everybody to use 
that.

Or, if you mean it is a hash of info that will then get munged, the 
header needs to be inserted by some box before the munging happens. And 
it still has the property that it is then only usable by those who are 
downstream.

I think the greatest appeal of an approach like the one in DERIVE, if it 
can be made to work, is that it requires no explicit support on the 
calling party's side. Ideally, we'd like something that I could go back 
to my office, code up, and begin using without waiting for anyone else 
to catch up. (I am, after all, the beneficiary of this behavior -- not 
the caller -- so I have a far greater interest in deploying something 
like this than they do). This proposal is not the result of picking a 
random point in the solution space and exploring its properties -- it is 
the result of actively seeking a solution with this precise property, 
and then examining what other properties it exhibits.

That said, the DERIVE approach has at least one major shortcoming if 
viewed as a mechanism in isolation: it allows you to ask the question, 
"does the AOR in this call  setup request correspond to the device 
calling me?," but the only answers you can get are "yes" and "maybe."

This does not mean that it is without use; it means that it is one input 
to a larger system at the called party's user agent. Ultimately, I fear 
that fighting unsolicited/unwanted communications in SIP will require a 
multi-pronged approach -- one that does not necessary require support 
for any specific mechanisms on the calling party's UA. That means we 
need an entire box of tools to handle various conditions. I think DERIVE 
is potentially a useful tool in that toolbox.

First of all, thanks to Eric for this extensive (whereby quite late...) 
review. Please find my questions inline.

I believe that the counter measure that you are proposing has already 
been adressed in the draft. Concerning call forwarding, we know that 
this is an issue. But I still don't understand why checking the To in 
the SUBSCRIBE should generate a false positive. In this case, Alice 
would refuse to reply to the SUBSCRIBE, as it does come from any party 
Alice has sent an INVITE to.

Could you please explain why you think that we are trying to provide 
message integrity (apart from the "From")?

Sure, and the question was if that inserting box could be a proxy.  The answer is yes, I think.  The generator of the Session-ID value should be the UAC, but can be any proxy or b2bua if the UAC did not do it.  The later the hop is in the path that does the generation, the less useful it becomes, but that's ok.

But that's ok.  It's better than what we have now - it works in more cases than what we have now, for cases where one or more b2bua's change the call-id.  If nothing in the path changes the call-id, session-id doesn't break anything.  That's why I was saying it would be used as an alternative not replacement for things - i.e., if you subscribe for a dialog-event package, you could include both call-id+tag and session-id, such that if call-id+tags didn't match on the UAS, then session-id could be checked as a last resort.  If the UAS or UAC doesn't support session-id, that last resort won't succeed or be used either; but that's no worse, and gives a chance for it to succeed which is better.

That's not totally accurate, methinks.  It requires support for the dialog-event package on the UAC, and requires the UAC to allow some random far-end UA outside its domain that it does not know about to subscribe to it.  [And it requires the path between the UAC and UAS to not contain b2bua's that change call-id or tag, of course]

The set of deployed devices/paths which satisfy those requirements is not the universe, but then again it's not the null set either. ;)

The problem here is the notion of "sent an invite to". When you try
to call my cell and it gets forwarded to my landline, you indeed
tried to call me, but you will refuse to confirm the call.

Right. You're providing minimal message integrity for the From 
(and, if you use the above countermeasure, the To).

I think you need to provide more than this in terms of explanation. What
interoperability issues do you think is solved by providing an option
tag for the extension itself, as opposed to individual packages?

Give us some valid scenarios.

Exactly. But that won't prevent you from answering this call. We can

I'm not quite sure this is correct. The From could even have been 
changed on the way. As long as the change is reverted back during the

I would call that a false positive. 

Pretty much *any* data origin authentication mechanism only gives you
one of two answers: yes or maybe, since it's always possible the 
signature/MAC/whatever was just broken along the way somehow.

This isn't some random far-end UA that the calling party has no reason 
to trust -- the dialog event package explicitly talks about 
authentication based on knowledge of the dialog identifiers.

Unless they also accommodate DERIVE. That's a known property of B2BUAs: 
you tend to need to update them whenever you want to do something new. 
Presumably, if the market asks for it, B2BUAs will address the issue.

Riiiight.  First, it was 28% at an earlier sipit and 16% at the most recent one - sounds like a massive decrease to me. ;)  But more seriously, in my experience the time between implementation and testing at sipit, and actual deployment in the field, is often measured in YEARS for anything but trivial features.  Obviously that's just my particular view, but my general point is it's a change on the UAC from TODAY, no matter how we spin it.

Ahh, ok.  My mistake.  So you'll only need operators to allow Subscribe's for such a package to get in from other domains. :)

As I've tried to explain, it is not technically possible for B2BUA's to "address the issue" to stop changing call-id's, because it's their customers who want them to change it.  You might as well ask them to stop being b2bua's.  DERIVE will not make that happen.

There are two such. The caller may have call forwarding setup --> DERIVE
test will fail. There is not much we can do about that. The other is callee
may have call forwarding setup and may wonder if To in INVITE can be used
for DERIVE test even though he is not registered under it. If he is consent
with using it (which he should be able to), the caller will receive
a legitimate DERIVE test. So what I really think may fail here is 
inconsistent
rewriting From/to by middleboxes.

Agreed. Generally there is no MiTM attack against which DERIVE is safe,
be it mounted on DNS or SIP.

By the SIP standard, the To URI shall remain unchanged, but if Call
Forwarding is deployed, Bob (bob@bobdomain.com) may wonder if it makes
sense to launch a DERIVE test with such a URI (bob@callforwarding.com).
That would be workable (I do have all my email addresses configured
in my central procmail too....)

What makes me more worried here is the B2BUA traversal. If TO is changed
and is not consistently translated for DERIVE query, we will get a negative
DERIVE test result.

--

This has not been really DERIVE's purpose, but it seems it would be
helpful for the WG to revisit the phenomena of B2BUA. (the kind of
study what they do, why they do it, what they break by doing what
they are doing, and how to fix it.)

I agree; the "DERIVE question" is primarily about whether we want
to have better-than-nothing security or not, and I think that's the
key question to ask ourselves.

Particularly here we are not really promising determining identity,
but cryptographically unsecured reverse routing check. We cannot
answer "who are you", but we can answer "where are you" (and still
have residual uncertainty because we don't use cryptography to
establish that).

I think this can be still useful provided we document well the
limitations. For some practical purposes, it is "good enough" -- say
if someone is using your URI in a request to me, this type of
check can detect the request as uncertain.

In the non-SIP world, I would compare it to SPF. In fact even SPF
could be a legitimate answer along the better-than-nothing security.
The key difference here is if we are interested in domain-level
or per-call verification granularity.

in this context, I think that DERIVE and alike can provide a weak
assertion for 1 and none for 2. (unless we combine those with
additional techniques, which would however weaken the promise
of simplicity)

well I think DERIVE is weaker in that does not give any real

I think the key point here is what you call DOA, and at the same time
simplicity. I think if we try to indirectly compare it to RFC4474
this is value small in size compared to RFC4474 (particularly if we
realize the limitations such as MiTM vulnerabilities) but promising
in use (it is easily deployable, has an adoption path, and can help
to sort out some attacks that are now way too easy to mount.)

The option tag is used in OPTIONS responses (and in Supported header  
fields in other responses) to inform a correspondent that the node in  
question supports this extension, potentially leading to a decision as  
to which behavior to apply to future requests.

It is also used in Require header fields of requests to cause the  
request to be rejected by any UAS that does not understand the  
extension.  This is potentially critical for applications that find  
themselves completely dependent on the extension.

One might ask whether this is critical; after all the INVITE exchange  
will tell us what info packages (if any) the far end is willing to  
use. What is the difference between not using INFO packages and not  
supporting them?

The answer is in the fallback to pre-package INFO behavior. A node  
supporting INFO packages will, IIRC (or at least "if I get my way") ,  
always use packages when sending INFO. A node not supporting INFO  
packages is likely to send old-style un-negotiated INFO, meaning you  
might need to be prepared with that behavior. Being informed (by  
Supported) which state applies might be useful.

You seem to be arguing that packages themselves may need to have option
tags, rather than the extension itself, which does not answer the
question I asked. 

What I asked was whether there was a need to have an option tag
specifically for the info-package extension.

There were no option tags for pre package info behaviour, so there is no
information to tell you that if I don't support the new extension that I
supported the previous incarnation of INFO. So I do not see how that can
be used for fallback.

regards

Keith

Yes. One would hope this is something they're compelled to do anyway, as 
it allows the simpler version of the call completion service.

I'm not saying "stop changing Call-IDs." It's true that that's what I 
*want* to happen, but it's not the only way this can be made to work.

I'm saying "if you must, for business reasons, change Call-IDs going 
into and out of a network, make sure you perform the same mapping into 
and out of the network when you see the dialog event package." Again, 
this is something with value for the carrier itself, as it allows new 
services (such as call completion).

   Although the draft mentions a UUID as one option, it leaves the
   mechanism to be decided.

In that regard, the draft is somewhat self-contradictory.  In one
place it mentions UUIDs and in another place, it specifies the
Session-Id as a crypto-random quantity.  But some UUID formats contain
the MAC address of the creator thereof, which violates the stated
security considerations.

   One thing we could do instead of UUID, for example, would be to
   make it a hash of the received call-id and local system/node ID and
   MAC or some such.  In other words take some non-volatile system
   data munged with the call-id, and hash it to get the 128 bits of
   output for the Session-ID header value.  That way a stateless proxy
   can re-generate the same value again for upstream and downstream
   requests and responses, without it compromising or being
   re-create-able just from the call-id value and giving a reason for
   folks to remove it.

You'll have to include in the hash a secret local key.  Otherwise an
adversary can check a guessed correspondence between a Call-Id and a
Session-Id.

   Since 100 is hop by hop, that response will only be seen by the prior 
   node. I'm not seeing the value in this.

   Even if it were a 1xx that went all the way back to the UAC, the nodes 
   that would get to see it would by definition be ones that don't 
   understand it and so will not use it for anything.

True, but I'm addressing a requirement that I haven't stated:
Enabling an "outside observer" to correlate network traces on the
various networks.  In practice, what you need is for the messages, as
captured in network traces, to carry enough information that you can
tell which messages are part of the same (logical) dialog.  The
Session-Id provides this information very nicely, as long as an
introducing middlebox-element emits some message on the input side
that reveals the input-side Call-Id with the Session-Id.

Hi Keith,

My proposal is that we define an option tag for the EXTENSION - like we do =
for most other extensions.

Whether we have a feature tag for the extension, or separate feature tags f=
or each package, has nothing to do with the option tag.

Regards,

Christer

 =

You seem to be arguing that packages themselves may need to have option
tags, rather than the extension itself, which does not answer the
question I asked. =


What I asked was whether there was a need to have an option tag
specifically for the info-package extension.

There were no option tags for pre package info behaviour, so there is no
information to tell you that if I don't support the new extension that I
supported the previous incarnation of INFO. So I do not see how that can
be used for fallback.

regards

Keith

Would be really interesting to see how the deployed border security  
devices allowed or disallowed subscribes to the dialog-event.

Perhaps, but I don't think we can hang on that. If there is market value 
for the work we do, they'll catch up. If there isn't, they won't. They 
serve business purposes -- which is both what makes them so ridiculously 
infuriating as well as what makes them highly likely to accommodate any 
specifications we product which have real-world utility.

That is not my intent. I'm talking about the use of option tags to say  
"Yes, I support the concept of info-packages" vs "I do not support the  
concept of info-packages".

yes, and that's what I tied to answer.

If I don't support info-packages, then I MIGHT support old-info. If I  
do, then I MIGHT understand an INFO (or the legacy set), and I MIGHT  
send you one (from the legacy set). But I'm very, very unlikely to  
understand any of the new CID-indirection-to-select-a-body, multiple- 
body stuff, so don't send it!

Ohhh.  But that's not the problem.  At least I hope that's not what people are talking about.  Most B2BUA's will map them back just fine.  The issue is your message may not go through *that same* B2BUA.
If the message is in-dialog, no problem.
If the message is out-of-dialog but uses the Contact-URI to route to, no problem (because the b2bua's replace that to be themselves). [note: gruu's can screw that up, but oh well]

The problem is if you send it to an *AoR*, such as the From-URI of another message, there's no guarantee it will go through the same sets of b2bua's to get fixed hop-by-hop.

But those B2BUAs are all in the same administrative domain. Given that 
fact, there are solutions to the problem, such as synchronized minimal 
state -- or, preferably, stateless reversible dialog identifier 
transformations. These things are pretty easy to implement at B2BUAs. 
And, if the market finds a use for the dialog event package, you'll need to.

I mean, really. You're smart. If someone offers you enough money to make 
this work in your product, you'll figure it out.

I agree Christain, it's a mess. I remain hopeful that the new info  =

Unfortunately they're not.
Alice calls Benny; Alice is in foo.com, Benny is in bar.com; foo.com b2bua sends it to pwned.com, which sends it to bar.com.  Benny then sends an out-of-dialog Subscribe to alice@foo.com.  There's no guarantee it will go through pwned.com on its way back there.
But anyway even just hitting a different b2bua at pwned.com will make it unlikely to work.  :(

Oh yeah that's fun.  We're nuts, not crazy. :)

We tried that - gets too big. (did I mention many devices appear to have finite header string length limits?)
Since this problem at some level is that the From-URI is being used instead of contact-uri, if you'd prefer we can also just munge the From-URI to identify the specific b2bua. Yuck. And it won't work if there are 2 pwned.com transit domains. And down the rabbit-hole we go...

Or we can go do this little thing like Session-ID. :)

Dean,

You don't need an option tag for this. After the invite, I can't send 
you an info package unless you have provided a Recv-Info for it.

	Thanks,

Sorry, but you seem to have a use case that is relying on the absence of
an option tag to tell you....

....absolutely nothing.

This really can't be so.

I may support a legacy info usage because I need to do so to 
interoperate with some class of devices that use it and don't do the new 
info stuff. That package works just fine, so there is no reason to 
define a new info-package for the same purpose. So that may not get 
done. Yet for new functionality I use info packages.

In such an environment I may well use a combination of legacy infos and 
info packages.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Okay, I'm willing to believe that.

What if I have an application that really, really requires info- 
packages, so I want the call to fail if you can't handle them?

Would this arise, or would it always be preferable to complete the  
INVITE exchange, then tear the call down once I find out that you don't?

Hi,

I still think we shall have an option tag for the extension itself.

Eventhough it does not gurantee that the UAS supports specific info
packages, at least you can use it to help finding a UAS which supports
the extensions (by using the sip.extensions feature tag).

And, as Dean said, it can be used with OPTIONS.

Regards,

Christer

Dear the RFID trail participants:

We appreciate your corporation for this experiment.
After the Ecrit session, I'd like to collect the RFID cards. If you  
come to the SIPPING session tomorrow, it would be also fine to return  
the card to the chair desk  in the beginning of the session (not at  
the end).

Thanks,
Kumiko

No, you use the options tag with a sip.extensions media feature tag  
ala RFC 3840 in order to get a retargeting proxy to send the request  
only to the subset of UAS that support the extension.

>I just don't get how getting selectively to UAs that support *some*
info package is useful for anything.

Well, it's better than choosing a UA which doesn't support any packages.

But, of course additional feature tags would be needed in many cases.

In any case, I don't see why it would be such a big deal to define an
option tag, like we do for other extensions.

Christer

[JRE] I haven't heard a compelling argument for this. Keep it simple.

[JRE] This might arise on a per-package basis, in which case the spec
that defines that package can also define the option tag. I can't see it
arising in a package-independent context, so we don't need an option tag
for the extension as a whole.

PLEASE try to keep this extension as simple as possible - this option
tag / media feature tag business adds complexity. Are we really trying
to dissuade people from implementing this extension?

[JRE] RFC 3841 does not compel a proxy to behave in this way, and in
fact the proxy might not even support RFC 3841. So you have to be
prepared for your INVITE/Recv-Info to go to any UAS. I don't in general
see a need to specify this as part of the extension in general, but if a
particular package needs a feature tag, let it define one. Keep the
extension simple.

RFC 3840/3841 can insure such behavior, and (with Proxy-require) can  
assure that the proxy either supports the extension or  rejects the  
call.

well, it MIGHT do so, and fail in a predictable way as a consequence  
due to the Require: info-package. That's not a bad thing.

Only standards-track RFCs can define SIP option tags under RFC 3427,  
and we have no plans to relax this requirement.

But we have a much looser policy for INFO packages; most will not be  
standards-track.

So, for those sorts of packages, an info-package option tag is  
potentially quite useful.

Don't flatter me - if I was smart I'd be retired.

And my marketing brain tells me the features that need a call-id match aren't important enough to make a complicated solution worth the expense, especially if they work most of the time today because the ends aren't many domains apart if any.  Once a deployment works, the guys trying to get a new feature to work or a new box into it have to make their stuff work with the deployed systems, not the other way around.  But I fear when peering grows and calls go across more domains, that stuff won't work across them; and I think we all need voip peering to work to grow voip traffic, for all of our business models.

So I'm proposing a simple solution: Session-ID.  It's trivially simple, cheap to implement, useful for several things, incrementally deployable, and it should work for a majority of cases.  It's not a novel idea: some of us create similar things in proprietary ways/places right now to handle some of the same use-cases.

I know adding yet another header sucks, and adding more matching options for already implemented stuff is even much worse.  It's a big deal. But it would be to all our advantage I think.(?)

Correct - I noted that before on the mailing list before submitting the draft that we wouldn't use the UUID based on MAC, but rather the pseudo-random one.  But I'm not tied to it being a UUID at all whatsoever - it was just an example - it's TBD based on WG input.

Yup exactly - that's what I meant by not being "re-creatable", and why I included a system/node ID and MAC into the equation.  Not really a secret local key per se - and maybe I should just say that instead in the draft.

Note the "adversary" so to speak is just that a downstream node can get a Call-ID and must not be able to tell from the Call-ID it got, what the Session-ID should be, so they can't tell the Call-ID was changed by a b2bua.  Of course an upstream node would be able to tell - for example the UAC would if it received a subscribe for the dialog-event that had a session-id it created, with a call-id+tags it didn't.  But then one of the main points of this exercise is to make those cases work.  I can't guarantee that all operators would want it to work in such cases, but for those that don't want it to, nothing will help us make it work.

James, Brian,

I had no time to look at the new changes of the document, but I think
the Content-ID header in the samples is missing an angel bracket
according to RFC 2329:

Content-ID: target123@atlanta.example.com

shouldn't that be

Content-ID: <target123@atlanta.example.com>

?

John,

What is "un-simple" by defining an option tag value??? We have done that
many times before...

I'm not convinced we can paper over that problem so easily. There is a
tradeoff here in terms of business value for implementing the feature
versus increased risk of allowing the subscribes. We are not talking
about some small benign event package specifically designed for this
problem - we are talking about the mighty dialog event package. Once you
start allowing subscribes for this through into your corporate network,
you are only a minor bug or two away from a very embarrassing leak of
information.

Even if your border gateway sees what it considers to be a completely
reasonable and well-formed SUBSCRIBE (by whatever means it chooses), you
still need to trust the terminating UA[1] to correctly act upon the
filter, and not start a long-lived subscription to leak information
about all calls made in the next hour or so.

Not everyone will see the tradeoff the same way, but there is a
reasonably compelling case to say that leaking your CEO's call history
isn't a reasonable price for helping someone else's screening technique
say 'yes' rather than 'maybe'.

I, like Cullen, would be interested to see how deployed border security
devices react to subscribes to the dialog event package.

Best regards,

Michael


[1] This includes your CFO's really old phone that can't be upgraded,
because the last time it was touched, all the speed-dials for the
accountants were lost. It also includes your CTO's phone that is so new
and shiny it hurts. It downloads the latest firmware before the vendor
has even marked it as alpha. Needless to say, both phones take a
somewhat idiosyncratic view of SIP.

[JRE] Why will it fail? Call forwarding applies to the handling of
INVITE requests. SUBSCRIBE requests are not necessarily handled the
same, although I imagine that many implementations may do so, and
therefore your deduction is probably correct in many cases, but not
necessarily all cases.

Jiri,

Well, you could argue that P-Asserted-Identity is btn security - you
simply have to trust the chain of SIP intermediaries without having
visibility of who exactly is in that chain. I am not convinced that
DERIVE, either in its current documented form or taking into account the
many helpful suggestions during the last couple of weeks, can really
claim to add very much.

The fact that the mechanism can yield a significant number of "false
positives" (or perhaps "false negatives" is the right term) means the
mechanism, as it stands, fails to provide a safe means by which I can
decline or ignore calls I don't want, or send them to voicemail if I
don't want them right now. I think this limits its applicability.

One particularly appealing aspect of DERIVE as documented is that it
tries to avoid special behaviour at the calling side, as noted during
the meeting. So I would still appreciate any further ideas that have
this same property.

I appreciate your efforts on this and, believe me, I really want to
explore all possible ideas for solving this identity problem. So don't
let the absence of success with this discourage you from submitting
other ideas.

John

Christer,

OK, it might be simple, but still unnecessary, so why do it. I haven't
heard a compelling argument in its favour. Per-package option tags are
far more compelling (depending on particular needs of a package),
although I agree such packages would need a standards track document.

For that to be useful, each package would need its own option. While I 
guess we could define things such that each info-package registration 
implied a corresponding option tag registration, then that would be an 
end-around of the standards-track requirement for defining option tags. 
We really don't want that, or we will have people defining info-packages 
they don't intend to use, just to get an option tag.

You mean this in the sense of "what their owners configure them to do", right?  Not in the sense of "whether the border devices could or could not pass it through".  I mean most if not all SIP border security devices that I know of that have real SIP control intelligence can be configured to block or allow subscription to the dialog-event package, or have it on their roadmaps if not already. (and by real SIP control intelligence I don't mean firewalls)  But I have no idea how many are configured to block vs. allow it in the field, and would love to know the answer as well.  I bet it's not many, because the package is not used much yet.

The IESG has received a request from the Session Initiation Protocol WG 
(sip) to consider the following document:

- 'A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies '
   <draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-05.txt> 
   as a Proposed Standard

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action. The framework described in this
specification is designed such that SIP call control elements, including
proxies and SBCs, can assert policy to control session policies such as
what codecs an UA is allowed to use for a given session, amount of
bandwidth allowed, and to "steer" the media through particular relay
points. If people feel this draft is not an appropriate framework to solve
theses problems for SIP sessions, or feel that alternative mechanisms 
other than the types contemplated in this framework need to be 
developed, the IESG would like to receive comments on that. Please send
substantive comments to the ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by 2008-12-05. 
Exceptionally, comments may be sent to iesg@ietf.org instead. In either
case, please retain the beginning of the Subject line to allow automated 
sorting.

The file can be obtained via
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-05.txt
IESG discussion can be tracked via
https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi?command=view_id&dTag=15389&rfc_flag=0

I accidentally went home with the RFID card. Can you provide a mailing 
address for me (and likely others) to mail them back to you?

Thanks,

I agree with John. There is no compeling reason to include an option tag. An info-package that actually needs an option tag would need to be defined in a standards track document.

Keep it simple.

Less is more.

Christer,

OK, it might be simple, but still unnecessary, so why do it. I haven't
heard a compelling argument in its favour. Per-package option tags are
far more compelling (depending on particular needs of a package),
although I agree such packages would need a standards track document.

John

Hi,

I agree that we don't need to define option tags for each info-package.
>From a SIP perspective the extension (indicated by the option tag) is
the capabilty of transporting info-packages, not the info-packages
themselves.

Regards,

Christer

For that to be useful, each package would need its own option. While I
guess we could define things such that each info-package registration
implied a corresponding option tag registration, then that would be an
end-around of the standards-track requirement for defining option tags. 
We really don't want that, or we will have people defining info-packages
they don't intend to use, just to get an option tag.

	Thanks,

Just keep the cards until the next IETF. (You are now a card-carrying  
member of the IETF...) We'll probably repeat the experiment, unless it  
was more trouble than it's worth.

So here's a scenario to play against. It's not exactly in the scope of  
DERIVE, although one might see DERIVE as a defense.

I crate a CA cert claiming to be for "elwell.org" and use it to sign a  
cert for "sip.elwell.org".

I then generate INVITE requests for everybody on the SIP mailing list,  
with RFC 4474 Identity headers signed by "sip.elwell.org" and send  
them off UDP. Not from a real SIP UP, but from a simple harassment  
program.

How many phones ring straight away? How many other people are going to  
look at the cert, presume you are a reasonable guy to be getting  a  
signed request from and accept the call?

How do existing identity mechanisms protect against this? What other  
mechanisms might be operationally used to check it?

Remember, with BTN security, we're talking "things that keep basic  
script kiddies from being annoying", not "things that defeat somebody  
who can cache-poison DNS" (although there may be some script-kiddies  
doing that these days).

I agree with John too.  I don't see the benefit.  It would be beneficial to have one for a specific package, for example dtmf, maybe, but not the mechanism.  It's like having an option tag to support the Allow/Accept/Supported headers, as opposed to their values.  This draft is basically just a negotiation mechanism and defining how to handle things - not the things themselves.

We'll still have the method name "INFO" for the Allow header, if you want to say you can't do INFO requests.

The answer to that is simple: will you pay for the calls?

If you need to do some generic non-standards track info-package, how  
do you quickly weed out all the old phones that don't do info-packages  
at all?

Pay? I have yet to pay (beyond the basic transport cost) for a SIP

You create an option-tag for the specific package.  Weeding out the "old phones" won't be enough, because many new phones won't do your package anyway.  Such a shotgun approach is kinda useless.

John,

>So don'tlet the absence of success with this discourage you from submitting
>other ideas.

I beg to differ. In an Internet environment or in SIP VoIP networks that have little PSTN heritage constraints and/or long chains of interemediaries, Derive is very useful. I would suggest therefore Derive to be published as an informational RFC and to state in what type of networks it is most effective.

Thanks, Henry

Jiri,

Well, you could argue that P-Asserted-Identity is btn security - you
simply have to trust the chain of SIP intermediaries without having
visibility of who exactly is in that chain. I am not convinced that
DERIVE, either in its current documented form or taking into account the
many helpful suggestions during the last couple of weeks, can really
claim to add very much.

The fact that the mechanism can yield a significant number of "false
positives" (or perhaps "false negatives" is the right term) means the
mechanism, as it stands, fails to provide a safe means by which I can
decline or ignore calls I don't want, or send them to voicemail if I
don't want them right now. I think this limits its applicability.

One particularly appealing aspect of DERIVE as documented is that it
tries to avoid special behaviour at the calling side, as noted during
the meeting. So I would still appreciate any further ideas that have
this same property.

I appreciate your efforts on this and, believe me, I really want to
explore all possible ideas for solving this identity problem. So don't
let the absence of success with this discourage you from submitting
other ideas.

John

I want to make sure we're not going to re-hash all the call-id/to-tag 
mess some of use have had to live through already. Exactly what 
properties do you need this identity to have? For example, with your 
current draft, if the call forks to two automata that answer 
immediately, you'll end up with two valid sessions with the same 
"Session-ID." Is that what we want? If so, the term "Session-ID" is 
something of a misnomer. Perhaps "Session-Group-ID"?

But that requires the specific package be a standards-track RFC. Many

Not exactly. If I know you don't support info-packages at all, I can  
readily presume you don't support any specific info-package, including  
those non-STD-track packages that can't possibly have their own SIP  
options tag.

Having discovered via OPTIONS that you support info-packages, I could  
then decide to offer the specific package needed in an INVITE. This  
can weed out a lot of abortive calls.

Without the info-package tag, I can't use OPTIONS to decide whether or  
not you support info-packages, and must probe with a real-live INVITE  
(which could make things a bit strange with lots of ring-answer-hangup  
calls).

Sure, if every UA supports info-package as a concept this isn't  
useful. But in a transitional phase (which is what we have) where a  
great many UAs are not supporting it al all, it's better than a call- 
and-hangup probe.

I agree heartily.

As you will see below, although SIP had intended to take advantage of
the infrastructure provided by the Secretariat to have an interim
meeting in Malta, that infrastructure has now disappeared.

Therefore there will not be a SIP interim meeting in Malta.

We did have support for having both a SIP and SIPPING interim meetings,
and some work to address to an interim. We could still have an interim
meeting if we could find someone to provide a location. However time is
getting pretty short to do this.  

If you have any ideas in this regard then please contact us.

regards

Keith

WG Chairs:

Thanks for all of the valuable input.  The IAOC has just taken a vote,
and the Malta Large Interim Meeting Experiment in January 2009 is not
going to take place.  The primarily reason for this decision is the
number of people that are able to commit to on-site participation.  The
total number of people that indicated that they would attend is less
than 60.  That does not qualify as a large Interim Meeting.  With this
level of participation, we will not learn the things that we had hoped
from the experiment.

Please direct anyone that purchased a non-refundable airline ticket for
the proposed Malta meeting to me.

The IESG may revisit the idea of a Large Interim Meeting Experiment in
the future.  At this point, it is unclear when travel budgets will make
this a viable experiment.

I encourage WG chars to experiment with virtual interim meetings.
Guidance about interim meetings can be found at
http://www.ietf.org/IESG/STATEMENTS/Interim-meetings.txt

Thanks for all you do for the IETF and the Internet,
    Russ

I heard some people had bought tickets for the meeting already. I  
presume you didn't get direct-to-Malta flights. Where did you plan to  
change planes? Maybe we could get a facility there for the same dates?

No it doesn't, not in practice.  Only in some theoretical fantasy world.  We're talking about a vendor who makes a proprietary package, and doesn't want it to be used in general.  You think a vendor who does that, and needs to have a way to have endpoints Register the fact they can do it in a Supported header, or needs a way to check if the far-end does it in an Options, will say "oh gee I wish I could put something in the Supported and/or Require header but the IETF won't let me"??  You guys crack me up. :)

And don't get me wrong: I don't mean this in the sense that we should give up specs because people don't follow them.  I just mean that the use-case you're specifically talking about is a *vendor-proprietary* use-case, so why should we go provide some standard means to help them make it more easily deployable with themselves, if the means to do so already exist in a proprietary fashion *without* interop problems with those of us who follow the specs?  Because putting an unregistered option name in Supported/Require should work with the same semantic behavior registered ones do no matter who you talk to.  Unless someone has gone and built a box that does lookups against IANA databases every time it gets a message with an option tag it doesn't recognize and rejects it if not. ;)

All we have to do for vendor-proprietary users of INFO is make sure they interoperate with those of us who don't have them, by letting them discover we don't support them. (which is what recv-info does)  We don't need to work to give them more features.

Frankfort on the way there, London on the way back. So, what... meet in 
Brussels?

This is a corner case. If you require info-packages to make a call work, it sounds to me that whatever you are sending in the info is not appropriate for info and ought to be separate stream described in the SDP.

Well you seem to be arguing for the need for an option tag in a Require
header field rather than in a Supported header field. These are a
barrier to interoperability and therefore need to be very carefully
considered. 

The basis for your argument still seems to be very much: lets define one
because I might want one in the future. Conversely it might be: I need
an option tag but its use will be so perverted that I do not dare tell
the IETF community about it.

You won't, and if you do nothing we do will prevent it.  As you said, most devices won't do Info-packages to begin with.  If a vendor who makes a proprietary info package creates it in such a way that call attempts fail if the other side doesn't do their info-package, then they're way too dumb to put a generic info-package option tag in Require header anyway.

And again, having it for the generic info-package concept won't be good enough either - as soon as you support any info-package at all, then all of the sudden their call attempts start ringing and failing because you don't support their specific proprietary one.

No weirder than requiring support for automatic answering mode.

An option tag, once defined, can be used in Require, Supported (in all  
requests, probe with an OPTIONS), and in RFC 3840/3841 caller  
preferences/callee capabilities selective routing.

I like that idea - I found a $700 r/t for Frankfurt. And, I'm guessing
that within a few weeks AA will have more European specials. Also, given
the potential headcount, it seems the size of facility we might need is
not so large - I wonder if we could get someone to host at a corporate
location.

I heard some people had bought tickets for the meeting already. I
presume you didn't get direct-to-Malta flights. Where did you plan to
change planes? Maybe we could get a facility there for the same dates?

Hi Brett,

Thanks for you comments! See inline. 

------

>Section 4 paragraph 4:  Concerning "the client SHALL discard the 199
responses", is "SHALL" too strong since 100rel may 
>be used?  The strength of "SHALL" is likely only an issue if 18x did
not contain 100rel and 199 did.

Two alternative solutions that I can thin of:

1. If the 199 is sent reliably, the UAC simply discard it until it has
received the 18x, after which it deals with it. 

2. If the 199 is sent reliably, the UAC PRACKs it even if it has not yet
received the 18x.

------

>Section 4 last paragraph: The use of "will act" should likely be
changed to reflect an RFC 2119 defined word.

Is "shall behave" more suitable?

------

>Section 6 paragraph 2 first sentence: The use of "proxy MUST generate"
>should likely be downgraded to SHOULD or MAY too clearly allow the
proxy to avoid sending 199 when forwarding to server 
>expected to answer quickly (such a voice mail server).

Even if the proxy forwards the call to a voice mail server, the voice
mail server will establish a different dialog with the UAC than the
dialog which the UAS, from where the proxy received the error response,
established.

------

>Section 6 paragraph 2 last sentence: Since using another's To tag when
sending the 199, the draft should mention
>something concerning headers Contact and Record-Route.  If proxy
chooses not to add them, a missing Contact and Record-
>Route will not be an issue for UAC; however another proxy (not
supporting this draft) may be surprised to see their
>Record-Route entry missing.

Two alternative solutions I can think of:

1. We mandate a forking proxy which supports 199 to store the C/R-R
information received from the UAC, in order to insert it in any 199 it
generates for that session.

2. We say that IF the forking proxy stores the C/R-R information
received from the UAC, it shall insert it in any 199 it generates for
that session.

------

>Additionally since this draft defines a 1xx with To tag which does not
create a dialog (unless section 4 paragraph 4 
>modified), does this draft update RFC 3261?

Since the 199 is sent on already established dialogs, it does not create
a new dialog. Of course, if the 199 passes the dialog establishing 18x
(or the 18x is sent unreliably and gets lost) an entity not supporting
199 may establish an dialog. I would prefer to document that case
instead of updating 3261 :)

------

>Section 7: Concerning "MUST reply to such requests with a 481", the
text should likely defer behavior to RFC 3261 
>concerning receiving requests with To tag associated terminated/unknown
dialog.

Robert S commented on the same text. I could modify it to say:

"If such request is received by a UA, it shall act in the same way as if
it had received the request after sending the final non-2xx response to
the INVITE, as specified in RFC3261."

------

>Sections 9 and 10: Concerning the "MUST NOT"s related to SDP, should
they be downgraded to a "SHOULD NOT" to still allow 
>offer/answer compliance if desired?

I see no reason for that. Since the dialog is terminated, there is no
need to insert an SDP offer/answer.

The point is not that it possibly may succeed. The point is that it
possibly may fail because symmetric forwarding is simply not guranteed.
Therefore we know positive DERIVE tests provide us with value, negative
don't.

Hi Robert, 

(I will comment the minors in a separate reply)

------

>Major:
>maj-1) Do we have a constituency willing to finish this work? It has a
ways to go and the number of commenters has been 
>pretty small. Does anyone know of any attempts to implement this yet?

I am aware of plans to implement it.

------

>maj-2) -02 is an improvement over -00, but the basic architectural
intent is still not clear (as evidenced by the 
>remaining open issue in section 5 - in fact I think this is the _REAL_
open issue that the thing in section 5 is 
>pointing to). An implementer would probably benefit from a short
overview section that outlined the mechanics.

I agree that it currently is THE open issue. One proposal, based on
input from Bret (see separate thread) would be to say the following:

"A UAS must send 199 if it establishes more than one early dialog, and a
UAS may send 199 if it establishes a single dialog."

That way I don't think we need to distinguish between endpoint UASs and
B2BUAs. 

I've also mailed to other alternatives to the list, which I intended to
present at the meeting.

------

>maj-3) The document defines an option tag but doesn't say what it means
if it shows up in a Require: header.

I think we could say that it means that the UAS must support 199.
Whether it then actually sends 199 depends on whether it fulfils the UAS
criteria for sending 199 (see maj-2).

------

>maj-4) The Security Considerations section is empty. I've pointed
already (in my comments to -00) of at least one 
>situation we need to discuss here (It said "For instance, I can spoof
199s to affect how a call is ultimately answered

>other response manipulation.) We need some focused discussion to
uncover any other issues this new behavior is bringing 
>to the system.

I will initiate a separate thread for this.

------

>maj-5) (I waffled on putting this into minor, but I've made this
comment before and it hasn't been sufficiently 
>addressed). The document needs to be more explicit in explaining how it
might be that a single 3-6xx response showing up 
>at a proxy might cause it to send more than one 199. Something like
http://www.nostrum.com/~rjsparks/example.png
>perhaps.

I will take a second look at that.

------

>maj-6) The document should discuss what a proxy should do if a 199
shows up for an early dialog it's already generated 
>its own 199 about.
>(This might happen, for instance, if a 3-6xx and a 199 crossed on the
wire or were reordered by previous elements on the 
>way to this proxy).

If the 199 is sent reliably I guess the proxy could forward it, in order
to the UAC to PRACK it.

If the 199 is sent unreliably I guess the proxy could discard it, or
forward it.

But, I need to think about this a little more.

-----

>maj-7) Section 7 on backwards compatibility is really confusing and
doesn't stand up against some edge situations. In 
>particular, it doesn't act right when a request comes in that's a
retransmission or a merge. It could also be

together in the hall at IETF73 and collaboratively 
>wordsmith a replacement for this section.

I guess we never got a chance to discuss this, but I think I understand
your point. I guess I could modify the text, and simply say that a UAS
which receives a request after it has sent 199 shall act in the same way
as if it had received the request after sending the final non-2xx
response to the INVITE, as specified in RFC3216.

"If such request is received by a UA, it MUST reply to such requests
with a 481 final response."

...is replaced with:

"If such request is received by a UA, it shall act in the same way as if
it had received the request after sending the final non-2xx response to
the INVITE, as specified in RFC3261."

-----

>maj-8) What is the purpose of section 8? I suspect it should just be
deleted.

I took it from another draft (don't remember which) that defines a new
response code.

-----

>maj-9) Section 9 allows a 199 to contain SDP. Why? This document should
either forbid that practice or explicitly 
>document why it is allowed.

I am fine with disallowing it completely.

-----

I'll do the fixes in the next version of the draft.

Thank you very much for your comments!

I wonder sometimes if we didn't screw up making any registered option tag automatically usable in both Supported and Require.  Developers or product managers seem to not understand that putting something in Require means the call attempt will fail sometimes, and that users and operators are really really unhappy if call attempts fail.
100rel, for example, is sometimes put in Require with dire unintended consequences.

I think that is bad mojo.  You don't want calls failing just because a b2bua or the far-end UAS doesn't support 199.  What recourse would there be for the UAC?  What would the UAC do if it got a 420 response because of it?  It would make the call again without the 199 option tag in Require, or worse it would fail the call and the user will call tech support - because nothing is going to change when they make another call attempt with that option tag in Require.  And that is basically the definition of when NOT to put something in Require, but rather in Supported.

IMHO the draft should say a UAC MUST NOT put the option tag in the Require header.  If there's some reason some UAC has to do it, they'll ignore the MUST NOT anyway.  But they should think long and hard before making that mistake, and someone who buys their product should be able to complain to them that they don't comply with the RFC.

I'm almost tempted to say we shouldn't even have an option-tag at all (the Supported lists are getting quite big), but I'm guessing we'll have interop issues without it because some UAC's will barf on receiving a 199, so the UAS needs to know if it can send it. :(

...which is a good reason to say that the UAC should not use Require:
199. But, we still need to say what it means IF it does so, and I think
that was what Robert was thinking about.

I don't like must-nots if it doesn't break the protocol. But, I agree we
should strongly recommend against it.

>I'm almost tempted to say we shouldn't even have an option-tag at all
(the Supported lists are getting quite big), but

Yes. And, the solution to long Supported lists is not to stop defining
option tags, at least when there are good reasons to define them.

Christer

Developers and product managers read SHOULD NOT as basically optional, and customers have a hard time forcing vendors to follow SHOULDs compared with MUSTs.  We've seen this time and time again.  The _protocol_ may not "break", but user expectations and experience "breaks", and at the end of the day that hurts all of us.  Well, it doesn't hurt me right now - it's created a market opportunity for SBCs to go and fix it; but having middleboxes fix bad implementations is not good in the long term for SIP.

IMO interoperability isn't just about _protocol_ behavior, it's the resultant user experience too.  Legitimate call attempts must succeed.  The spice must flow. ;)

The issue here is if they hit some other proprietary usage of the same
string in an option-tag. If it is an entirely closed space they should
get away with it, but in this case they can just declare the support to
be mandatory in both entities anyway.

In any case, where any info-packages are being deployed out into general
UE space, I hope that the vast majority of these info-packages do not
need the dialog to fail if the package is not supported. In which case
we are talking about option tag needs being very much a corner case.

regards

Keith

But now you are making the assumption that all info-packages require the
call to fail if I do not support the info package. 

By default, we must make the ordinary assumption we make for all
extensions, i.e. that we can discard the information if it is not
understood.

So far the devices I've seen which do proprietary option-tags in Supported generally stick to the rfc2543 defined way of doing it with the reverse domain name concept, to avoid name collision.  This is in fact how some vendors are doing negotiation of proprietary-INFO right now. (you can google to see this)

And yes I agree with you that using a package type that needs the dialog to fail if the other side doesn't do it is really a bad idea or a corner case.  I believe MSCML would have been an example of one that would have made sense for it, maybe.  Camera control could be another one.

RFC 2119 section 6 says:

6. Guidance in the use of these Imperatives

   Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care
   and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is
   actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has
   potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For
   example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
   on implementors where the method is not required for
   interoperability.

I'm not at all sure we can justify MUST NOT here. It's not required for
interop, does not cause harm to the network, and there are presumably
legit use cases (such as diagnostics) for using it in a Require.

No, I'm not. I'm saying that SOME non-standards-track INFO packages will
need the call to fail if the far end does not support INFO packages. If
they don't need it to fail, they shouldn't use the options tag in a
Require directive.

This is pretty basic stuff, kids. Why are you making it so darned hard?

Don't even get me started on explaining the blatant hypocrisy in that
statement when compared to the extensions driven from 3GPP ;-).

And that in a nutshell is why middleboxes end up doing interop fixing stuff.


> It's not required for
> interop, does not cause harm to the network,

There are thousands of deployed SIP networks.  Not one of them currently supports this 199 mechanism, AFAIK.  Putting it in a Require will not interoperate with any of them, and has a potential for causing harm to the service SIP is supposed to provide: session establishment.  Obviously this interoperates in the sense that the far-end will fail it, and we have to be able to add option tags in Require for some new things; but this 199 mechanism isn't in the same vein as privacy or replaces option tags which need to be put in Require sometimes to make calls work.  Honestly we should have been more careful in the past about this, so we might as well start now.

You may think this is a no-brainer, and that no one would be so dumb as to put it in a Require, but history has already proven otherwise for other option tags.  Been there, done that, have the T-shirt.  It works in the closed environment they deploy in at first, and then breaks when the environment grows or is no longer closed.  I can already envision what will happen with 199: some other SDO will decide this 199 thing is a good idea and makes the user experience better, so it should be required in release X of their specs.

Then say MUST NOT except for diagnostic purposes.

Again, if a non-standards-track INFO package needs its info package, they'll do non-standard things to get the behavior they need, by putting their non-standard package name in Require, and it works.  It is not necessary for us to help them.  And again doing a check for the generic info-package draft support is not sufficient to accomplish their goal anyway, because as soon as another device supports the draft but not their specific non-standard one, they're back to square one.  So it's neither necessary nor sufficient.  What is there to debate over?

Because it's easier (and cheaper) to debate this now than to handle the tech-support calls later.

But that's why we're in the IETF and not 3GPP.

Hi,

Comments on the minor feedback from Robert.
 
-----

I am not sure I disagree with you, but I am trying to figure out what
optimization really means in this context.

As far as the limitation is concerned, I guess that is because of the
fact that it is an optional feature, and that it cannot be assumed that
199 responses will be received for all terminated dialogs.


-----

I think that wording has been used elsewhere, but I can use something
else.


-----

>The most likely interpretation of the given text is just the UAC.

Now, assuming that both forking proxies and UASs can send 199, how about
the following:

"This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog
Terminated, which 
a SIP forking proxy and UAS can use to indicate upstream towards the UAC
that an
early dialog has been terminated, before a final response is sent
towards the UAC."


-----


>min-4) The last sentence of the 5th paragraph of the 
>Introduction (which starts "When SIP entities upstream 
>receive") says SIP entities but talk about things that only 
>UACs can do, specifically terminating the session startup.

When SIP entities upstream receive the non-2xx final response they will
automatically terminate the session setup
and all associated early dialogs.

I could replace the text with the following:

"When SIP entities upstream receive the non-2xx final response they will
release resources associated with the session, and the UAC will terminte
the session setup."


-----


>min-5) Paragraph 1 of section 4 (Client Behavior) can be read 
>to say a UAC MUST always insert a Supported:199. It should 
>start with a conditional clause such as "If the client wants 
>to receive 199 responses, then".

Correct. I'll fix that.


-----


>min-6) Item 5 in section 4.1 talks about dialogs being "inactive"  
>which doesn't have meaning - I think it meant to say "the 
>sessions associated with some early dialogs may be set to inactive".

I could replace the text with the following:

"5. Limited access resources - in case of forking and multiple stream it
may not be possible to allow early 
media on all dialogs, so media sessions associated with some dialogs may
e.g. be set to "inactive". When a 
dialog is terminated, media sessions associated with other dialogs can
be allowed."



-----
 
>min-7) Section 5 should be titled "User-Agent Server" 
>behavior to avoid confusion with Proxies.

Ok.


-----

Ok.

How about replacing:

"When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response which
terminates an early dialog and the proxy does not intend to forward
the final response immediately (due to the rules for a forking
proxy), and the UAC has indicated support of the 199 response code,
the proxy MUST generate and send a 199 provisional response upstream
for that early dialog, unless the proxy prior has received and
forwarded a 199 response for that early dialog.  The 199 provisional
response MUST contain a To header tag parameter, which identifies the
early dialog that has been terminated."

...with:

"When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response which terminates
one or more (if forking has occured early dialogs, and the proxy does
not intend to forward the 
final response immedialetly (due to the rules for a forking proxy), and 
the UAC has indicated support of the 199 response code, the proxy must 
generate and send a 199 provisional response upstream for the early
dialog 
on which the non-2xx final response was received. If the forking proxy
is able 
to identify additional early dialogs which are terminated by the same
non-2xx 
final response, the proxy must also generate and send a 199 provional
response upstream for each of those early dialogs."

...and by removing the NOTE.

I think that would make the text more clear.

Hi Hadriel,

I don't disagree with you.

However, there are examples where we do this kind of restrictions (e.g.
you-must-not-use-header-x-in-message-y) when we write our specs, and
later use-cases come up where those restrictions cause problems. 

Backward compability is important, but forward compability is also
important :)

As far as other SDOs are concerned, at least 3GPP doesn't specify that a
UA inserts 199 in Require.

Regards,

Christer

"MUST NOT unless you have a reason" is the definition of "SHOULD NOT".

The product managers of the world may be illiterate, but changing SIP's
definitions of requirements language relative to the rest of IETF is not
likely to help them in the long term.

I see things differently -- the reason we have trouble with our specs is
we've required everything useful to go through standardization with a
very high level of review required. Hence, people have done the simple
things and just implemented non-standard solutions without the safety
mechanisms of standard solutions. Personally, I'd like to see options
tags available for informational documents, experimental documents,
thrid-party specifications, and even first-come, first-served
vendor-tree extensions. But that is NOT the process we have.

In you own words in other messages on this thread you explain how the
vendors will happily do non-standard stuff if they need to get get
things done, like invent their own option tag for an unregistered info
package. Why should we force them to do that?

Hi,

One thing on min-2:

"Upstream" and "Downstream" are actually defined terms in RFC3261, and
also used in the text.

In effect the proxy is sending the response in lieu of the final 
response it is not ready to forward. IMO it ought to include whatever 
Contact and R-R is present in that final response. There isn't any need 
to *store* that information, since the final response is at hand when 
the 199 is being generated.

Hi,

True.

But, if the error response also terminates other early dialogs (in case
forking also occured downstream), and if the forking proxy is able to
identify those early dialogs, the forking proxy generates 199s also for
those dialogs. The proxy would need to store the C/R-R information in
order to be able to insert it in the 199s for those early dialogs.

However, I don't think that "multiple forking" will occur very often.

Christer

Sure we make mistakes just like anyone, though with regard to MUST NOT's we follow them more often than I think we ought to, ironically.
But no I was not referring to us - I was referring to the (rather common) situation where a device does not follow a SHOULD NOT, and because it was a SHOULD instead of MUST strength they get away with claiming it was not required to be followed.

Maybe it's just me who sees this happening?  That's certainly possible and if so I'll shut up about it.

The problem with this is that the non-2xx final response will not necessarily have Record-Route or Contact headers since 3261 does not require it. In fact, a strict reading of Table 2 & 3 forbids them in most error responses. If the proxy is going to generate a 199 response, it should include the same Record-Route & Contact as the original early dialog creating 1xx response.

There are all sorts of reasons we have trouble with our specs, but one of them is not the amount of review required, but that we add in "features" or corner-cases into mechanisms that make them more complicated than the problem actually being addressed needs it to be.  Because that makes the spec more complicated, the review takes longer and thus it takes a lot longer to stop changing and reach RFC status; and the spec being more complicated and taking longer means vendors just do their own thing or don't implement them as expected.

Info-packages is a classic example of this.  We have little hope of vendors implementing it if it ends up being complicated, because there is already an INFO mechanism today that works for their needs.

Why is that, BTW?  What was the rationale for changing option-tag use between 2543 and 3261?

That is a different question than "should we have an info-package draft option tag".  I'm fine with providing a way for non-standard uses of Foo to identify their non-standard Foo in Supported.  But I guess that requires an update to 3261?

ISTM that the kinds of failures that will result from inappropriate use 
of Require:199 are self limiting. They will break things early in 
interop testing, and be fixed.

Omitting the option tag altogether wouldn't be so bad either. All UAs 
must be prepared to handle unknown error codes. If not understood, the 
199 will be treated as a 100. (Hmm, considering the special treatment of 
100, that isn't wonderful, but it does no harm.)

IMO the only reason to have the option tag is as an optimization, to 
prevent the sending of the extra message unless somebody cares about it. 
If it is only sent in the forking cases, this optimization may not be 
worth the trouble.

Bottom line, I propose we either:
1) have the option tag, and allow both Supported and Require, but
    include words discouraging Require; or
2) drop the option tag entirely.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Putting it in a Require will not interoperate with any of them, and has a potential for causing harm to the service SIP is supposed to provide: session establishment.  Obviously this interoperates in the sense that the far-end will fail it, and we have to be able to add option tags in Require for some new things; but this 199 mechanism isn't in the same vein as privacy or replaces option tags which need to be put in Require sometimes to make calls work.  Honestly we should have been more careful in the past about this, so we might as well start now.

Been there, done that, have the T-shirt.  It works in the closed environment they deploy in at first, and then breaks when the environment grows or is no longer closed.  I can already envision what will happen with 199: some other SDO will decide this 199 thing is a good idea and makes the user experience better, so it should be required in release X of their specs.

What would be better? Phrases like "toward the UAC" amd "toward the UAS" 
would *work* but are cumbersome.

Would it help to define upstream and downstream in the document?

You are refreshingly optimistic. :)  Have you read 3GPP specs recently?  In theory their behavior should be self-limiting too; but it works in their closed single-vendor environments on day-1, then breaks on day-2 when the environment grows or another vendor is added.  And since the new vendor being added is the one with motivation to make things work, the new vendor is the one that will add 199 support.  Then one day the customer will want to connect their network to others, and boom.

If we can't think of any legitimate use for an option-tag in Require, why should we allow it?

Normally when we define new response codes, don't we just let IANA 
assign the next one when the document is finalized? Is this one really 
so special that it *needs* the last provisional code? Any reason this 
shouldn't be 18x? (x=4 unless thats been taken by something in the pipe. 
183 is the last one IANA shows.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

The thing that makes me most uncomfortable with an option tag for info-packages is that it is expanding the scope of an option tag from a single well-defined extension/feature to a whole class of features that are not necessarily related. I see it as being analogous to defining an option tag for event-packages that could be used to fail calls because the UAS does not support SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY. The other thing that is bothersome is that one day, the calls are failing for your mystery application, the next day they succeed because the UAS was upgraded to support SOME info-package, but not your mystery feature and you will have to terminate successful calls because of it.

I think we should change the section about OPTIONS to require the UAS to include its supported info-packages in the response if the request had a Recv-Info header. That way you could probe the far end if you really require your info-package to be there.

cheers,

I see things differently -- the reason we have trouble with our specs is
we've required everything useful to go through standardization with a
very high level of review required. Hence, people have done the simple
things and just implemented non-standard solutions without the safety
mechanisms of standard solutions. Personally, I'd like to see options
tags available for informational documents, experimental documents,
thrid-party specifications, and even first-come, first-served
vendor-tree extensions. But that is NOT the process we have.

In you own words in other messages on this thread you explain how the
vendors will happily do non-standard stuff if they need to get get
things done, like invent their own option tag for an unregistered info
package. Why should we force them to do that?

In fact, a strict reading of Table 2 & 3 forbids them in most error responses. If the proxy is going to generate a 199 response, it should include the same Record-Route & Contact as the original early dialog creating 1xx response.

Good point.

Unfortunately, that significantly raises the bar for the proxy to 
implement this. It needs to store a lot more state than it otherwise 
would need. Not a problem for a B2BUA of course, since it already has to 
store that.

This then leaves us in a situation where a proxy incurs this significant 
extra cost to support 199, unless we make the inclusion of the R-R and 
Contact optional in the 199. I guess the Contact is already optional 
(though we have had discussions about that), but isn't the R-R required 
in all the provisional responses?

	Thanks,

There was some well-founded concern that other SIP-using SDOs would  
use flexible extensibility specification to essentially rewrite SIP  
into a more-tentacled leviathan than it currently is, and that making  
extensions STD-RFC-required would force them back to the IETF for  
sanity review. There is widespread opinion that the specification  
divergence was reduced by this.

Of course, there is also widespread opinion that we should surrender  
SIP to the telephone world, wash our hands, and go back to solving  
Internet problems, so you have to pick your opinions carefully.

Update to RFC 3427, actually, since that updates the specification  
strengths of 3261.

According to the tables in chapter 20 of 3261, Contact is optional in
1xx responses, and R-R is optional in 18x responses (the table doesn't
cover R-R for 199 :).

In addition, according to chapter 12.1.1 R-R is only mandatory in
responses which creates a dialog (which the 199 doesn't).

"When a UAS responds to a request with a response that establishes a
dialog (such as a 2xx to INVITE), the UAS MUST copy all Record-Route
header field values from the request into the response (including the
URIs, URI parameters, and any Record-Route header field parameters,
whether they are known or unknown to the UAS) and MUST maintain the
order of those values."

Having said that, I don't think it would have a significant impact even
if the forking proxy would have to store this information.

Christer

Hi, 

>Normally when we define new response codes, don't we just let IANA
assign the next one when the document is finalized? Is this one really
so special that it *needs* the last provisional code? Any reason
>this shouldn't be 18x? (x=4 unless thats been taken by something in the
pipe. 183 is the last one IANA shows.)

Due to the nature of the response code, I think it IS special. So,
therefor I think we should go for 199 (or, maybe 101, if that for some
reason is better).

Christer

In theory their behavior should be self-limiting too; but it works in

And since the new vendor being added is the one with motivation to make

Because there may be a legitimate use for it tomorrow, or next week, or

Hi,

If we can't even use the words defined, and used, in 3261 (and probably
in other specs) something is really wrong, and to start using different
wordings in different documents isn't going to make things more clear in
my opinion... 

However, I have no problem to copy/paste the definition text from 3261
into the 199-draft, if that helps.

Regards,

Christer

What would be better? Phrases like "toward the UAC" amd "toward the UAS"

would *work* but are cumbersome.

Would it help to define upstream and downstream in the document?

Hi,

Yes. That is the reason we decided to add the option-tag.

worth the trouble.

I see no trouble. We would just need to agree on some wording.

>Bottom line, I propose we either:

include words discouraging Require; or

I will give my hum for 1).

currently supports this 199 mechanism, AFAIK.  Putting it in a Require
will not interoperate with any of them, and has a potential for causing
harm to the service SIP is supposed to provide: session establishment.
Obviously this interoperates in the sense that the far-end will fail it,
and we have to be able to add option tags in Require for some new
things; but this 199 mechanism isn't in the same vein as privacy or
replaces option tags which need to be put in Require sometimes to make
calls work.  Honestly we should have been more careful in the past about
this, so we might as well start now.
> 
> You may think this is a no-brainer, and that no one would be so dumb
as to put it in a Require, but history has already proven otherwise for
other option tags.  Been there, done that, have the T-shirt.  It works
in the closed environment they deploy in at first, and then breaks when
the environment grows or is no longer closed.  I can already envision
what will happen with 199: some other SDO will decide this 199 thing is
a good idea and makes the user experience better, so it should be
required in release X of their specs.

I'm going to abstain from this particular issue from now on.
I don't see any good use for this option, but its not worth arguing more 
about.

	Thanks,

Hi Hadriel,

mistakes made by their existing SBCs..... ;)

I've seen lots of funny stuff during the years also.

But, I think the correct way to prevent those is to make sure our specs
are clear enough, and easy to understand - not to start making
restrictions which may shoot back later.

Regards,

Christer

Well people do upgrade.  I think they usually find it easier to upgrade their SBCs than upgrade their customers' PBX's or peer's equipment, or even their own core servers.

The thing is with the 199-type of mechanism I actually don't think we should ever allow such a thing to be Required, ever.

What you are basically asking for is to create a new 1xx response code some device may require in order to operate correctly, and that I think is a bad idea.

Changing RFC 3261 is entirely possible. You write a draft that updates
it.

But we need to think through why that was made that way in the first
place.

I think you yourself have admitted that option-tags in Require headers
are overused (and abused). Therefore I believe if we relax the IANA
registration requirement for registering new ones, we also need to
address how we stop people putting them in Require headers when they do
not need to.

Which is why I carefully put the word "Supported" in my statement: "to identify their non-standard Foo in Supported".  :)

It occurs to me maybe we're talking past each other.  When I think of the *Require* header, I think of what does any random endpoint/gateway getting this request have to support for this to succeed.  I can see no value in having that behavior, and plenty of harm in doing so.  I don't want a UAC maker to ever think it can require UAS' to implement 199 in order for its request to succeed.
But maybe what you're talking about is *Proxy-Require*?

It's difficult to tell whether RFC 3427 updates RFC 3261 in this
respect. It certainly does not change the IANA requirements, but it is
unclear whether it is restating the existing requirements, or just
mentioning them in an aside for completeness.

Either way, it is currently required to be standards track RFC, but you
can change it with another standards track RFC if you so wish to start
the process for one.

When I think of the *Require* header, I think of what does any random endpoint/gateway getting this request have to support for this to succeed.  I can see no value in having that behavior, and plenty of harm in doing so.  I don't want a UAC maker to ever think it can require UAS' to implement 199 in order for its request to succeed.
> But maybe what you're talking about is *Proxy-Require*?

Well, we know tht Proxy-Require is way more evil.

Even so, it probably is the thing that a UAC might want to use if it 
knew there were proxies doing the forking.

Trouble is - B2BUAs cause a lot of trouble with Require/Proxy-Require. I 
suspect that Proxy-Require should have been MiddleBox-Require, and so 
applied to B2BUAs.

So if you really need 199 responses any time a forked invite might have 
been abandoned, then I think you must use *both* Require and 
Proxy-Require. But that is pretty certain to guarantee that your call 
will fail.

This has convinced me that there is no valid use of Require / Proxy-Require.

	Thanks,
	Paul

We have one; SUBSCRIBE. If it doesn't show in the Supported methods,  
don't send a SUBSCRIBE.

Unfortunately, INFO method support is not enough, as there are  
prepackage INFO implementations in the wild. So we have three cases to  
differentiate: No INFO, Old INFO, and new INFO packages.

But now you can look at the info package negotiation and figure out  
that it does not support the mystery-package, and tell what other  
packages it does support (and write the application to adapt to the  
available packages).

While that makes perfect sense, it is inconsistent with the use of  
OPTIONS tags in RFC 3261. I'd like to change that part of 3261  
someday . . .

Okay, that's an interesting argument.

In essence, you are saying that Requiring 199 support might break  
interoperability, therefore it should be forbidden.

Yet we have test scenarios where requiring 199 might be reasonable in  
order to differentiate the set of results expected in a test scenario.  
Such a scenario doesn't break anything.

This is hard to reconcile.

Wow! It really hurts when I strike my back with these knotted cords.  
But when I do it long enough, I get these nifty visions of a perfect  
architecture . . .

Maybe I should stop? Maybe I should invite my friends to do it too?

In other words, pain is the only educational tool we have. When it  
hurts, they'll either stop doing it, or make a religious cult out of  
the experience and encourage other people to play along.

Either way, the physics are the same.

For each options tag, the RFC defining it should discuss when it is  
used in requests by the UAC.

It might be reasonable to give guidance about NOT using one; that is  
not using it in a Require. But the level of guidance, I think, is a  
SHOULD NOT. This needs to be explained: What happens if you do it  
anyhow? the answer is not "the network breaks", but "any UAS not  
supporting this feature will reject the request. Since this feature is  
only an optimization over previous behavior, rejecting a request over  
this lack is very likely to be undesirable behavior. Don't be stupid."

(As SIP WG chair)

As announced in the SIP WG.

Submitted Wed, Nov 19th 2008 (during Plenary), so there's no excuse for
not having read it yet
Modified text per discussions surrounding 
		draft-ietf-geopriv-sip-lo-retransmission-01
Added indication (header parameter) for whether or not location can be
viewed or dereferenced for routing in transit even if UAC did not insert
it
		Geolocation: routing-allowed=(yes or no)
Added paragraph for B2BUA and SBC implementers to act like proxies when
either receives SIP request containing location and is not the ultimate
destination UAS (edited out the "pretty please with sugar on top" text
though)
So, when does the (next) WGLC start?
			(I can't wait till this gets to the IESG... Oh,
the fun then!)

So in summary, please look at this, in particular the coding of the
routeing-allowed, and tell us whether this matches your aspirations from
draft-ietf-geopriv-sip-lo-retransmission-01 (preferably by the end of
the week). If you are happy, we will WGLC it.

regards

Keith

To me this has only convinced me that R/P-R in general is bad, and
should be avoided. But, that we have known all the time, and nobody has
argued against it.

Based on the use-cases etc we have today, I think we all agree that one
really shouldn't require 199, so I don't think we need to argue about
that.

And, if the group wants to forbid Require:199 we will of course do that.
My personal prefernce, however, would still be to add text which
strongly discourages the use of Require.

Regards,

Christer

It doesn't matter what extension you require - if the other end doesn't
support it you will "break interoperability".

The point is that some extensions may really be needed in order to
things to work, so it makes more sense to require those. 

199 for sure is NOT an extensions which it makes sense to require.

Christer

Hi,

I think it would also have been very useful to have a
Forking-Proxy-Require header.

Hi Tim,
=20
So, I guess the use-case you are thinking about is when an AS
establishes an early dialog with the UAC, in order to play some early
media stream, and then sends 199 afterwards to terminate that dialog?
=20
I think that would fit with the proposed UAS rule, saying that a UAS
which establishes more than one dialog would be allowed to send 199.
=20
Or, did I missunderstand your use-case? :)
=20
Regards,
=20
Christer

	Christer,

	Sorry, when I said "mis-interpret what they see as forking" I
meant to refer to serial forking, which is of course a form of forking.
So there's no mis-interpretation (except mine!). =20
	=20
	But anyway the thought was that by providing a way to explicitly
release an early media stream the 199 could enable a "middle box" (SBC)
that today blocks serial forking, to support it.  This is one of the use
cases Hadriel mentioned.

			Subject: [Sip] 199 Open Issue: UAS sending 199
		=09

			Hi,=20

			The main open issue in the 199 draft at the
moment is when a UAS sends 199 - IF a UAS sends 199.=20

			The alternative proposals I have at the moment
are described below (can also be found in the slides I was supposed to
present yesterday).


			1.      UAS never sends 199:=20

			In this case only forking proxies/B2BUA would
send 199.=20



			2.      UAS always sends 199:=20

			The issue with this alternative is that 199
would be sent even if no forking has occurred - which can be assumed to
be the case in a large percentage of all calls.

		=09

			3.      UAS sends 199 if forking proxy does not
support 199:=20

			With this alternative the forking proxy would
have to insert an indicator that it supports 199.=20

			Also, the UAS may not know whether it is the
forking proxy closest to the UAS that has inserted the indicator. This
may not be a big issues, since I assume in most forking cases there will
only be one forking proxy in the signalling path.




			4.      UAS sends 199 once procedures have
reached a certain state=20

			With this alternative 199 would not be sent
until certain actions have taken place on an early dialog=20

			Example: preconditions have been indicated as
met=20
			Example: SDP answer has been sent=20

			The issue is that one would always have to
specify at what point of different procedures 199 would be sengt.=20



			5.      UAC and UAS negotiate sending of 199
once the early dialog has been established:=20

			With this alternative that UAC would tell the
UAS that forking has occurred (could this be useful information also for
non-199 procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be sent.

			The issues with this alternative is that it may
require additional signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't be sent for
other reasons) to inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

			Other alternatives?=20

			NOTE: Robert S also raised an issue on what
Require: 199 means. But, I think that outcome of that issue may depend
on what way forward we choose for the issue in this mail.

			Regards,=20

			Christer=20

Christer,
=20
Yes, that's what I meant.  Maybe this is a usage more common in IMS, but
(as you know) in IMS it is possible for an S-CSCF to invoke application
servers on behalf of the party (calling or called) it is serving.  The
AS's may in turn establish early media dialogs.  It would be useful in
terms of being economical with resources (particularly in the RAN) to
release the associated resources as soon as possible.  Sometimes it's
more than "useful", sometimes it's necessary, because of limitations
e.g., in a "middlebox" (SBC or IMS equivalent thereof).  Today we
redesign call flows to avoid such issues, but it would be nice not to
have to.
=20
I'm not sure this fits the proposed UAS rule.  My concern isn't with a
single UAS that establishes multiple dialogs, it's with a series of
UAS's each of which will generally only establish one dialog (and each
of which is generally unaware of the others).
=20
If I made S-CSCF's I'd probably feel that the AS's should "clean up
their own mess" (issue a 199 prior to releasing control back to the
S-CSCF); even if the AS had only established one dialog.  I suppose it's
also possible for the S-CSCF to clean up after the AS, and arguably the
S-CSCF is in a better position to know whether a 199 is necessary.  But
it seems complicated to ask this of the S-CSCF since it would have to
monitor the SDP of all messages to and from AS's it invokes, to know
which ones established early media dialogs and failed to "close them
out".
=20
Is it problematic to allow a UAS to issue a 199 even if it has
established only a single dialog?

	Hi Tim,
	=20
	So, I guess the use-case you are thinking about is when an AS
establishes an early dialog with the UAC, in order to play some early
media stream, and then sends 199 afterwards to terminate that dialog?
	=20
	I think that would fit with the proposed UAS rule, saying that a
UAS which establishes more than one dialog would be allowed to send 199.
	=20
	Or, did I missunderstand your use-case? :)
	=20
	Regards,

		Christer,
		=20
		Sorry, when I said "mis-interpret what they see as
forking" I meant to refer to serial forking, which is of course a form
of forking.  So there's no mis-interpretation (except mine!). =20
		=20
		But anyway the thought was that by providing a way to
explicitly release an early media stream the 199 could enable a "middle
box" (SBC) that today blocks serial forking, to support it.  This is one
of the use cases Hadriel mentioned.

				Subject: [Sip] 199 Open Issue: UAS
sending 199
			=09
			=09


				Hi,=20

				The main open issue in the 199 draft at
the moment is when a UAS sends 199 - IF a UAS sends 199.=20

				The alternative proposals I have at the
moment are described below (can also be found in the slides I was
supposed to present yesterday).


				1.      UAS never sends 199:=20

				In this case only forking proxies/B2BUA
would send 199.=20



				2.      UAS always sends 199:=20

				The issue with this alternative is that
199 would be sent even if no forking has occurred - which can be assumed
to be the case in a large percentage of all calls.

			=09

				3.      UAS sends 199 if forking proxy
does not support 199:=20

				With this alternative the forking proxy
would have to insert an indicator that it supports 199.=20

				Also, the UAS may not know whether it is
the forking proxy closest to the UAS that has inserted the indicator.
This may not be a big issues, since I assume in most forking cases there
will only be one forking proxy in the signalling path.




				4.      UAS sends 199 once procedures
have reached a certain state=20

				With this alternative 199 would not be
sent until certain actions have taken place on an early dialog=20

				Example: preconditions have been
indicated as met=20
				Example: SDP answer has been sent=20

				The issue is that one would always have
to specify at what point of different procedures 199 would be sengt.=20



				5.      UAC and UAS negotiate sending of
199 once the early dialog has been established:=20

				With this alternative that UAC would
tell the UAS that forking has occurred (could this be useful information
also for non-199 procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be sent.

				The issues with this alternative is that
it may require additional signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't be sent
for other reasons) to inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

				Other alternatives?=20

				NOTE: Robert S also raised an issue on
what Require: 199 means. But, I think that outcome of that issue may
depend on what way forward we choose for the issue in this mail.

				Regards,=20

				Christer=20

Hi Tim, 
	 
>Yes, that's what I meant.  Maybe this is a usage more common in IMS,
but (as you know) in IMS it is possible for an S-CSCF to invoke
application servers on behalf of the party (calling or 
>called) it is serving.  The AS's may in turn establish early media
dialogs.  It would be useful in terms of being economical with resources
(particularly in the RAN) to release the associated

sometimes it's necessary, because of limitations e.g., in a "middlebox"
(SBC or IMS equivalent thereof).  Today we redesign 
>call flows to avoid such issues, but it would be nice not to have to.

Yes. And, I don't think it is IMS specific having an application servers
which creates a specific dialog for anouncmements etc :)
	 
>I'm not sure this fits the proposed UAS rule.  My concern isn't with a
single UAS that establishes multiple dialogs, it's with a series of
UAS's each of which will generally only establish one 
>dialog (and each of which is generally unaware of the others).
>	 
>If I made S-CSCF's I'd probably feel that the AS's should "clean up
their own mess" (issue a 199 prior to releasing control back to the
S-CSCF); even if the AS had only established one dialog.  
>I suppose it's also possible for the S-CSCF to clean up after the AS,
and arguably the S-CSCF is in a better position to know whether a 199 is
necessary.  But it seems complicated to ask this

dialogs and failed to "close them out".

established only a single dialog?

Well, I could add some text, saying that an UAS may do it "based on
configuration", or something like that. I think the important thing is
that UASs don't start to send 199 responses "by default".

Regards,

Christer

		Hi Tim,
		 
		So, I guess the use-case you are thinking about is when
an AS establishes an early dialog with the UAC, in order to play some
early media stream, and then sends 199 afterwards to terminate that
dialog?
		 
		I think that would fit with the proposed UAS rule,
saying that a UAS which establishes more than one dialog would be
allowed to send 199.
		 
		Or, did I missunderstand your use-case? :)
		 
		Regards,
		 
		Christer

			Christer,
			 
			Sorry, when I said "mis-interpret what they see
as forking" I meant to refer to serial forking, which is of course a
form of forking.  So there's no mis-interpretation (except mine!).  
			 
			But anyway the thought was that by providing a
way to explicitly release an early media stream the 199 could enable a
"middle box" (SBC) that today blocks serial forking, to support it.
This is one of the use cases Hadriel mentioned.

					Subject: [Sip] 199 Open Issue:
UAS sending 199
					
					


					Hi, 

					The main open issue in the 199
draft at the moment is when a UAS sends 199 - IF a UAS sends 199. 

					The alternative proposals I have
at the moment are described below (can also be found in the slides I was
supposed to present yesterday).


					1.      UAS never sends 199: 

					In this case only forking
proxies/B2BUA would send 199. 



					2.      UAS always sends 199: 

					The issue with this alternative
is that 199 would be sent even if no forking has occurred - which can be
assumed to be the case in a large percentage of all calls.

	
3.      UAS sends 199 if forking proxy does not support 199: 

					With this alternative the
forking proxy would have to insert an indicator that it supports 199. 

					Also, the UAS may not know
whether it is the forking proxy closest to the UAS that has inserted the
indicator. This may not be a big issues, since I assume in most forking
cases there will only be one forking proxy in the signalling path.




					4.      UAS sends 199 once
procedures have reached a certain state 

					With this alternative 199 would
not be sent until certain actions have taken place on an early dialog 

					Example: preconditions have been
indicated as met 
					Example: SDP answer has been
sent 

					The issue is that one would
always have to specify at what point of different procedures 199 would
be sengt. 



					5.      UAC and UAS negotiate
sending of 199 once the early dialog has been established: 

					With this alternative that UAC
would tell the UAS that forking has occurred (could this be useful
information also for non-199 procedures?), and that it wants 199 to be
sent.

					The issues with this alternative
is that it may require additional signalling (unless PRACK/UPDATE won't
be sent for other reasons) to inform the UAS that forking has occurred.

					Other alternatives? 

					NOTE: Robert S also raised an
issue on what Require: 199 means. But, I think that outcome of that
issue may depend on what way forward we choose for the issue in this
mail.

					Regards, 

					Christer

Hello.

I need to understand the source of my problem with SIP trunk and
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 (Unified Messaging feature). I have a
PBX Aastra/Ericsson MX-ONE that receive an SIP response 415 -
Unsupported Media Type from Exchange UM Server.

Here the conversation packets when I try to call de Exchange UM from
an analog extension:

PBX > Exchange | INVITE
sip:user@exchangeserver,user=phone,transport=tcp; (default port 5060)
Exchange > PBX | 100 Trying;
Exchange > PBX | 302 Moved temporarily; (because Exchange UM works
with two processes)
PBX > Exchange | ACK sip:user@exchangeserver,user=phone,transport=tcp;
PBX > Exchange | INVITE
sip:user@exchangeserver:5065,user=phone,transport=tcp; (the port 5065
is for UMWorkerProcess.exe, on UM Server).
Exchange > PBX | 100 Trying;
Exchange > PBX | 180 Ringing;
Exchange > PBX | 200 OK;
PBX > Exchange | ACK
sip:<UM_Server_FQDN>:5065,transport=tcp,maddr=<UM_Server_IP_address>;
PBX > Exchange | INVITE
sip:<UM_Server_FQDN>:5065,transport=tcp,maddr=<UM_Server_IP_address>;
Exchange > PBX | 100 Trying;
Exchange > PBX | 415 Unsupported Media Type;
PBX > Exchange | ACK
sip:<UM_Server_FQDN>:5065,transport=tcp,maddr=<UM_Server_IP_address>;
PBX > Exchange | BYE
sip:<UM_Server_FQDN>:5065,transport=tcp,maddr=<UM_Server_IP_address>;

Can anynone help me?

Best regards.

I think that this is a simple and obvious extension of the existing HTTP
digest mechanism.  SIP made the choice to change proxy authentication
from the hop-by-hop architecture from HTTP to the end-to-middle model in
SIP, but did not adopt the ability of the end to verify that the proxy
actually can verify the credentials. 

It seems entirely reasonable to me to rectify this now.

Scott,

I had additional offline discussions with Ekr and Cullen last week. Ekr
indicated that the proposed I-D does not align with the SIP security
model (UE <=> next-hop authentication; no need for UE <=>
<authentication beyond next hop>). 

This led to the question as to why we allow for the use of the
Authentication-Info header. The response I received was that this may
have been an oversight. If this is the case, I indicated that we may
want to clarify (or correct) this. 

Ekr, Cullen,

Feel free to add (or correct) my understanding.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Essential correction for IPv6 ABNF and URI comparison in RFC3261
	Author(s)       : V. Gurbani, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-03.txt
	Pages           : 9
	Date            : 2008-11-25

This memo corrects the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) production
rule associated with generating IPv6 literals in RFC3261.  It also
clarifies the rule for Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) comparison
when the URIs contain textual representation of IP addresses.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix-03.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP at:

All: In IETF 73 we conducted an experiment across a few working
groups (alto, sip, sipping) to allow us to better track the
face-to-face discussions.

In that vein, we have created a one-stop shop for all SIP WG
media and discussion that happened at the IETF 73.  At the URL
below, you will find each IETF 73 SIP WG agenda item complete
with a:

     1. Link to the specific audio recording for that agenda item.
     2. Link to the slides presented during WG for that agenda item.
     3. Link to the minutes captured for that agenda item (this
        link is now empty until the chairs digest the minutes.)

We hope this helps draft editors track the specific consensus
reached and follow the mic discussions in a more organized manner.
This layout also helps those participants who are simply interested
in a subset of the WG agenda item discussion.

The one-stop shop URL to access SIP WG media and discussions
during IETF 73 is:

http://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/SIP_Audio_for_IETF_73

Please let me know if this is helpful to track the work, or if you
have any questions or comments.

Thanks much.

Huh?

We have long held that there may be multiple proxies (possibly in  
different domains) challenging a given request. This has been a  
hallmark of scenarios such as the "hotel proxy" that doesn't do  
authentication or act as a an identity server but that does do local  
firewall control.

So somebody is confused about something. Who knows, might be me,  
occasionally I wake up in a different time-space continuum, but AFAIK,  
we've always intended to support authentication more than one hop  
away. In fact, I recall design discussions with Pingtel and 3Com  
people about that as far back as 1999. Robert Sparks had a lot to say  
about it, IIRC.

        URL:        http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5373.txt

This document extends SIP with two header fields and associated
option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the
requester's preference for user-interface handling related to
answering of that request.  The first header, "Answer-Mode",
expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface
waits for user input before accepting the request or, instead,
accepts the request without waiting on user input.  The second
header, "Priv-Answer-Mode", is similar to the first, except that it
requests administrative-level access and has consequent additional
authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have
applicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics
like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate
how the request was handled is also defined.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

STANDARDS TRACK: This document specifies an Internet standards track
protocol for the Internet community,and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the Internet
Official Protocol Standards (STD 1) for the standardization state and
status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Apologies that these comments are rather late:

Technical comments:

1. Why do we permit Geolocation in a PRACK request? Suppose the UAS
considers the location to be essential, but has some problem with it and
returns a 424 response. Where does this leave the reliable provisional
response that the PRACK request was supposed to be acknowledging? A
similar problem has been discussed with SDP in a PRACK request, and a
less-than-perfect solution has been found. However, for SDP we had to
find a solution because SDP has been permitted in a PRACK request since
RFC 3262. With Geolocation we have the opportunity to disallow it in a
PRACK request, thereby avoiding the problem.

2. In the example in 5.1:
";inserted-by="alice@atlanta.example.com""
I don't think alice@atlanta.example.com is a valid hostport. We could
reduce it to "atlanta.example.com", which is the same as the domain part
of the From URI, but then it would not be possible for a recipient to
distinguish whether it was inserted by the UAC or the proxy
alice@atlanta.example.com proxy. Moreover, if both the UAC and the proxy
insert a location with the same inserted-by, they would not be able to
distinguish which error code relates to the location they inserted. In
this particular case LbyV is used, so location must have been inserted
by the UAC. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to use the UAC's own host
name (i.e., from its contact URI), or if it doesn't have one, its IP
address? Of course, if the IP address is behind a NAT it might not be
unique, and I suppose there is potential for conflict if the UAC is
behind two NATs. Have there been any discussions on this? It might
require more than just fixing the example - it might require more text
on UAC behaviour to address this issue.

There are other instances in the document of inappropriate inserted-by
values.

3. "If a UAC has already conveyed location in the original request of a 
   transaction, and wants to update its location information (for 
   whatever reason) after the original request is sent, or after a 
   dialog is created (regardless of how the UAC conveyed location 
   previously, as an LbyV or LbyR) - this is done by a UAC sending an 
   UPDATE request [RFC3311]"
I think we should change "transaction" to "INVITE dialog usage".
"Transaction" is certainly wrong. The question is whether we change it
to "dialog" or "INVITE dialog usage". I think  UPDATE applies only to
INVITE dialog usages.

4. "Unless stated otherwise by future standards-track publication(s), a 
   LbyR URI only has meaning within the Geolocation header field and 
   MUST NOT appear in any other SIP header field."
This is a requirement on the UAC or proxy, yet it appears in the section
on UAS behaviour.

5. "A 
   "used-for-routing" parameter MUST NOT ever be removed from a 
   locationValue in a request."
This appears in the section on UAS behaviour, yet I don't see that it is
relevant to a UAS. The UAS is the recipient, and any passing on of
location information is outside the scope of this document. Also I don't
see how it is testable. If we need to make such a statement, I think it
should be in the proxy section.

6. "Additional locationValues inserted into a request SHOULD be placed 
   the order they were generated, and not rearranged."
Again we have a normative statement on UAC/proxy behaviour in the
section dealing with UAS behaviour.

7. "Individual header parameters in any received locationValue MUST NOT 
   be modified or deleted in transit to the ultimate destination."
Again this appears in the section on UAS behaviour, and we should not
specify the transiting of location information by a UAS to elsewhere,
since that is outside the scope of this document.

8. "A UAS MUST be prepared to receive subsequent location updates from 
   the UAC, either LbyV or LbyR (regardless of how the UAS received 
   location previously from this UAC).  The UAC will convey location 
   using the UPDATE [RFC3311] method to the UAS."
See also my earlier comment about INVITE dialog usages. I think this
paragraph too is only concerned with updates within the context of an
INVITE dialog usage.

9. "This document makes it clear that if when there are more than one 
   location, each in the same PIDF-LO MUST be about the same Target 
   (identifier) and point at the same position on the earth."
I think "MUST" should be "must", because the normative requirement is
stated elsewhere. This section is concerned only with UAS behaviour, so
cannot make normative statements applicable to the UAC or a proxy.

10. "All other entities MUST 
   ignore any locationErrorValue not directed towards them."
Again, this is in the section on UAS behaviour, so we can't make
normative requirements on other entities. Change "MUST" to "must" or
"are required to".

11. "The above example says that the Location Recipient is 
   server42.example.com, and this entity believes it cannot route this 
   message without knowing the "inserter="'s location."
server42.example.com could be a UAS - there is nothing to say it is a
proxy. Since a UAS cannot route, then change "route" to "handle", which
is more general purpose.

12. "o  there MUST NOT be more than one locationErrorValue to the same 
      "inserter=" in the request."
and then later:
"The 
   error codes destined for the same inserter MUST NOT contradict the 
   meaning of the problem the Location Recipient had with a particular 
   locationValue."
I found these two statements contradictory. The first seems to say only
one locationErrorValue per inserter, and the second seems to suggest
that you can have more than one.

13. "It is allowed, but NOT RECOMMENDED, for more than one SIP element
to
   insert location into a request along its path."
and later:
"However, if location is already in a SIP request, a SIP server 
   SHOULD NOT add another LbyR that identifies the same target in the 
   PIDF-LO (in the <tuple-id> element) to the same request."
Isn't one of these statements redundant? In fact the first statement is
broader than the second statement, so I guess the second statement is
redundant. In other words, if it is not recommended that more than one
SIP element can insert location, then it follows that a second SIP
element should not add a second location identifying the same target.

14. "However, if 
   the Geolocation header parameter "routing-allowed" is present and 
   set to "no", or is not present (knowing the default behavior is "no"
   if not present, with or without a Geolocation header), SIP servers 
   MUST NOT view the contents of the LbyV message body."
Anything that receives a request is a SIP server, including a UAS. I
think "proxies" is intended here, or perhaps B2BUAs too. This is only
one example of "SIP server" or "SIP servers" throughout the document,
all of which need checking to see whether they are really intended to
include UASs. 

15. It is not clear to me that "MUST NOT view" is a testable
requirement. "MUST NOT route on" would be more appropriate.

16. "No type of SIP server can delete a "Routing-allowed" header 
   parameter,"
Should this be a MUST NOT statement?

17. "but if one is not yet present, any SIP server MAY add a 
   "Routing-allowed" header parameter with the value set to "no" only."
This seems a rather pointless thing to do. Why can't it be set to "yes"
if there was no location there previously (and therefore upstream
entities had not already used location for routing)?

18. "If there are any errors during dereferencing, or in
   the PIDF-LO itself, the proxy will error the original request to the
   UAC with a locationErrorValue indicating what the proxy concluded 
   was wrong with the location."
What does "will error" mean here? Does it mean return a 4xx/5xx/6xx
response code, or does it mean wait for a downstream entity to return a
response code and insert a Geolocation-Error?

Nits
19. "The cid-url is defined in [RFC2392] to locate message body 
   parts.  This URI type MUST be present in a SIP request if location 
   is transmitted LbyV only."
I think "only" should be deleted.

20. In 4.3.5 on the subject of error 500:
"Action(s) to be taken by Geolocation-Error receiver to a 1XX:"
Change 1XX to 5XX.

21. In the example in 5.1:
"Contact: <sips:alice@atlanta.example.com>"
This is Alice's AOR (identical to what is in From) - it should be
different, i.e., a contact URI.

22. "understanding 
   that there are no IETF police"
Is this really an appropriate statement for an RFC? Delete.

Huh?

We have long held that there may be multiple proxies (possibly in  
different domains) challenging a given request. This has been a  
hallmark of scenarios such as the "hotel proxy" that doesn't do  
authentication or act as a an identity server but that does do local  
firewall control.

So somebody is confused about something. Who knows, might be me,  
occasionally I wake up in a different time-space continuum, but AFAIK,  
we've always intended to support authentication more than one hop  
away. In fact, I recall design discussions with Pingtel and 3Com  
people about that as far back as 1999. Robert Sparks had a lot to say  
about it, IIRC.

[S] My understanding -- based on the offline discussions -- is that the
proxy can still challenge the UA. However, the UA trusts its connection
with the next-hop and does not need to authenticate any elements beyond
the next-hop. In other words, mutual authentication is not necessary (I
used <=> to indicate mutual authentication). [[ Today, we allow for the
Authentication-Info header that allows the UA to authenticate the
registrar (even after it has established TLS with the next-hop proxy),
which also breaks this model. ]]

Thanks for the excellent review. I have comments in-line below

because I couldn't come up with a good enough reason to prohibit it 
in any Method except ACK and CANCEL.  My preference is to not allow 
it in a BYE either, but I've received more than one comment that this 
shouldn't be prevented - as there may be a use down the road that we 
cannot foresee now.

The thinking is that any 424 rejection, where Location is mandated 
(i.e., essential), overrides subsequent requests (i.e., transactions) 
within the same Call-ID until the problem about the Location (it's 
bad, it's invalid, it's not present, it can't be parsed, it can't be 
dereferenced, etc) is resolved.

Is this something you do not agree with.

Removing PRACK from being allowed to carry a Geolocation header is 
easy, I just need a good enough reason to do it.

I coped this from what's allowed in a Via header, therefore I believe 
it should be.

Exactly the problem with not identifying the exact host who inserted 
the location in the first place. This is an identifier to a 
particular host that inserted a particular location to inform the 
location recipient that determined the location was bad in order to 
target the return e2e message at a particular host in the signaling 
path that their location was considered bad and understand that host 
(and no other host) need pay attention to the error code in the 
locationErrorValue.

>Moreover, if both the UAC and the proxy

this would not happen, if this spec is followed. Each inserter= would 
be different. Pragmatically, if they are not, then each will have to 
act according to the error code.

>, they would not be able to
>distinguish which error code relates to the location they inserted.

yep, but that's their problem. Each host needs to identify themselves 
uniquely for this reason, otherwise they suffer not knowing which 
host this error is for, but will have to act as if it were both hosts.

I mentioned this is copied from the Via header, so this ought to be 
good enough. Let me know if it is not.

IP addresses will be overwritten by SBCs, pragmatically, so I'm not 
sure this is enough of an identifier, do you?

yes - this is a concern

yes

given what you and I have said above, what merger of text would you suggest?

I believe, though, that they are all consistent now. Any change will 
be global also.

I'll accept your correction, and change the text to "INVITE dialog 
usage" to be completely clear here.

yes - to guide the UAS to not pay attention to a LbyR URI anywhere 
else than a Geolocation header. The point here is to disallow usage 
of a Location URI in any header except the Geolocation header (i.e., 
not stuffed into another header).

this provides the UAS with strong guidance that a locationValue has 
been used to make a routing decision. Since more than one 
locationValue can be in a request, having this indication inside each 
locationValue that was used for routing decisions gives the UAS an 
indication - call it a history - of the path of the request towards the UAS.

 From a historical point of view, this provides an after-the-fact 
account of how each routing entity made its decision to route the 
request. This was requested specifically from the emergency calling 
folks so they can figure out if a particular routing entity made a 
bad decision - optimistically believing they can modify routing 
decisions for future/similar locations in requests.

this is specific to the answer in bullet #5, to give the UAS a path 
of entities the request passed through, in order, so the UAS can 
learn which location the request was routed to first, then which was 
second <and so on>.

but this is a *hint* at those nasty things called B2BUAs and SBCs...

I'll make the same correction to "INVITE dialog usages"

ok

I'll also correct the "...that if when there..." part of the

yeah - thanks for catching this.

This is an artifact from the old way I proposed doing the location 
error messages to the newer (and simpler) way of doing location error 
messages. The former text is true, and the latter needs to be 
modified or deleted.

yes, if any location recipient intermediary wants to view a location, 
it *must* first look to see *if* it has permission to do so, and that 
permission is in the "routing-allowed" header parameter. Is this not 
clear? Does it need to be reworded to get this meaning across?


>15. It is not clear to me that "MUST NOT view" is a testable
>requirement. "MUST NOT route on" would be more appropriate.

Geopriv wants this to mean "MUST NOT view" fully knowing their are no 
IETF police.  The aim is to prevent viewing and then the potential 
for storing and sending to a non-signaling path 3rd party would be 
prevented (if the intermediary obeyed this spec).

Perhaps this is testable by demonstrating that if 
"routing-allowed=no", that the message's location is immediately 
removed from the intermediary's cache...?


>16. "No type of SIP server can delete a "Routing-allowed" header
>    parameter,"
>Should this be a MUST NOT statement?

fair point, I'll change the text


>17. "but if one is not yet present, any SIP server MAY add a
>    "Routing-allowed" header parameter with the value set to "no" only."
>This seems a rather pointless thing to do.

the intent from the Geopriv ID is to mandate the default behavior at 
each intermediary (that follows this spec) to consider the policy 
imposed by the originator of the request to be "no" unless the flag 
is set to yes.

>Why can't it be set to "yes"
>if there was no location there previously (and therefore upstream
>entities had not already used location for routing)?

This indication is meant to dissuade any location inserted by any 
intermediary (meaning the UAC did not insert location in the first 
place) from using its own policy to inform downstream entities of the 
UAC's location. In other words, this text is meant to allow a UAC to 
tell everyone downstream that "I don't want my location used for 
routing, even if I did not include my location in this request - but 
someone else did".

Does this make sense?

Does the text need to be changed to reflect this meaning (if the 
existing text doesn't make this clear)?

a 424 only, but with a LocationErrorValue that's in section 4.3 of 
the existing version.

no, it does not mean this.

fair

<mumble> .... but I want to make a point here that this is what's going on....

Do you have an alternate text suggestion that conveys this meaning, 
but isn't so blatant?

Dan, Hadriel,

I don't think that having a proxy insert the session-id would be
workable.

Take the following example.

UA-A does not support the session-id so it is not included in the
original request.

UA-A        Proxy1        Proxy2       Proxy3         UA-B
  |            |             |            |             |
  | INV B (F1) |             |            |             |
  |----------->|        INVITE B (F2)     |             |
  |            |------------>+----------->+------------>|
  |            |             |            |             |
  |            |        200 OK (F3)       |             |
  |   200 OK   |<------------+<-----------+<------------|
  |<-----------|             |            |             |

F1 INVITE B@home.com
   Call-id: 123456789
   From: <a@example.com>;tag=98765
   To: <b@home.com>
   Contact: <A@192.164.1.1>
   
F2 INVITE B@home.com
   Call-id: 123456789
   From: <a@example.com>;tag=98765
   To: <b@home.com>
   Contact: <A@192.164.1.1>
   Session-id: abcd1234

F3  200 OK
   Call-id: 123456789
   From: <a@example.com>;tag=98765
   To: <b@home.com>;tag=56789
   Contact: <B@164.192.23.35>


Note that as UA-A here does not support the session-id that this has
been inserted by Proxy1.

What happens however if UA-B now tries to SUBSCRIBE to UA-A using the
dialog event.

Assuming the dialog event has been modified to allow the session-id.

UA-A        Proxy1        Proxy2       Proxy3         UA-B
  |            |             |            |             |
  |            |        SUBSCRIBE (F4)    |             |
  |            |<------------+<-----------+<------------|
  |            |             |            |             |

The problem here is how the SUBSCRIBE containing the dialog event
containing a session-id ensures that the new Request on a new dialog is
handled by Proxy1 to map the session-id to the call-id, to-tag, from-tag
format of the dialog event as handled by UA-A.

[If I may be flippant?]. It looks like there is a requirement for a new
header: "Pass-to-this-proxy-at-some-time" to ensure that the correct
proxy is included in the messaging sequence.

You could possibly use a ROUTE header but as UA-B does not know which if
any of the proxies inserted the session-id it would be necessary to
insert all the proxies which inserted themselves in the Record-Route of
F2 as Route headers in F4. This could however result in a lot of proxies
which would not normally want to see the SUBSCRIBE being involved in the
message sequence.

The issue is not as complex for a B2BUA as UA-B could use the Contact
received in F2 as the R-URI in the SUBSCRIBE (F4) which if the B2BUA
mapped the Contact would ensure that the B2BUA which inserted the
session-id would receive the new request.

Hi Ian,
Thanks for your comments.  I should publish the update to this draft, because it now covers the middlebox-insertion-case in text, whereas before it was implicit.  And it adds text for UAC generation that was incomplete, because I forgot to put a critical aspect to this in the original draft about matching.

The basic concept is that if we want it to be usable as an alternative dialog-matching mechanism for out-of-dialog requests, then whomever generates a session-id has to have a local session-id lookup table, as does any device needing to perform matching.  That table would simply be a session-id value to dialog table, used for matching the value to a dialog.

If a device doesn't do this, then we get the troubleshooting properties but not the dialog-matching one, if a request gets to that specific node and the real dialog+tags don't match.

But it's true this would mean a Proxy that generates it *and* wanting to provide the matching property would need to be record-routing and have such a table, making it more stateful.

With regard to the issue not being as complex for B2BUA's because UA-B would send it to the B2BUA's contact:
Just being a B2BUA doesn't solve the problem without the match table being done somewhere.  The problem with dialog-event and such in out-of-dialog requests is not that B2BUA's can't "fix" it and set the contact to themselves to make sure they get the request - they do that already.  The problem is some of the requests aren't sent to their contact-URI to begin with.

For example, in the Derive case it's sending it to the From-URI, which B2BUA's sometimes do also change (ugh), but normally/hopefully to their domain not their hostname/IP; or better yet they leave it alone.  [I think that Derive is actually incorrect in sending it to the From-URI AoR, because it means the Derive message can end up at any contact for the AoR]

But the bigger issue is even if such things get sent to Contact-URIs and the Contact-URI's are GRUU's, in theory the GRUU does not specify a specific B2BUA instance, but instead the whole domain and thus can hit any number of B2BUA's getting into that domain.  We have been asked by some people in the IETF to leave contact GRUU's alone, and not replace them with the B2BUA's contact.  We'd be happy to do that if we can make requests going to the GRUU work, which without this type of matching mechanism they won't.

Ultimately the matching and troubleshooting properties work best if UA's generate the session-id themselves, and I hope it's simple enough that they do - but in the meantime B2BUA's or stateful proxies can do it for them to get it off the ground.  It won't solve all scenarios, but that's ok - it's making it better than nothing.

[JRE] My feeling is that we should either remove PRACK or add some
explanation of how a UAC should behave if it receives a 424 to a PRACK
request (taking into account that there is an unacknowledged reliable
18x outstanding). I will go with the majority as to which of these two
options we take.

[JRE] From my understanding of the ABNF for hostport, it cannot contain
"@". I don't know why you think this is allowed in a Via header - I
could not find any evidence.

[JRE] I need agreement on what can go in the inserted-by field before I

[JRE] Yes, I know they are consistent, but I think they are wrong.

[JRE] If we are making a normative statement about what a UAC or proxy
can insert in other header fields, that should appear in the section
dealing with UAC or proxy behaviour respectively. If we are just
reminding the reader that other header fields cannot carry a LbyR URI,
we should not use RFC 2119 language. For the latter case, just changing
"MUST NOT" to "should not" would suffice.

[JRE] If we are trying to assist the UAS implementer, we should not use
RFC 2119 language. We should rephrase something like "A
"used-for-routing" parameter, once inserted by an entity, should not be
removed by any downstream entity and should reach the UAS".

[JRE] Yes, I understand the reason for it - it just needs to be
reworded.

[JRE] So again, RFC 2119 language should not be used. We should say
something like "Multiple locationValues received in a request will
appear in the order in which they were inserted by upstream entities."

[JRE] This might not be clear to the reader. Elsewhere we have a
statement "In the spirit of informing implementers of B2BUAs and SBCs,
each 
   server type really should adhere to the above proxy guidance with 
   respect to the "Routing-allowed" header parameter"
If we had similar statements about other aspects of proxy behaviour that
B2BUAs should adhere to, I think that would be better. Then the sentence
on which I commented could be deleted.

[JRE] This is the section on proxy behaviour. A UAS implementer will not
necessarily look at this section, so we should not make normative
statements about UAS in this section. The term "SIP servers" includes
UASs, and therefore I have a problem with it.

[JRE] I find this rather obscure, but I won't press the point if

[JRE] So make it clear what is meant, rather than just saying "will

[JRE] Well, there are no IETF police to ensure that a proxy conforms to
proxy requirements, and no IETF police to ensure that a UA conforms to
UA requirements, but we don't bother to remind the reader. So why remind
the reader in this case? I would prefer just to delete the phrase.

Hi,

If there is no technical reason I don't see why we again shall make a
restriction which we later may "suffer" from.

I let the dialog run for some 57 messages, hoping to see some  
convergence.

What I am hearing is the vast majority of people feel that the  
presence of a Recv-Info in an INVITE, 200 OK, or OPTIONS is sufficient  
to signal the UA supports the new Info Framework.  There are a few  
hold-outs - speak now with strong use cases for a generic Option Tag  
or hold your piece.

I am also hearing that it would be useful to give guidance to Info  
Package authors for when they may wish to define a Require tag for  
their package, a'la MSCML.  Again, this would be guidance, not a  
normative structure, as Option Tags already have a pretty nice  
definition.

Am I missing anything else?

Thanks.

Hadriel,

May I take issue with your final statement "It won't solve all
scenarios, but that's ok - it's making it better than nothing."

Having something incomplete may be worse than nothing. We may have a
scenario where the partial solution gets implemented and then it will be
impossible to implement a final solution as you are required to be
backward compatible to the partial solution.

Let's try and get all the known problems out of this before it is
published. If as a result it only specifies the originating UAC
including the session-id then so be it. I don't want to get to a point
where middle node insert of modify the session-id and then have to
continue to support that scenario into the future.

That is not to say that all the problems will be identified. That only
happens when someone else tries to do something else in the future.

Subject: RE: [Sip] FW: I-D Action:draft-kaplan-sip-session-id-00.txt

Hi Ian,
Thanks for your comments.  I should publish the update to this draft,
because it now covers the middlebox-insertion-case in text, whereas
before it was implicit.  And it adds text for UAC generation that was
incomplete, because I forgot to put a critical aspect to this in the
original draft about matching.

The basic concept is that if we want it to be usable as an alternative
dialog-matching mechanism for out-of-dialog requests, then whomever
generates a session-id has to have a local session-id lookup table, as
does any device needing to perform matching.  That table would simply be
a session-id value to dialog table, used for matching the value to a
dialog.

If a device doesn't do this, then we get the troubleshooting properties
but not the dialog-matching one, if a request gets to that specific node
and the real dialog+tags don't match.

But it's true this would mean a Proxy that generates it *and* wanting to
provide the matching property would need to be record-routing and have
such a table, making it more stateful.

With regard to the issue not being as complex for B2BUA's because UA-B
would send it to the B2BUA's contact:
Just being a B2BUA doesn't solve the problem without the match table
being done somewhere.  The problem with dialog-event and such in
out-of-dialog requests is not that B2BUA's can't "fix" it and set the
contact to themselves to make sure they get the request - they do that
already.  The problem is some of the requests aren't sent to their
contact-URI to begin with.

For example, in the Derive case it's sending it to the From-URI, which
B2BUA's sometimes do also change (ugh), but normally/hopefully to their
domain not their hostname/IP; or better yet they leave it alone.  [I
think that Derive is actually incorrect in sending it to the From-URI
AoR, because it means the Derive message can end up at any contact for
the AoR]

But the bigger issue is even if such things get sent to Contact-URIs and
the Contact-URI's are GRUU's, in theory the GRUU does not specify a
specific B2BUA instance, but instead the whole domain and thus can hit
any number of B2BUA's getting into that domain.  We have been asked by
some people in the IETF to leave contact GRUU's alone, and not replace
them with the B2BUA's contact.  We'd be happy to do that if we can make
requests going to the GRUU work, which without this type of matching
mechanism they won't.

Ultimately the matching and troubleshooting properties work best if UA's
generate the session-id themselves, and I hope it's simple enough that
they do - but in the meantime B2BUA's or stateful proxies can do it for
them to get it off the ground.  It won't solve all scenarios, but that's
ok - it's making it better than nothing.

I think I was one of the people at the meeting who argued against it, so I'll talk turkey:

INFO is in wide use today, and it works(!), with barely any interop problems.

IMHO, the requirements driving the INFO packages draft was to solve two specific problems with current INFO:
1) Negotiation/advertisement of INFO uses, so that a UA is not "surprised" when it gets an INFO, and we don't need system configuration for every UA we talk to for what it can do.  Configuration on a system-wide basis is one thing, but configuration per far-end is *really* bad.
2) Indication of what the use is for the INFO message that is sent, so that one can receive the INFO method without ambiguity as to its purpose.

Those are the only things that drove a new draft, AFAIK.  Anything else is basically gravy.

We also had consensus (I think) a while back that the only chance we have to make people use this draft instead of current INFO was to:
a) Keep it simple.
b) Keep it simple.
c) Keep it simple.

So ISTM we don't have room for gravy - we need to focus on slice of the pie that we care about.  We need to keep the weight off the draft by sticking to the meat of the problems being solved, without stuffing in extra capabilities and by skipping the extra portions.  If we pile on more features, and mash in scenarios not covered by current INFO, there's little chance current systems/implementers will digest this thing and we'll end up with a dead duck instead.  So I was one of the people that cried fowl at the last meeting, and suggested we scrape the extras off our plate so we can serve up a draft people can really swallow.  Otherwise they'll continue doing what they're doing now.  We can shop around for more features the day after the draft is done, by putting extras in packages - but having people buy into those is only possible if we make the base draft cheap to implement now.

I appreciate wanting to solve all possible scenarios (who doesn't! :), but I am fairly confident there is no possible solution to solve all possible scenarios.  I am also fairly certain we can't even anticipate or document all possible scenarios.

ISTM the only way to solve all possible scenarios is to have all B2BUA's stop changing call-id's and tags - in fact, to not have B2BUA's at all.  Because that is the assumption all RFC uses of callid+tags have made so far.

At this most recent IETF there appeared to be consensus that the real world has B2BUA's... LOTS of B2BUA's, of various flavors/roles/behaviors, from many vendors.  And there appeared to be consensus that we should try to make things work with them, as much as pragmatically possible.

I can't argue that some future mechanism can't be better than the session-id mechanism, obviously.  But I would point out the session-id mechanism would not prevent future mechanisms, any more than current call-id+tag usage prevents the session-id mechanism.  It would be a "if session-id match fails, then try this new thing if you understand it", or it could even be a "try this new thing first, and only if that fails or you don't understand it then try this session-id thing".  Every extension to SIP can have those properties as far as I know.  It just may need a parameter or new header to accomplish it.

But I also don't want to spend 4 years trying to come up with and standardize a perfect solution, and have the problem last for those 4 years plus whatever time it takes to actually deploy the new solution.  I'd rather have running code in weeks or months, and deployment as soon as possible - even if it means only some of the scenarios are covered but not all scenarios.  (and that's not a comment against your comments - I'm just noting that's how long things take when they're anything more than really simple)

Hi,

I agree to both a) and b), and even c) :)

But, my question is still: what makes support of multiple packages
un-simple? Based on the discussions we had on the list before the IETF
meeting, I thought there were no problems.

Regards,

Christer

Subject: RE: [Sip] INFO Framework - one pakage per INFO

I think I was one of the people at the meeting who argued against it, so
I'll talk turkey:

INFO is in wide use today, and it works(!), with barely any interop
problems.

IMHO, the requirements driving the INFO packages draft was to solve two
specific problems with current INFO:
1) Negotiation/advertisement of INFO uses, so that a UA is not
"surprised" when it gets an INFO, and we don't need system configuration
for every UA we talk to for what it can do.  Configuration on a
system-wide basis is one thing, but configuration per far-end is
*really* bad.
2) Indication of what the use is for the INFO message that is sent, so
that one can receive the INFO method without ambiguity as to its
purpose.

Those are the only things that drove a new draft, AFAIK.  Anything else
is basically gravy.

We also had consensus (I think) a while back that the only chance we
have to make people use this draft instead of current INFO was to:
a) Keep it simple.
b) Keep it simple.
c) Keep it simple.

So ISTM we don't have room for gravy - we need to focus on slice of the
pie that we care about.  We need to keep the weight off the draft by
sticking to the meat of the problems being solved, without stuffing in
extra capabilities and by skipping the extra portions.  If we pile on
more features, and mash in scenarios not covered by current INFO,
there's little chance current systems/implementers will digest this
thing and we'll end up with a dead duck instead.  So I was one of the
people that cried fowl at the last meeting, and suggested we scrape the
extras off our plate so we can serve up a draft people can really
swallow.  Otherwise they'll continue doing what they're doing now.  We
can shop around for more features the day after the draft is done, by
putting extras in packages - but having people buy into those is only
possible if we make the base draft cheap to implement now.

Current INFO use doesn't support this capability, so why do we need to add it?

Hi, 

>>But, my question is still: what makes support of multiple packages
un-simple? Based on the discussions we had on the list before the IETF
meeting, I thought there were no problems.
>
>From a protocol perspective: you'd have to define that more than one
package name can be indicated in an INFO,

Sure. You allow a list of values in the Info-Package header.

>that they have to use cid or some means to identify which body part is
which package's,

Based on the e-mail discussions with Paul, I thought each package was
going to have a unique Content-Disposition value. Has that changed?

But, how is package identified in the case there is only one package,
but still multipart (which you DO say must be supported)?

>and you'd have to handle the case when the receiver can process
one/some package body parts but not another.  It's not truly "free" to
add this.  
>It adds time and complexity to the draft.

Isn't the generic handling of body parts described in the body-handling
spec?

>For example, what if you received an INFO with two packages of the same
package name?  Is that ok?  Which gets processed first?

That's up to the application using the package to decide.

>From a developer's perspective: you'd have to read a bigger RFC and
grok more; and handle more execution paths or at least more logging
events/cases and possibly more configuration than your current INFO

AFAIK there is nothing which prevents you to from using multipart with
INFO today, is it?

Trust me, I want all this to be simple, but I also want to be able to
answer when someone asks be why it is not allowed :)

Regards,

Christer

Ignoring the multiple *packages* per INFO for this email - this one is about multiple *body parts* per INFO.

Was there consensus/hum on documenting that explicitly in this draft, in Minneapolis?

Of course the INFO message has to support multiple body-parts, as does any SIP message.

The question is:
1) can we just say in the draft it must support it and point to the relevant RFCs, or...
2) do we have to explicitly describe how it's supported/handled for INFO in particular?

Doing 2 implies handling multiple body-parts has some unique issues for INFO.

Since the Subscribe/Notify RFC does not have any such text, AFAICT, I fail to see what is unique about INFO package usage from Subscribe/Notify event packages or even just MESSAGE messages, with regards to handling of multiple body-parts.
I have tried to glean that answer from the numerous emails about this issue, but they were intertwined with multiple packages per INFO, and I can't seem to find the answer.

I think it might be worth some effort to attempt an agreement by which 
B2BUAs don't have to change callids. For instance, agree on some form of 
callid that b2bua's can recognize as "safe" - not including domain names 
that might leak some "proprietary" info about the source network.

	Thanks,
	Paul

But I would point out the session-id mechanism would not prevent future mechanisms, any more than current call-id+tag usage prevents the session-id mechanism.  It would be a "if session-id match fails, then try this new thing if you understand it", or it could even be a "try this new thing first, and only if that fails or you don't understand it then try this session-id thing".  Every extension to SIP can have those properties as far as I know.  It just may need a parameter or new header to accomplish it.

I'd rather have running code in weeks or months, and deployment as soon as possible - even if it means only some of the scenarios are covered but not all scenarios.  (and that's not a comment against your comments - I'm just noting that's how long things take when they're anything more than really simple)

Hadriel,

I agree that the problem of identifying which body part is the info 
package is not a unique problem to INFO.

It is however a problem that hasn't been clearly and adequately 
addressed in any of the RFCs, leading to the need for the body handling 
draft. As we move forward we are well advised to do a better job of what 
we now realize is not quite as simple as people had assumed, mostly 
because they rarely thought about multiple body parts.

I agree that we ought not have *special* normative language in one 
draft, for behavior that should be general. But IMO it is still 
advisable to provide informative language about this. And, there does 
need to be *some* way to associate the info package semantics with the 
proper body part(s). Hence the cid reference in the Info-Package header. 
The alternative would have been a special Content-Disposition, which I 
suggested. Either would work, and Eric preferred the CID reference, 
which is fine with me.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Multiple packages breaks the easy, 95% case: what if I have only a  
single body part, and it is the Info Package payload? You only get  
Content-ID when you have MIME. We would have to mandate MIME for every  
new Info Package implementation.

Not a pain in theory, but for speed of adoption, I am willing to bet  
most folks with quasi-proprietary INFO usages, like MSCML and MSML,  
would much rather add a single header (Recv-Info) and use all of the  
rest of the SIP machinery they have in place rather than having to  
hack the application.

As far as handling one good and one bad Info Package: that is actually  
a total non-issue (sorry Hadriel).  The SIP stack understands the Info  
Packages by virtue of indicating Recv-Info, there being an Info- 
Package header, and the body being of the correct type. If there is a  
single Info-Package that was not advertised in a Recv-Info, tough: the  
whole SIP transaction fails (the INFO request). If all of the Info- 
Packages are supported, but the contents of one of them is bad, tough:  
the SIP transaction succeeded (200 OK). It is up to the application to  
handle the particular bad package payload. That is 100% identical to  
what the UAS does if it receives a single well-formed, but bad, INFO  
request. Send the 200 OK and let the application sort out the body.   
SIP has done its job - don't be a layer violator and conflate an  
application error with a transport error!

Yeah that's what I was hoping we could do too a while ago.  But it appears that won't succeed - B2BUA's are changing them for other reasons than just the security one.  One reason I know of is to track separate dialogs they create, ironically.  But I really don't know all the reasons they're doing it - there are lots of vendor devices doing it, and it's clear they're not all doing it for security purposes.

Doing this in a new header has another advantage over that as well, fwiw - if we mandate not changing "safe" call-id values, all b2bua's along the path have to stop changing it, and the UAC has to create a "safe" one.  If we do a new header, only some b2bua's need to change for matching to work in most cases.  All of them would need to pass the header for it to work, but my assumption is that's more likely.  It may be a false assumption, but from the traces I get to see, it looks like new headers get through fairly often. (at least those without URI's)

Hi, 

>Multiple packages breaks the easy, 95% case: what if I have only a
single body part, and it is the Info Package payload?

We DO say that one must support multipart, don't we? So, even in the
one-package-only case one needs a way to find that Info Package.

How is that done, and why doesn't that work also for multiple info
packages? That's all I need to know :)

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I also preferred the special Content-Disposition. And, since C-D is per
MIME, I see no difference in having a single package or a mutlipart with
multiple packages - each package will have an associated C-D.

The CID mechanism also works, but I think we would need that even if we
only allow a single package, but at the same time still allow mutlipart.

Regards,

Christer

Hadriel,

I agree that the problem of identifying which body part is the info
package is not a unique problem to INFO.

It is however a problem that hasn't been clearly and adequately
addressed in any of the RFCs, leading to the need for the body handling
draft. As we move forward we are well advised to do a better job of what
we now realize is not quite as simple as people had assumed, mostly
because they rarely thought about multiple body parts.

I agree that we ought not have *special* normative language in one
draft, for behavior that should be general. But IMO it is still
advisable to provide informative language about this. And, there does
need to be *some* way to associate the info package semantics with the
proper body part(s). Hence the cid reference in the Info-Package header.

The alternative would have been a special Content-Disposition, which I
suggested. Either would work, and Eric preferred the CID reference,
which is fine with me.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Again, this is why I said, "technically easy."

However, it mean more package work, which the *work group* (not me)  
said, "hard - please punt."

I'm not, at least I don't think so. :)  I said it adds protocol complexity to handle failure of processing of more than one info package body-part in a single INFO.  Why?  Because we would have to specify what order they get processed in, because that may affect what happens in the application layer.  When it's just one package for an INFO, we don't have to say anything.
But anyway that one piece was a minor point. :)

I'm not a developer, but ISTM that alone means more code complexity and test cases than a single one, and certainly more than current INFO usage in the wild.

Fine, assume we go for one package only: in the case of multipart, how
do I find the package? 

You have started a separate thread on that, so maybe we can move this
discussion there.

I guess there should also be some guidance text for defining feature
tags, in case one wish to be able to use them in order to reach
terminals which supports specific info packages.

Yup, we must reference that draft - no debate there.

If we don't support multiple packages, then I assume the case for multiple body-parts in an INFO is what I'll call the "piggy-back" case.  You've got something going on that piggy-backs its bodies onto messages of all/any type.  Like for example sipfrag or geo-loc.  Right?

So let me ask this: how would one handle multiple body-parts in SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, or MESSAGE as defined today?  Or in INFO today?  MESSAGE, for example, has native support for text/plain and message/cpim, so what if the piggy-backer happens to use one of those content-types in a MESSAGE request?

I think/guess there are three possible answers:
1) We have to go back and update Sub/Not and Message for them to do CID's as well.
2) We make only piggy-backers use CID for their body parts.
3) We say "don't do that".

Would (2) work??

I'm with Eric: cid handling has to be done for other things anyway, so if we *have* to do something let's keep it to CID.

If there is a single body part, how do you know it is the Info Package 
payload? If it is a *type* that would be valid as the info package 
payload, that may be circumstantial evidence, but is not a guarantee. 
Certainly the Content-Disposition might have an impact on it, but since 
you haven't defined the use of C-D for info packages, I don't know 
exactly how to treat that.

IMO, if you are going to use a CID reference, then you should *always* 
use a CID reference to define the part, even if it is the only part. If 
you don't want to do that, then I suggest we instead use C-D to define 
the info-package body part, which will then be easy as long as we only 
permit a single info-package.

Are you saying we can't have a Content-ID in the sip message itself, 
applying to the whole body? We allow other Content-* headers in sip 
messages. Its always been my interpretation that a SIP message is a 
special case of a mime message, and hence can have any mime headers.

If you want to do it that way, then I suggest we use C-D (with a new 
disposition type) to define the info-package, and make that new 
disposition type be the default CD for INFO messages.

I don't think I agree with this, but it could stand some further 
discussion. Are you asserting this behavior is special for INFO? Or that 
it is true for all messages?

In the case of INVITE and UPDATE with SDP session bodies, we certainly 
fail the message because of bad SDP syntax or even semantics when the 
type is right. (488/606 responses for example.)

I don't find anything in 2976 that calls for a success response when the 
content of the body is incorrect.

	Thanks,

If we don't support multiple packages, then I assume the case for
multiple body-parts in an INFO is what I'll call the "piggy-back" case.
You've got something going on that piggy-backs its bodies onto messages
of all/any type.  Like for example sipfrag or geo-loc.  Right?

So let me ask this: how would one handle multiple body-parts in
SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, or MESSAGE as defined today?  Or in INFO today?
MESSAGE, for example, has native support for text/plain and
message/cpim, so what if the piggy-backer happens to use one of those
content-types in a MESSAGE request?

I think/guess there are three possible answers:
1) We have to go back and update Sub/Not and Message for them to do
CID's as well.
2) We make only piggy-backers use CID for their body parts.
3) We say "don't do that".

Would (2) work??

I'm with Eric: cid handling has to be done for other things anyway, so
if we *have* to do something let's keep it to CID.

Hi,

>Doing this in a new header has another advantage over that as well,
fwiw - if we mandate not changing "safe" call-id values, all b2bua's
along the path have to stop changing it, and the UAC has to create 
>a "safe" one.  If we do a new header, only some b2bua's need to change
for matching to work in most cases.  All of them would need to pass the
header for it to work, but my assumption is that's more 
>likely.  It may be a false assumption, but from the traces I get to
see, it looks like new headers get through fairly often. (at least those
without URI's)

As Hadriel said earlier, there are many reasons why b2bua's change the
call-id, and they would probably continue doing so no matter how "safe"
the call-id is...

Regards,

Christer

I think the whole SIP protocol is a good example of how a too much permissi=
ve =

design creates more interop issues than a more restricted design.

p.s. I did it by hand obviously, so I'm just guessing on content-length and such.  And I have no idea if the geo-loc stuff I created is right - I can't seem to find one example SIP message with it in a draft, and it's damn confusing. (and an impressive amount of overhead to describe a latitude+longitude, address, or well-known string)

Oops, spoke too soon.  There's a sip-location-conveyance draft and it has an example.  Nice.  I sure hope the example in that draft is right, because I'm guessing it will become normative in practice. ;)

I think it defining valid syntax without carefully defining the =

corresponding semantics that is the problem. As long as we define both I =

don't see it as a problem.

Hmm... interesting idea.  So define a single, global C-D value like "package", which all packages use?  Wouldn't that limit what a specific package could do? (like how would you get a package that wants render, vs. icon, vs. one which wants signal?)

Yeah there's no debate that SIP expects INVITE/UPDATE to be handled integral with body processing.  What's always been argued is how to handle things like MESSAGE, SUB/NOT and INFO.  Several people have argued the body part content of those was at a higher layer.  The text in SUB/NOT RFC only defined a response code for bad Event-types or unknown body content-types I think, but left body processing failure out of it.  And none of the packages seem to go any deeper as far as I can tell.

Of course in practice some (many?) devices respond with failure codes when body processing fails no matter the method.

Wasn't this debated a couple few ago on this list?

I sort of see the logic although I'm also not 100% convinced by it.

In any event (no pun intended) I don't think the draft adequately deals 
with the implications of this model. If errors occurring at higher 
layers aren't reported as failure of the INFO request itself, it pretty 
much follows that the 200 response to the INFO must include a payload 
that carries info (sorry, pun not intended here either) on the error.

The alternatives would be:
1) Don't report app-level errors. Perhaps OK for simple packages.
2) Report outcome in separate INFO requests going in the opposite 
direction. Seems wasteful and requires additional app-level correlation.

AFAICT the draft has no discussion on how to carry app-level success or 
failure indications. In fact, the table in sec 5.2 indicates that 
Info-Package is allowed in requests only.

Assuming an event package specifies that all INFO requests result in a 
response which is carried in the 200 response, what does that mean for 
the info package negotiation? An implementation might be able to act as 
a sender of this type of INFO but not as a receiver. It still needs to 
understand the INFO responses but presumably it needn't list the info 
pkg in Recv-Info header fields it generates.

Just as an FYI ECMA has defined TR/87, a SIP INFO binding for the 
computer-supported telecommunications applications (CSTA) CTI standard, 
which uses exactly that model. CSTA requests and events are carried in 
SIP INFOs and these INFO requests succeed even if the CSTA request 
fails. For CSTA requests the 200 response to INFO always carry a CSTA 
response and for CSTA events the INFO response has no payload. The spec 
is available from 
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-087.htm.

Thanks,
Anders

Yes, that is what I had in mind.

If it wants bodies like that, which are processed based on their type 
and disposition, it can just include them for processing in their own 
right independent of the method.

For actual info package bodies, the handling should be determined by the 
  definition of the info package, not by the content disposition. If we 
are identifying the body of the info package via cid, then the c-d of 
the info package should be by-reference as defined in the body handling 
draft.

No I think the logic that Eric's arguing for is "you asked for delivery of this package, and I'm responding with 200 ok because it was delivered".  In other words treat INFO as a delivery vehicle, like MESSAGE, and as long as the package was delivered you send a 200 ok, with no correlation to if/when the package was opened and read successfully or not by a higher-layer info-package "consumer".


> The alternatives would be:

Yeah, I think Eric's argument is for (2).  If they need it, they pay for it.

I don't personally care either way - I'm more interested in knowing if current INFO users *need* to have a 200 ok sent back even on content processing failure.  Because if someone needs it, then we should define it that way; anyone else who doesn't and wants to integrate it into the response can still freely send back a 415 or 488 or whatever to the INFO, because the rules for a UAC would not change and none would be the wiser.

But it does mean all drafts defining a specific package would need to put rules in for how to indicate subsequent failure after a 200 ok if they need to, and that sucks. :(

I'm trying to see what Subscribe/Notify does about this, and grep can't seem to find anything.  I wonder if this was not handled in Sub/Not?

Right, only in requests.  Failure of the INFO delivery or package-name type stuff would be in this draft as a request failure; whereas failure to process the package contents (ie body content) would be specified by the drafts which define specific packages.  Presumably they would need to specify error indications in reverse-direction INFO requests, or better yet ignore the error if possible.

In other words treat INFO as a delivery vehicle, like MESSAGE, and as long as the package was delivered you send a 200 ok, with no correlation to if/when the package was opened and read successfully or not by a higher-layer info-package "consumer".

I just reviewed 3428, and I don't read it as saying that a 200 should be 
returned of the message is *received*. It says that the the message 
should be processed according to the rules of sip, and then a final 
response should be returned immediately. It just says the message need 
not be *rendered* immediately (or ever).

It doesn't say that you can't, or shouldn't, check the validity of the 
message and return an error if it is invalid.

Certainly that is a possibility, but only for packages that define a way 
to do that.

That is a good question. I certainly wouldn't *count* on that behavior 
based on the current language.

Yup. For something like DTMF, I would expect to get an error if the body 
is badly formed, not an info in the other direction.

Failure of the INFO delivery or package-name type stuff would be in this draft as a request failure; whereas failure to process the package contents (ie body content) would be specified by the drafts which define specific packages.  Presumably they would need to specify error indications in reverse-direction INFO requests, or better yet ignore the error if possible.

Since any RFC defining piggy-backer bodies need to use CID, is there a reason info-packages have to as well?

Like is this ambiguous for either an info-package or a piggy-backer?:

Oh no of course you *can* check its validity and respond negatively - the question is if you must, or if you can instead return 200 ok even if you couldn't process the content.  I think it was implied in Sub/Not and Message that you could respond with 200 even if you (later) could not actually process the body content successfully.  So for INFO, if we allow you to send 200 even if you can't process the body content, then the packages have to specify what to do in that case (which obviously the package can just say "ignore it, do nothing").

Take DTMF for example - would we require processing before responding?  Or would we allow post-processing?  If the latter, would we need to send an error indication back upstream?  I think we would allow post-processing, but ignore it.  And definitely allow an integrated processing model to return 4xx as well, since that can happen anyway for other reasons.

In other words treat INFO as a delivery vehicle, like MESSAGE, and as long as the package was delivered you send a 200 ok, with no correlation to if/when the package was opened and read successfully or not by a higher-layer info-package "consumer".

Well, in the case of (2) I'd say they'd be overpaying. In my view it's a 
non-starter. People will want to be able to send app-level responses and 
they won't want to go through a lot of extra trouble to do it. And why 
should they? I'm thinking we should allow app-level errors to be 
signalled with INFO error codes and/or allow INFO responses to carry 
responses along the lines of what CSTA does.

I'll be applying the flame retardant now...

Sorry Adam somehow I missed your email,
The idea is to make it something benign enough that operators of B2BUA's would not feel the need to mess with it, with as high a probability as possible, while still have it be usable and useful.  One use for it is simply troubleshooting, but I'd like to make it usable to help resolve some dialog-matching scenarios that B2BUA's currently break.

The properties it needs to have to be as benign as possible, IMO, are:
1) Needs to not identify any identity property of the generator (no IP, no host, no domain, no MAC, no username, etc.).  If those are incorporated into the identifier, they must not be discernible to a receiver of the identifier.
2) Needs to not directly reveal the call-id/tags were changed.  This is in slight conflict with being usable for dialog-matching, but I put text in the latest draft why that's ok and B2BUA's shouldn't care. (and I will publish the latest draft ASAP)

Unfortunately, such a mechanism is not perfect for dialog matching uses.  For one, it needs both ends to support it - if middleboxes support it they can do it on behalf of the ends, but the farther away from the ends they are the less likely the matching will succeed.  It also needs B2BUA's to support it - if a B2BUA doesn't, then the matching won't work if it hits that B2BUA first.  I think that's all ok, because I think that's unavoidable, and it makes things better than they are now.

The other issue with it is a B2BUA can't use the session-id value alone for matching, because it wouldn't know which dialog side to match to (it has a UAS and possibly multiple UAC dialogs for the same session-id).  So the latest draft says matching is done with both the session-id and the remote-tag.  That also solves a security issue, fwiw.  But it means if any middleboxes along the path muck with the remote-tag, they could prevent the matching from succeeding, and we're back at square one.  The only solution to that I see would be to have surrogates for tags too, but I don't want to go that far down the rabbit hole and the draft does not.  If the WG takes this as a WG item, then it's all open to consensus of course.

Hi,

This is what I was afraid of...

I think that having to use URIs in order to recognize the info package
is anything but simple...

Regards,

p.s. I did it by hand obviously, so I'm just guessing on content-length
and such.  And I have no idea if the geo-loc stuff I created is right -
I can't seem to find one example SIP message with it in a draft, and
it's damn confusing. (and an impressive amount of overhead to describe a
latitude+longitude, address, or well-known string)

Hi,

I agree with Paul: it's about documenting stuff in a way so that not only w=
e understand it (eventhough there are RFCs which I am not sure even people =
on the list fully understands :), but also that others understand it. =


I also think that history also shows that having too much restrictive desig=
n can cause problems later.

Regards,

Christer

I think it defining valid syntax without carefully defining the correspondi=

as a problem.

Agreed.  But I don't think we need to.  Legacy INFO is already deployed.  Subscribe/Notify is already deployed.  UPDATE is already deployed. MESSAGE is already deployed.  None of them use a CID for the body part that is germane to their method's context, AFAIK.  It is up to the piggy-backer uses that want to add other body-parts to use CID for their parts.  For example, if you wanted to add a body part for geo-loc to a Notify message that was sent for a presence package, the Geolocation header would contain a CID, not the Event header.

This "problem" already exists for current SIP messages, and it's up to the new extensions that add body-parts to solve it in a backward-compatible way for all message methods.  We don't need to solve it specifically for INFO.

Howdy,
I have uploaded an update to the Session-ID draft, which adds much more text about the topics discussed so far on the mailing list, and some which have not.
As always, comments or concerns are welcomed.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Let us try again.

INFO is a method that *transports* Application-Level "messages".

INFO is NOT a method of Application-Level messaging.

What is the difference?  In TCP, if I send a message, "SIP/2.blah  
blech" to port 5060, TCP will acknowledge delivery of that packet.   
That is like a "200 OK" in SIP.  The process monitoring port 5060, on  
the other hand, will hopefully come back with some sort of "4xx you  
suck" message, encapsulated over TCP, which TCP will acknowledge  
delivery of.

It is bad enough that we are proving Oran's Law: any well-deployed  
protocol becomes a transport protocol. Let us not make it worse and  
make SIP look like Bluetooth with its dozens of profiles for whether  
you are a data device, a speaker, a microphone, a headset (yes, which  
is different than a speaker and a microphone), and so on.

Let INFO be INFO: something that *transports* messages through a SIP  
Proxy network.  Note I say "through a SIP Proxy network."  If you do  
not want to traverse Proxies, use TCP :-)

Don't forget, a Content-ID is a TOKEN, not a URI.  One may use a URI,  
because a URI is a token.

Does anyone read the draft before they comment?  Folks have been  
saying, "What would an INFO with multiple body parts look like?"
READ PAGES 31-32!!!

The example there uses a Content-ID of abcd9999qq and abcd1234zz.   
Does not look like a URI to me...

Eric,

I understand what you're saying but as I said I think it's problematic 
or at least warrants some discussion in terms of where it leads. My 
worry is that it makes it significantly more tedious to build on the 
info-events work and hence invites people to either ignore the whole 
thing or the parts with which they disagree.

So let's take the ubiquitous DTMF example. Someone defines a DTMF info 
event package and they want the recipient of DTMF events to be able to 
indicate to the sender that a particular event could not be decoded. If 
I understand you correctly, the error indication would have to be 
carried in an INFO going in the opposite direction of the DTMF itself.

PROBLEM 1: If errors are to be returned this way it means that both 
parties must signal both "Send-Info: dtmf" and "Recv-Info: dtmf". Hence 
there's no distinction between the sender of DTMF events and the sender 
of responses to DTMF events. Unless the dtmf package is modeled as two 
separate INFO event packages.

PROBLEM 2: In some cases (most likely more often than not) it will be 
necessary to correlate responses to requests. In your model this 
correlation has to be done at the app level, that is, in the INFO 
payload. However, that will make it difficult to use existing formats 
that don't have a convenient place to put such an ID. My employer's INFO 
DTMF payload doesn't have a place to put it.  Another frequently used 
example is the exchange of JPG images for whatever purpose. Again, no 
place to put an app level ID in the INFO payload. You could put it in 
the INFO header put that would be a layer violation, right?

PROBLEM 3: If all events require a response you end up with twice as 
many INFO transactions as is really necessary. That's difficult to 
swallow without a really good reason. We could allow 200 respones to 
INFO to carry INFO package responses with no adverse affects to layering 
so that's not it.

Thanks,
Anders

According to RFC2392, the ABNF of content-id is:

content-id    = url-addr-spec
url-addr-spec = addr-spec  ; URL encoding of RFC 822 addr-spec

Doesn't anyone read RFC2392 before they start using content-id?

...or, are you talking about a content-id specified somewhere else? ;)

Christer

Sounds ok.

But, doesn't the Info-Package header syntax still have to allow the
piggy-backer to:

1) List multiple info packages
2) For each listed info package, provide the cid

?

Actually, Content-Id is defined for MIME in RFC 2045 as:

      id := "Content-ID" ":" msg-id

where msg-id is defined in RFC 2822 as:

msg-id          =       [CFWS] "<" id-left "@" id-right ">" [CFWS]

RFC 4228 registers Content-Id for HTTP. The actual definition of 
Content-Id for HTTP is in

    [20]  Hoff, A., Payne, J., Hapner, M., Carter, S., and M. Medin, "The
          HTTP Distribution and Replication Protocol", W3C NOTE NOTE-
          drp-19970825, August 1997.

Content-Id is not defined for SIP ;)

PROBLEM 1: If you want to receive package Foo, and Foo has asymmetric  
information going the other way, then you want to send Foo-Response.  
Like you say, Foo is not the same as Foo-Response.  Look at KPML as an  
example of how to do this right.

PROBLEM 2: You've got it in one! The correlation MUST be at the  
application layer.  If you have a package that has asymmetric  
information flows, then you have two choices.  The first is that you  
are using a dialog-related application-to-application messaging  
protocol (INFO) because you want to send messages related to *this*  
dialog. Any response belongs to the request. Fairly straight forward.   
Otherwise, if you have a package that is really using INFO for  
tunneling, then it is most likely already doing some sort of  
multiplexing, which means you already need some way of identifying  
what the messages are for and about.

PROBLEM 3: Another winner! If you care at all about performance, you  
would NEVER use INFO!!!!  Come on guys - let's look at DTMF: one to  
sixteen bytes of payload, two thousand bytes of SIP overhead.

Of course, the problems listed below are sort of hyper-theoretical.   
If a UAC cannot get a message as simple as DTMF right, getting an  
error message from the UAS saying the UAC got it wrong is not going to  
help.  I'll bet my next $100 dollars that a UAC that needs hints  
inside of a package to get something as easy as DTMF right will core  
dump when it gets an error.

I feel as if I am swimming upstream with a school of Red Herrings ;-)

But we can't _require_ a fully-layered model.  In other words, all packages have to gracefully handle failure responses to their INFO request which were caused by processing failure.  And if a package really cares about processing failure, then it could also define a way to indicate it in a subsequent separate INFO transaction.

INFO-DTMF is a good example of one that *won't care*.  There's no real point in indicating errors back.  That doesn't mean you can't send back a 4xx immediately in response to the INFO request - you can always do that - it just means we do NOT have to define a way to indicate error after that in an upstream INFO request.

And BTW, any package could define different content-type or body content or whatever for both the normal use and the error indication, so it won't need separate package names for each.  But anyway that's really up to the specific package to handle, not the main draft methinks.

OK, it can be done using two packages. It seems a bit clumsy to me but 
it'll work.

I think we're talking past each other. The problem is not correlating to 
the dialog, it's correlating the app-level response to a particular 
app-level request within a given dialog.

I don't think I buy that. If something can be accomplished with one INFO 
request people are going to wonder why they have to have two.

Obviously, DTMF is not the problem. If you're only targeting 
applications as simple as DTMF then there's no problem. I think we have 
to expect it'll be used for all sorts of things, though, including 
request-response type apps.

That doesn't mean you can't send back a 4xx immediately in response to the INFO request - you can always do that - it just means we do NOT have to define a way to indicate error after that in an upstream INFO request.

Either it's legal or it isn't. It's no good saying it's not legal but do 
what you gotta do. Are you saying the info-events draft should allow UAs 
to return INFO level errors in response to app-level problems?

So a UA would look at both Send-Info, Recv-Info and Accept in order to 
find out what are the info pkg capabilities of the peer? I guess that 
could work.

The gist is...

If one is building request-response type applications, first and  
foremost, why use INFO?  Using INFO says one needs the proxies in the  
path of the messaging.  Sounds like one really needs a rendezvous  
protocol, like SIP, and establish one's own path, e.g., like MSRP.

If one insists on using INFO, one clearly does not care about message  
size, bandwidth utilization, or network element burden. Since 80% of  
the uses of INFO will be for the simple stuff, and the other 20% will  
most likely be over yellow cables (e.g., a media server connected to  
an application server in the same rack), the "extra message" is a tiny  
price to pay to not screw oneself in the future.

Nope.  We've already said we're going to not bother doing multiple packages. (or at least I think people have agreed with that, I hope)
So the next question was on multiple body-parts.  Since INVITE, UPDATE, PRACK, SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY, MESSAGE, and legacy INFO, can all carry bodies and not one of them defined a CID mechanism for the body part that was specific to their message method context, we shouldn't need to for INFO either.

A "piggy-backer" is an extension to SIP that piggy-backs bodies onto any message method types.  Geolocation is an example of one.  Since it's the responsibility of the piggy-backer to handle identifying its specific body-part and dis-ambiguating it from the method's, we don't have to do anything.  In other words, Geolocation would already have to deal with current INFO message and body syntax.

For example, let's suppose someone creates an INFO package for sending virtual location information in a game, using a content-type of application/pidf+xml.  (whether they should have done it in SIP vs. the media layer is orthogonal)  And let's suppose for whatever reason the SIP stack always adds Geolocation information of the UA's physical location.
Here is what it would look like:

The info-events draft has no choice but to allow an INFO request to fail with a failure response code.  ISTM every SIP request type that can succeed can also fail with a failure response code.  I don't think we need a *new* response code.  One could use 415 or 400, or Paul suggested 488.  I would do whatever Subscribe/Notify/Message does in such cases.

And to be clear, I don't think ANY of this needs to be in the base draft.  If someone wants to define a package that has a body which can contain error information, and sends that in an INFO request after getting an INFO request it can't process, why should we say a package can't do that?  And I don't mean that in the sense of "let's be flexible" - I mean it's actually illogical to constrain what a package puts in its INFO message or why, at layer above SIP.  I don't even know how to word such language.  "You MUST NOT define a package which contains error information about your application"?

And I don't think we can reasonably mandate that the original INFO request only be responded to with 200 ok if the entire application processed it successfully.

For example, let's say INFO-DTMF actually cared about an error condition. (I don't think it does, but just for argument's sake)  You couldn't mandate it send that error in the response to the INFO, because there are cases where that would be impossible.  For example, a SIP-H.323 gateway would get the INFO and convert it to H.245-UII.  If we mandate sending back the error for the INFO, it would require waiting for the H.245 message to be successfully received on the H.323 side before sending back any response to the INFO, which can be quite long.  Not only would you get a bunch of retransmissions (if over UDP), but it may exceed the overall transaction timer itself.

I think that's why Subscribe had to send a Notify after subscription, as well.  The processing time for something at a layer above SIP is just not controllable at a SIP transaction layer.

But even given that - it can't stop a INFO-DTMF receiver from sending back a 4xx.

The real question is whether it would be allowed to send back application-layer information such as bodies in the response.  And I have no clue on that.  There's pro's/con's, as usual.

Actually I think we had consensus there would be no Send-Info defined in the draft.  But anyway no I don't think I meant that. :)

Ummm... the UA may not care, but Proxies sure would.  And it's kinda the UA's decision of whether to use INFO or not, not the Proxies'.  If we can keep the message count down while still providing the INFO users with what they need, it would be better IMO.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Response Code for Indication of Terminated Dialog
	Author(s)       : C. Holmberg
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-199-03.txt
	Pages           : 15
	Date            : 2008-12-01

This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog
Terminated, which a SIP forking proxy and a UAS can use to indicate
upstream towards the UAC that an early dialog has been terminated,
before a final response is sent towards the UAC.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Hi,

Based on comments I've received at the meeting, on the list and
off-line, I've put together a -03 version of the 199 draft.

It can also be found at:

http://users.piuha.net/cholmber/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-199-03.txt

The security part still needs text.

Regards,

Christer

Hadriel,

I am not expecting all problems to be solved, just to not introduce new
ones.

I believe that allowing a proxy to include a session-id header will
introduce more problems than it solves.

I know that we have to work with B2BUAs, and I understand the sentiment
behind getting rid of them all together. The ietf work tends to preclude
handling by B2BUAs but based upon the RFC3261 definition of a B2BUA as a
concatenation of the UAC and UAS then all the ietf specifications have
to ensure is that each Request can be routed to the correct B2BUA and
then it is up to the B2BUA to ensure that it performs the correct
actions for the end-to-end service.

Based upon RFC3261 a B2BUA MUST map the call-id as a Call-id MUST be
globally unique. As a B2BUA is a UAS/UAC the dialogs on either side of
the B2BUA are different dialogs and must have different Call-ids.

The major issue which currently occurs is that a PUI is used to try and
route a request which should be directed to specific UA, e.g. when
referencing an extant dialog. To reach the specific UA the Contact
should be used and if a B2BUA maps the Contact as well as the Call-id
then the new Request should route to the B2BUA which can perform its
'magic' to provide the end-to-end service.

The problem at present is that B2BUA behavior is not defined and many
implemented B2BUAs will not perform the correct actions to provide the
end-to-end service.

I appreciate wanting to solve all possible scenarios (who doesn't! :),
but I am fairly confident there is no possible solution to solve all
possible scenarios.  I am also fairly certain we can't even anticipate
or document all possible scenarios.

ISTM the only way to solve all possible scenarios is to have all B2BUA's
stop changing call-id's and tags - in fact, to not have B2BUA's at all.
Because that is the assumption all RFC uses of callid+tags have made so
far.

At this most recent IETF there appeared to be consensus that the real
world has B2BUA's... LOTS of B2BUA's, of various
flavors/roles/behaviors, from many vendors.  And there appeared to be
consensus that we should try to make things work with them, as much as
pragmatically possible.

I can't argue that some future mechanism can't be better than the
session-id mechanism, obviously.  But I would point out the session-id
mechanism would not prevent future mechanisms, any more than current
call-id+tag usage prevents the session-id mechanism.  It would be a "if
session-id match fails, then try this new thing if you understand it",
or it could even be a "try this new thing first, and only if that fails
or you don't understand it then try this session-id thing".  Every
extension to SIP can have those properties as far as I know.  It just
may need a parameter or new header to accomplish it.

But I also don't want to spend 4 years trying to come up with and
standardize a perfect solution, and have the problem last for those 4
years plus whatever time it takes to actually deploy the new solution.
I'd rather have running code in weeks or months, and deployment as soon
as possible - even if it means only some of the scenarios are covered
but not all scenarios.  (and that's not a comment against your comments
- I'm just noting that's how long things take when they're anything more
than really simple)
