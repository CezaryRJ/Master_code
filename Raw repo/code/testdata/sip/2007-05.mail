Proposed text for this subject:

Sending multiple locations (multiple Geolocation headers, or multiple
locationValues in a single Geolocation header is confusing to the UAS.  It
has no way to decide what these mean, and how to use them.  There are a few
exceptions to this general statement.  The UAC may have both a reference and
a value, and may wish to send them together.  The value is the current
location of the UAC when sent, and the reference may be used to obtain a
more current (and possibly more accurate) location later.  Also, a proxy
server may assert location even if the UAC provided location.  In this case,
the inserted-by value would be different.  Finally, applications of location
may specify specific behavior for multiple locations and thus blanket
prohibition of such is ill advised.

Therefore:

A UAC or proxy wishing to supply both a reference and a value, representing
the location of the UAC from the same source, MUST provide a single
Geolocation header, with two locationValues, and an inserted-by value.

Otherwise, and in the absence of application specific guidance, multiple
Geolocation headers and multiple locationValues with the same inserted-by
value SHOULD NOT be used.

different from what?

Do you mean that they differ from each other?

That doesn't work, unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean.

Geolocation: x
Geolocation: y

is exactly the same (syntactic transformation) as

Geolocation: x, y

   Geolocation: x
   Geolocation: y

   is exactly the same (syntactic transformation) as

   Geolocation: x, y

What it must mean is:

	A UAC or proxy wishing to supply both a reference and a value,
	representing the location of the UAC from the same source,
	MUST provide two locationValues, both containing inserted-by
	geloloc-params with the same value.

For example:

   Geolocation: <cid:alice123@atlanta.example.com>;inserted-by=endpoint
   Geolocation: <sips:3sdefrhy2jj7@lis.atlanta.example.com>;inserted-by=endpoint 

or

   Geolocation: <cid:alice123@atlanta.example.com>;inserted-by=endpoint,
       <sips:3sdefrhy2jj7@lis.atlanta.example.com>;inserted-by=endpoint

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

An issue raised by reviewers for location-conveyance was how it works if
the UAS tries to send its location to the UAC.  There are several things
that are problematic with this, including errors: the UAC can't tell the
UAS about an error it finds in the location.

We propose to resolve this by specifying that location-conveyance sends
the location of the UAC.  The header can appear in a message from the
UAS to the UAC, but it means that the UAS is looping back the location
of the UAC. =20

The other end can send its location with an UPDATE or ReINVITE, turning
around the connection (i.e. becoming the UAC).

The loopback procedure is useful when proxies insert location.  The UAC
may not even be aware that it happened, and yet it gets an error or a
result it doesn't understand.  If the UAS echo's what it gets, the UAC
can see it.

If this proposal finds favor with the working group, we will modify the
text in the next revision of -conveyance to incorporate it. =20

This sounds wise to me.

Something that bears further discussion: is an intermediate node 
permitted to drop the location from a response? I think there are 
competing interests here - some intermediate nodes may want to drop it, 
while the UAC would prefer to have it retained.

Yeah, I wanted to limit options.  I wanted two representations of the same
location as a single header.  I'm not really stuck on that, but cutting down
on options is good.

The problem I see, and I may just be imagining this, is that there's  
no way for the receiver of a 302 to know whether it means

1) The party you have called cannot be reached, please try this other  
party.

or

2) The mechanism (scheme) you have chosen to use cannot be used right  
now. Please try this other mechanism.

or

3) You need some additional parameters to reach the party you have  
selected along with the scheme you have selected.

There are heuristics that might apply. For example, if the only  
difference between the R-URI of a request and the Contact of a 302  
response is in the scheme, then we probably have a scheme change.

But with all the parameters appearing on R-URI, that's not a really  
solid heuristic.

I have some concern on the draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-01.

IMHO, in a wireless network, an expensive resource is the air-interface
and an expensive QoS parameter is the end-to-end call set up delay.
Current draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-01 increases message
flows between user agents (UAs) and network in both ends of a call. In
this draft, a UA is directly communicating both with the Proxy and the
Policy servers in both end of the network (in Figure 3 and 4). This will
consume air-interface bandwidth and increase end to end delay of a call.
Note that, in a large country, the distance between a cell phone user
and a office supporting a proxy and policy server is in hundreds of
miles. The UA's policy offer/exchange with the proxy and policy server
would significantly impact the end-to-end call set up delay performance.
A better approach would be direct rendezvous of the Proxy and the Policy
servers through SIP. Generally, proxy and policy server are co-located.
In emerging devices, proxies and policy servers are embedded inside a
single hardware. Direct communication between Proxy and Policy server
would reduce messages (2)/ack, (3), (4), (6), (7), (9), and (10) to two
message exchange in Figure 3.  Similar reduction is possible in Figure
(4).=20

Purpose: In response 
Body: The IETF SIP working group thanks the OMA PAG working 
group for communicating with us in regards to PAG's 
requirements for an XCAP event package.

A design team met in an ad-hoc session during IETF 68, 
and reached the conclusion that a more general solution 
to the problem of change reporting on XCAP documents 
than that provided by the current SIPPING config 
framework draft would be desirable. The team achieved 
consensus on working from the document 
draft-urpalainen-sip-xcap-diff-event-01 as baseline 
text.

It has not yet been determined by the IETF leadership 
as to which working group will develop this event 
package, but current indicators are that this would be 
within the scope of the SIPPING working group, and that 
initial editorial work will be provided in large part 
by Jari Urpalienen.

The largest open issue with this work appears to be 
related to the initial synchronization phase. Questions 
related to this were raised by Jari on the SIP mailing 
list on April 25. The SIP working group would like to 
encourage OMA PAG to participate in this discussion on 
the SIP mailing list and to consider whether the 
limitations of the current mechanism as discussed by 
Jari are acceptable for PAG's requirements.

The general approach of allowing multiple valued headers to appear by 
repeating the header or using comma separated values is quite deeply 
embedded. Making an exception for one header would IMO be far worse than 
being consistent with all the other multivalued headers.

The stacks I know of handle this internally. An exception will require 
more code, not less.

I don't see that the distinction matters. You called URL-1 and are told 
you should try URL-2. You get a hint on the significance depending on 
whether it is a 301 or 302 response. (If the recipient doesn't support 
sip, then 301 is the way to go I think.)

Don't think too hard about it - just do what you are told in this case.

Also, it seems like an abuse of syntax to use groupings of header values 
(which traditionally have no meaning) to indicate groupings of location 
URIs.  If you want to do that, do something like add an 
inserter-tag=rand12345 parameter.

In any case, I don't think we need to go into this much detail for a 
generic conveyance mechanism.  If I may suggest text:

"
Sending multiple locations in a SIP message (i.e., multiple Geolocation 
headers, or multiple locationValues in a single Geolocation header) can 
be confusing to the UAS.  Based on the information in the SIP message, 
the UAS may have no way to make a meaningful choice as to which 
locations to use, and how to use them.  This document defines only one 
mechanism to distinguish among multiple locations, the inserted-by URI 
parameter, which is used to differentiate proxy-inserted and 
endpoint-inserted locations when both a proxy and and endpoint assert 
locations.  Future documents may define additional parameters to express 
other differences.

Beyond these parameters, however, this document provides no other 
mechanisms for distinguishing among multiple locations included in a SIP 
message.  Thus, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that locations be added to a SIP 
message that have the same values for these parameters as locations 
already in the SIP message.  For example, if a proxy receives a message 
that contains a location with inserted-by=server, the proxy SHOULD NOT 
insert additional locations into the message.  For endpoints, this 
recommendation means that a UAC SHOULD NOT include multiple locations in 
a SIP request.  Should a UAC choose to include multiple locations, all 
locations MUST indicate the same physical location, namely that of the 
endpoint.
"

To sum up: This document gives you inserted-by; might be others in the 
future.  Beyond that, there be dragons!

I don't think message-routed-on-this-uri is right to include here, since 
that tag should be applied to all locations to which it applies.

I think this is the correct, unambiguous semantic for the Geolocation 
header.

I'm less certain about how well the loopback will work in practice, for 
the reason Paul noted (you might get push-back on loop-back, haha), but 
as long as it's not a MUST, that's not a big deal.

Hi There,
   
  I have a question regarding to the GRUU and the outbound-08 drafts. In the GRUU draft, it recommends the UA use the sip.instance obtained from the Registrar. But in the outbound-08 draft, it recommended to create a sip.instance (UUID) when doing registration. If the UA supports both GRUU and the outbound, which sip.instance should the UA to use in the INVITE transactions?
   
  Thanks,
  Jerry

Hi Jerry,=20

=20

I believe there should only be one sip-instance in this case.=20

=20

The sip-instance as created by the UA will be unique to that UA instance
(and preserved over software/hardware resets etc.). This is used for
outbound and if a Supported: gruu is present in the REGISTER it is also
used for generating a gruu.

What you are proposing is essentially the "piggyback model". There has=20
been an extensive discussion of the pros and cons of piggyback vs.=20
separate channel in SIPPING. A brief summary of this discussion can be=20
found in Section 4.2 of draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framework-01.

  The sip-instance as created by the UA will be unique to that UA instance (and preserved over software/hardware resets etc.). This is used for outbound and if a Supported: gruu is present in the REGISTER it is also used for generating a gruu.

I'd like to say "Congratulations" to the whole working group, and  
especially to Kevin and Jean-Francois.

It took nine years, but we finally got this thing done.

Hooray!

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

   From: "Rosen, Brian" <Brian.Rosen@neustar.biz>

   An issue raised by reviewers for location-conveyance was how it works if
   the UAS tries to send its location to the UAC.  There are several things
   that are problematic with this, including errors: the UAC can't tell the
   UAS about an error it finds in the location.

Ouch.  That could be quite a problem.

   We propose to resolve this by specifying that location-conveyance sends
   the location of the UAC.  The header can appear in a message from the
   UAS to the UAC, but it means that the UAS is looping back the location
   of the UAC.  

   The other end can send its location with an UPDATE or ReINVITE, turning
   around the connection (i.e. becoming the UAC).

This does seem to be the correct solution.  I suppose you could even
extend this mechanism to include sending an OPTIONS with a
location-conveyance header.

   The loopback procedure is useful when proxies insert location.  The UAC
   may not even be aware that it happened, and yet it gets an error or a
   result it doesn't understand.  If the UAS echo's what it gets, the UAC
   can see it.

Good point.

   From: Paul Kyzivat <pkyzivat@cisco.com>

   Something that bears further discussion: is an intermediate node 
   permitted to drop the location from a response? I think there are 
   competing interests here - some intermediate nodes may want to drop it, 
   while the UAC would prefer to have it retained.

It seems best to require the intermediate node to retain the
location-conveyance.  At least, unless there is no error or warning
referring to it.  But assuming that locations aren't added to messages
frivolously, why would intermediate nodes want to drop it?

   From: "Brian Rosen" <br@brianrosen.net>

   Yeah, I wanted to limit options.  I wanted two representations of the same
   location as a single header.  I'm not really stuck on that, but cutting down
   on options is good.

Permit me to exercise one of my peeves -- though it appears that
limiting the syntax of the header is beneficial, it is in fact
harmful.  You want as much uniformity in header syntax as possible, so
that implementations can use generic parsers to do the low-level
conversion of the character stream to a data structure of
names/values/whatever.  You also want to allow generic "un-parsing" to
convert the data structure to the character stream.  But if you make
ideosyncratic declarations that a particular header does things
*slightly differently* than all similar headers, implementations are
reduced to using custom code to generate every header.

Hi,

Multipart/alternative is interesting. I guess that, for SDP, it could be
used to provide different "offer alternatives". I think it would be good
to compare it against some of the other grouping/alternative mechanisms
we have defined for that purpose.

Regards,

Christer

And so did I, just now.

I have a few comments and questions and a slew of nits.

> Route, Path, From, To, Refer-To, Refer-By, etc.  This specification

Referred-By, I assume.

I had trouble parsing this. Suggestion for modification:

>>> This specification mandates that when a proxy is
>>> forwarding a request a resource described by a SIPS
>>> Request-URI can not be "downgraded" to a SIP URI by changing the=20
>>> scheme, or by sending the associated request over a non-secure

Move "(bob@example.com)" to after "If Bob".


> Furthermore, if Bob wants to ensure that every

Use "to him" instead of "to it".


> However, if Bob had registered instead with a SIP contact header
> field instead of a SIPS contact header field (e.g.,
> sip:bob@bobphone.example.com), then a request to AOR

I suggest this instead:

>>> However, if Bob had registered with a SIP Contact header
>>> field instead of a SIPS Contact header field (e.g.,
>>> sip:bob@bobphone.example.com), then a request to the AOR

Suggestion:

Since this is talking about registration, I assume that "request" should
be "REGISTER request".

What exactly does "a need" mean here?

Suggestion:

>>> 4.1.5.  Usage of the transport=3Dtls parameter

Shouldn't this read "the SIP Contact header field"?


> Proxies can use the sips option-tag in Supported, Require and Proxy-
> Require header fields to detect UAs that do not conform to this

How would a proxy use the Proxy-Require header to detect what a UA
supports?


> The proxy MAY instead map the request with a 416

Where did the word "map" come from? I suggest "respond to".

Suggestion:

>>> Using a Redirect Server with TLS instead of a Proxy has some
>>> limitations that have to be taken into account.


> When a redirect server receives a request with a SIPS Request-URI,

There is no "upgrade" here. Both the request and the registration are
SIPS already.


In the call flow chart in section 5.1, the image for the second 200 OK
for each REGISTER points the wrong way.


In general, I feel that I don't understand the reasoning behind when to
respond 403 and when to respond 404 in this draft.


The rest of my nits is minor stuff like typos, incorrect pluralization,
capitalization errors, etc. I attach a diff below. Note that the diff
also contains a few of my notes (and the above changes), so don't apply
it indiscriminately.

Paul made that point already.  

I'll reword so either two locations in one header or two headers with one
location is acceptable.

   From: "Brian Rosen" <br@brianrosen.net>

   Yeah, I wanted to limit options.  I wanted two representations of the
same
   location as a single header.  I'm not really stuck on that, but cutting
down
   on options is good.

Permit me to exercise one of my peeves -- though it appears that
limiting the syntax of the header is beneficial, it is in fact
harmful.  You want as much uniformity in header syntax as possible, so
that implementations can use generic parsers to do the low-level
conversion of the character stream to a data structure of
names/values/whatever.  You also want to allow generic "un-parsing" to
convert the data structure to the character stream.  But if you make
ideosyncratic declarations that a particular header does things
*slightly differently* than all similar headers, implementations are
reduced to using custom code to generate every header.

Dale

All,

If a UAC performs multiple outbound registrations (reg-id=1 & reg-id=2) and 
uses GRUU, the outbound examples show it uses different Call-IDs. Does that 
mean that the second registration invalidates the temporary GRUU returned in 
the first 200 OK?

In other words: should the temporary GRUU returned for the first Contact be 
the same, or different?

Should outbound recommend to use the same Call-ID for multiple 
registrations? (and different from-tags)?

Regards,
Jeroen

RFC 1035 limits the Domain name field of DNS records to letters, digits
and '-' signs. Some DNS records however (such as SRV records) use
additional characters, e.g. '_' (_sip_udp.someschool.edu).

What is the legality of using additional characters for domain names in
NAPTR records? (e.g. '@', ':').
Is there any RFC or draft, which supports that?

The now-expired draft
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jennings-sipping-multipart-02 explored
multipart/alternative.  One difficulty, however, is what does it mean to say
"can understand a part".

This is easy if one part is SDP and another part is SDPng.  If you
understand SDPng, you process it; if you don't, you process the SDP.

However, it's really hard if one part is SDP and another part is also SDP --
in some cases we would like the answerer to "pick the better SDP".  At the
time, we were considering multipart/alternative as a way to offer RTP
(RTP/AVP) and SRTP (RTP/SAVP), but we found it doesn't work well at all.
Since then, draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation is a superior
solution to sending an offer containing RTP and SRTP.  

I suppose we could avoid the difficulty by prohibiting identical
Content-Types in the alternatives.

The creator of the multipart/alternative has the job of picking which is 
the better one. By definition they alternatives are ordered with the 
preferred one last. (There is an assumption the the the preferred one is 
the least widely implemented, and the least preferred one is the most 
widely implemented.) You are supposed to process the *last* one that you 
are *capable* of processing.

But your point still remains. If there are two SDP alternatives, how do 
you decide if you can implement the last one? You are allowed to ignore 
much of SDP if you don't understand it. But is that supporting it?

Or just clearly define what it means to support one in an alternative.

It's possible/probable/obvious (depending on who you talk to) that 
multipart will have to be supported for emergency calling, in which 
there is an SDP body and a Location message body...

This doesn't mean UAs that *don't* establish voice/video dialogs will 
have to support multipart, just for those UAs that do establish 
voice/video dialogs with emergency response centers (again, depending 
on who you talk to).

By support, you mean such a UA would need to be able to send an 
Invite with a multipart, right?  That is, such a UA wouldn't need 
to necessarily receive or need to parse multipart for the purposes 
of emergency calling.

(It's quite trivial to send multipart, and obviously more difficult
to handle parsing it, especially nested multiparts.  Not impossible --
it's been done for years and years by mail user agents, afterall,
but it's also not slam-dunk easy.)

That won't be multipart/alternative, though, as the location body and the SDP body
won't be alternatives but independent items.   I think they would be
multipart/mixed.  See this from RFC 2046:

5.1.3.  Mixed Subtype

   The "mixed" subtype of "multipart" is intended for use when the body
   parts are independent and need to be bundled in a particular order.
   Any "multipart" subtypes that an implementation does not recognize
   must be treated as being of subtype "mixed".

5.1.4.  Alternative Subtype

   The "multipart/alternative" type is syntactically identical to
   "multipart/mixed", but the semantics are different.  In particular,
   each of the body parts is an "alternative" version of the same
   information.

Right. Mixed is a far cleaner semantic problem than alternative. It  
means "Use all of these that you understand, to the best of your  
ability, and complain if there's nothing you understand."

I agree that multipart/mixed makes sense when you're sending
different content-types and you want the receiver to process each
one that he understands.  This is useful if you're doing an Invite
that includes your location (application/sdp and 
application/pidf+xml [draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance]).

However, if you're sending SDP and SDPng, multipart/mixed does not
make sense.  If you're sending SDP and SDPng, you want the answerer 
to pick one.  For the next decade, anyone that understands SDPng 
will also need to continue to understand SDP.  And we don't want the
receiver to creatively use both the SDP offer and the SDPng offer.

Email is similar:  if you configure Thunderbird or Outlook to send 
messages with text/plain and text/html they are put inside 
multipart/related, not multipart/mixed.

I totally agree.  It seems like multipart/mixed, multipart/alternative,
and possibly multipart/related will be needed for different uses.

It seems that this issue is moot, since SDPng seems to have been 
declared dead.

Don't you mean multipart/alternative?

Argh, yes.  Thanks for catching that mistake.


Anyway - someone needs to run with this multipart/mixed for sure,
and probably also multipart/alternative and multipart/related (per
Ted's suggestion, although I don't see a use case for multipart/
related at the moment).  I no longer have the bandwidth to 
coauthor draft-jennings-sipping-multipart.

IIUC you needn't complain if you don't understand any of the parts.

Rather, the handling parameter of the Content-Disposition header of each 
part needs to be examined. For handling=optional the part can be ignored 
if you don't understand it. For handling=required you need to complain 
if you don't understand it.

So for example, you could have an INVITE that contains a multipart/mixed 
where the parts are:
- a part with Content-Type:text/plain and
   Content-Disposition:render;handling=optional.
- a part with Content-Type:image/gif and
   Content-Dispostion:icon;handling=optional

This should be treated as an offerless INVITE even if neither subpart is 
understood.

The case of location conveyance does present an interesting issue that I 
have wondered about for some time and never found an answer to:

Suppose you are making a call, and for some reason think that providing 
location information will be helpful. But it isn't critical that the 
recipient understand it. So you send a request like:

    INVITE sips:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0
    Via: SIP/2.0/TLS pc33.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK74bf9
    Max-Forwards: 70
    To: Bob <sips:bob@biloxi.example.com>
    From: Alice <sips:alice@atlanta.example.com>;tag=9fxced76sl
    Call-ID: 3848276298220188511@atlanta.example.com
    Geolocation: <cid:alice123@atlanta.example.com>
      ;inserted-by=endpoint
    Supported: geolocation
    Accept: application/sdp, application/pidf+xml
    CSeq: 31862 INVITE
    Contact: <sips:alice@atlanta.example.com>
    Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary1
    Content-Length: ...

    --boundary1

    Content-Type: application/sdp

    ...SDP here

    --boundary1

    Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
    Content-ID: alice123@atlanta.example.com
    Content-Disposition:???;handling=optional

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
           xmlns:gp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10"
           xmlns:cl="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr"
           xmlns:gs="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:geoShape"
           entity="pres:alice@atlanta.example.com">
         <tuple id="sg89ae">
          <timestamp>2007-03-20T14:00:00Z</timestamp>
          <status>
           <gp:geopriv>
             ...
           </gp:geopriv>
          </status>
         </tuple>
        </presence>
    --boundary1--

You need the Content-Dispostion header so that you can insert the 
handling=optional parameter. But what is the content-disposition value? 
None of the currently defined values, such as "session", or "render" 
seems appropriate.

In some sense its content-disposition is irrelevant because the 
processing of the part is determined by the cid: reference in the 
Geolocation header. But a UAS that doesn't understand the Geolocation 
header won't know that.

We have some parts whose handling is governed by their type and 
disposition, without need of explicit reference from another header. And 
we have other parts that shouldn't be processed at all unless there is 
an explicit reference to them elsewhere that has itself been understood. 
IMO there needs to be a Content-Disposition that covers the latter case. 
But that has never been recognized and specified.

This of course is a potential issue even if the body part is there by 
itself, without an enclosing multipart.

There has been no response on this issue, and therefore I consider this
issue closed.=20

The information on self-signed certifications will be removed from
draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance.

(As WG chair)

Henning provided this proposal a few weeks back.

Since then, there have been a number of clarifications on the proposal,
but apparently no alternatives.

I would therefore like to make a consensus call on this issue.

The call is EITHER:

-	To progress location conveyance by documenting the proposal of
Henning in the new version. This is obviously agreement on the
mechanism, than any of the finer details which could change in the
process of documentation and WG discussion.

OR

-	To retain the core of the existing mechanism as documented in
-07 of location-conveyance, addressing the remaining comments as fixes
to the use of the Warning header, and so on.

Unless I header comments otherwise within seven calendar days from this
mail, I will assume working group consensus is to go in the direction of
Henning's proposal.

Note that technical responses and suggestions are welcome on the
proposal, but what I am interested in resolving here is the key
direction to take the location-conveyance document. Therefore please be
clear as to you position on the above question if making any response to
this thread.

Regards

Keith

A summary of where we are on this one.

None of the key points below have been disagreed with, and they are
therefore considered agreed.

One of the comments made on the list was that draft-ietf-pdif-lo may
provide useful information to support this. The editor's and review team
discussed whether draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance should contain a
normative reference to this document. It was agreed that this document
contained provisions that were application specific rather than protocol
specific, and therefore there should not be a normative reference.=20

Brian Rosen then took the action to draft text to agree on the list in
regard to this. That action is still in progress on the continuation of
this thread (see post of 1st May and subsequent responses).

Regards

Keith

Hi,=20

it mean to say "can understand a part".

It doesn't always have to be about picking what is best.

For example:

Assume a terminal supports audio and video. If both audio and video are
used, it supports codecs audio_X and video_X.

However, if only audio OR video are used, the terminal has more
resources available, to it could use the more-resource-using codecs
audio_Y and video_Y.

In this case I don't think it's about picking based on what is "better",
it's about picking based on what will be used for the session.=20

Now, I am sure there are other ways of doing this, but this solution
would not require support of any SDP extensions (multipart/alternative
would of course have to be supported), and the same port number could be
used for the audio and/or media m=3D lines in all alternatives.

Regards,

Christer

Using the same port number on multiple m= lines has been, and
continues to be, a direct violation of several SDP 
specifications.  Even the SDP grouping specification explicitly
calls this out as illegal.

Draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation is 100% backwards
compatible with endpoints that don't understand it.  Multipart/
alternative will never share that characteristic; the last 
SIPIT showed how poorly multipart is supported today and
there is no way, when you build an offer, to know if all of
the answerers will understand multipart/alternative.  HERFP
rears its head, too.

I had thought there was consensus around the need for
draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation -- I am mistaken?

Yes. But in the multipart/alternative example I gave you (and which is
ilustrated in a simple form below) would have 3 individual SDP bodies,
and the same port number would not be used within a single SDP bodies.=20

But, the same port number would be used in each indivudual SDP body, and
as far as I know there is no specification which forbids that.

better is relative and one man's lutefisk is another's cat food.

Perhaps what we need to say here is "preferred by the receiver".

This can be expressed with MMUSIC's capabilities negotiation, though -- and
can be expressed better than with multipart/alternative because MMUSIC's
capability negotiation defines preferences of each m= and each a= line,
whereas multipart/alternative can only ever allow simple "take all of this
SDP" or "take none of this SDP".

(With the specific example you show, of course, you don't even need MMUSIC's
capabilities negotiation -- an answerer that doesn't support video (or
doesn't support audio) can already indicate that in its SDP answer.)

We've lost a bit of context here, but presuming that we're still
talking about multipart/alternative, that's not quite the model.
The preference order is set by the sender, it is explicit that the
receiver should take the first body it can handle.  If  you want
some other semantic (where all of them presented and the
receiver selected among them), I believe you'd have to use
a different MIME type.

The point is that, depending on what media the answerer chooses,
different codecs can be used for chosen media streams.

Yes, "vanilla" SDP allows me to offer audio and video, and the answerer
can incdicate what it does/doesn't support. But, vanilla SDP does not
allow the offer to say: "Here is audio and video. If you accept both
then let's use these codecs, but if you only choose audio then let's use
theis other codec".=20

Christer

I haven't seen any comparision between the mechanisms, so I can't
comment on the "far better" statement at this point.

But, in order to do the same thing with SDP CapNeg, I assume it does
require the remote terminal to actually support SDP CapNeg?

I agree that many terminals don't support multipart today, but wasn't
the initial issue of this thread that we want to mandate the support of
multipart (at least multipart/mixed)?

Also, my initial intention was not to compare multipart/alternative with
SDP CapNeg, but to give an example what multipart/alternative could be
used for.

Regards,

Christer

Ok.  I'll let Flemming or one of the other people deep into the SDP
capability negotiation comment on the virtues of it versus 
multipart/alternative with several different SDP parts.

Yes.  But multipart/mixed isn't useful selecting the 'best' SDP; it's
useful for throwing a bunch of different content types into one SIP
body (SDP and location, for example).

> Also, my initial intention was not to compare 
> multipart/alternative with

I have become convinced, through my efforts with RTPSEC, that 
multipart/alternative is harmful if it contains multiple SDP parts.

So if there is something other than SDP that multipart/alternative 
might help with -- and there very well could be -- throw it out
for discussion.

To summarise where we are on this one.

Looking at the thread, it appears that no one objected to the removal of
the material. There were some questions on what should be removed. This
has been discussed futher by the editors and review team and can be
summarised as (section numbers as in -07 version of
location-conveyance):

-	section 1: keep the paragraph, but to remove the word
"frequently" and strike the last sentence.=20
-	section 4.3: already gone as a result of other decisions.=20
-	section 6 would go in total as a result of this action.

There were concerns that the material would be directly copied into the
ECRIT documents.

Let me state that any material so moved will be rewritten by the
editor's of the ECRIT documents to correspond to the scope of those
documents. Naturally the editor's of the ECRIT documents concerned will
be bound by the normal consensus building activities of the ECRIT
working group, and it is appropriate for any member of the ECRIT WG to
comment on (or disagree with) that text when it appears.=20

Regards

Keith

Correct, but with multipart I meant both mixed and alternative.

Again, I am not in a position to disagree with you ,but is that
harmfulness documented somewhere?

Nope.  If we're going to move multipart/* forward in SIP, though,
I'll be happy to write that section.

I think it will be easier to make progress on multipart/mixed than 
multipart/alternative. It appears that making progress on alternative 
will be difficult without some use cases to help in defining what it 
means to "support" one of the alternatives.

I think we are on to something here. I believe that Paul Kyzivat and Dan
Wing have it
right.

What I'd like to see is something describing the following:

- How to use Multipart/mixed

  I think Paul Kyzivat and Dan had some good explanation in this thread
about it.=20
  We should really make proper treatment of multipart/mixed as mandatory
as we can.=20
  This means, being able to understand parse the nested MIME bodies that
you DO support.
  At a miminum, an implementation should be able to find in a
Multipart/mixed the SDP
  for example. We probably need also to write some recommnedation on
what happens if
  there is multiple SDPs in that multipart mixed.

  It's not pretty out there. I've seen implementations that don't even
send 415
  when receiving multipart/mixed: they just ignore the payload, and
believe
  it's an SDP-less INVITE. They then put an offer in the response, which
the
  real offerer believes is an answer. Then all hell breaks loose.

  Some of them do send 415, but without the supported payload type in an
Accept=20
  header in 415.


- Multipart/alternative

  I agree with Dan that using Multipart/alternative in the way that was
described
  in draft-jennings-sipping-multipart section 5 is in fact harmful.
Especially now that we
  are defining capability negotiation. Section 6 would be OK, but now
that SDPng is gone,
  it's irrelevant.

  What we really need to say is that multipart/alternative may be used
only when we
  are using alternative payload types for the same information. For
example, text/html and=20
  text/xml or whatever. It would be applicable if one day we re-created
another SDPng=20
  for example.

  Section 3.1 explains this relatively well, but is restricted to Offers
(for which we have
  no use cases anymore). I think it should instead talk about other
examples (e.g.,
  text/html, text/xml, or maybe some example with pictures).

  I really believe section 5 goes against the spririt of section 3.1
(specifically, of
  the quote of RFC 2046). What it really has it two application/sdp (one
of them is=20
  encrypted inside a application/pkcs7mime), but really it's still two
application/sdp

  But we should make it clear that it is NOT for negotiating multiple
alternatives of=20
  the same payload type, in particular, not for application/sdp &
application/sdp.
 =20
If we decide to go forward, I'd be happy to help too.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional Event Notification
	Author(s)	: A. Niemi
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt
	Pages		: 22
	Date		: 2007-5-10
	

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables
   receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP
   user agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating,
   refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and
   periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures have a serious
   deficiency in that they do not allow state to persist over a
   subscription refresh, or between two consecutive polls.  This
   inability to suppress notifications of state already known to the
   subscriber results in superfluous traffic in the network.  This memo
   defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to
   condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed
   since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition
   is true, either the body of an event notification or the entire
   notification message is suppressed.

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

In my example earlier it was not about negotiting multiple alternatives
of the same payload type.

But, anyway, if we want to forbid app/sdp & app/sdp we need good
technical justification for that, but my understanding is that Dan
indicated he would be able to provide that.

Christer

I would like to bring up something that isn't discussed much: 
Content-Disposition. I brought it up earlier in this thread for a 
slightly different reason.

One *should not* look for a particular body part of interest solely 
based on the Content-Type. Both the content type and the content 
disposition need to be correct. For instance, a body part with content 
type of application/sdp should not be considered an offer or answer 
unless the content-disposition is "session". (This is confused because 
there are are also defaulting rules for content-disposition.)

*In principle* you could have a multipart/mixed that had to parts, both 
with content-type of application/sdp. This could be quite legal if only 
one of them had content-disposition of "session" and the other had some 
other content-disposition. It would be sufficient for the other to have 
"Content-Disposition:foo;handling=optional".

I realize this is obscure, and it isn't likely that anyone will be 
including an sdp body part that isn't intended to be an offer or answer. 
But we are writing the specs here, and we ought to be complete and 
precise about it.

The perfect example for that is MESSAGE with text/plain and text/html, 
quite analogous to an email message.

I don't have time to take authorship of the document, but I too can 
contribute some text.

Yes, it's obscure, but that's alright.  There is the annoying
backward compatibility issue with lack of Content-Disposition,
too -- RFC3261 section 13.2.1, "Creating the Initial INVITE":

 >  If the Content-Disposition header field is missing, bodies of
 >  Content-Type application/sdp imply the disposition "session", while
 >  other content types imply "render".

That is sufficient justification to include multipart/alternative.

Hi,

The following is not a proposal, but more "brain storming".

Would it be helpful to have a SIP header, e.g. Content-Type-List, which
would list the different Content-Types in a multipart/* body.=20

A node could then first check that header in order to see whether the
multipart/* contains something a specific node is interested in -
without having to parse the full multipart/* body first. It could speed
up the processing in nodes which may have interest only in a small set
of Content-Types.

Comments?

Regards,

Christer

An interesting optimization, but it doesn't appeal to me:

  * if they're out of sync, which one takes precedence (that is, do I
process a Content-Type that isn't listed in the Content-Type-List?)
  * if a UA knew an intermediate box used Content-Type-List, the UA could
use Content-Type-List to make the intermediate box think some sort of
Content-Type is not present.  That additional content-type might contain the
secret of the universe, which the intermediate box really needed to know.
  * looking for "^Content-Type *:" isn't too hard; you don't really need to
bother parsing MIME and looking for nested parts unless there is, in fact, a
content-type you care about.  Per Paul's message, if you only want ones with
Content-Disposition: session, you could look for that string within 4-5
lines of Content-Type; if you found it, then you could parse the MIME in the
body.

Hi,=20

>Content-Type-List?)

The Content-Type contains "multipart/*", while the Content-Type-List
contains the types (app/sdp, app/isup, app/whatever etc) within that
multipart.

Please note that I am talking about SIP headers, not in the MIME bodies
(of course, if a MIME body contains another multipart/*, the header
could perhaps also be used there).

>* if a UA knew an intermediate box used Content-Type-List,=20

Well, this depends on the functionality of the middle-box.

If the middle-box is going to do some kind of policing, or otherwise
verify that the multipart actually contains what is claimed in the
Content-Type-List, it will have to parse the multipart anyway.

I don't think it's that easy. Assume one MIME body contains a SIP
message (or part of a SIP message), or any other protocol which uses the
Content-Type header, which is not the Content-Type header of the MIME
body itself. The same goes for Content-Disposition.

Christer

I'm with Dan on this. Also, this is well trodden ground in email, and 
they haven't found a need for this.

There really isn't any difference between sip headers and mime headers. 
 From a mime perspective the entire sip message is just a bunch of mime 
headers including some that are extension headers.

IMO the servers that care about what is in the bodies should just bite 
the bullet and do the necessary parsing. Frankly, middle boxes shouldn't 
be looking at bodies anyway.

Let me clarify my point about that new Content-Type-List header
being out of sync with the body.  Here is an example -- a SIP 
header containing, among other things:

  From: ...
  To: ...
  Content-Type-List: application/sdp
  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=B

and the body contains:

  --B
  Content-Type: application/sdp
  Content-Disposition: session

  v=0
  ...

  --B
  Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
  
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
  ...
  --B--

In such a situation, a device which supports Content-Type-List in an effort
to optimize its MIME parsing, wouldn't know there is a "Content-Type:
application/pidf+xml" in the body.

Right.

Proxies are supposed to ignore the body, so what sort of devices
which aren't enforcing policy might benefit from the 
Content-Type-List optimization?

Yes, there can of course be false-positives; the same sort of
false positives would occur with Content-Type-List:  it could
list a content-type which is inside of a MIME part you wouldn't
otherwise process (due to the wrong Content-Disposition, for
example).

Hi Dan,

Couldn't you get this out of sync already today?

You get a SIP message with application/sdp, and then the message body
contains something else...

Email does not have the same real-time requirements which SIP has.

My point was that you can't determine what types of MIME bodies you have
simply by taking the whole SIP message and performing a string search on
"Content-Type". Because, some of the Content-Types you will find may not
describe what is in a MIME body - it may be part of the MIME body data.

-----boundary

Content-Type: protocol/sip

To: blahblah@telecom.com
From: dododo@telecom.com
Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
 =20
  <?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?>
     <presence xmlns=3D"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
  ...

-----boundary

In this example the string search will find two "Content-Type", but only
one of them actually describes the content of the MIME body, while the
other is just data inside that body.

Regards,

Christer

Fully agreed that you could get false positives from such
a test!  But you'll never get a false negative from such
a test.  My point was that if you're trying to optimize, 
and also needing to avoid a UA that is lying, doing a 
search of the Content-Type strings is what you want.

No you can't. If the sip message has Content-Type:application/sdp then 
*by definition* the body contains sdp. If it doesn't look like sdp then 
it is just syntactically incorrect sdp. The Content-Type in the message 
is not redundant with one in the body - it is the one for the body.

All that you need to do is reduce unnecessary parsing to an acceptable 
degree. If all you care about is sdp, then it is probably sufficient to 
search the body for the string "application/sdp", and only parse the 
body looking for sdp if you find that. Now and then you may encounter a 
body that contains "application/sdp" without actually containing an 
offer or answer. But as long as that is rare there will probably be no 
problem.

This puts the optimization entirely on the parser without requiring any 
changes by those that add bodies. That is a good thing. It also keeps 
the size of the message from increasing further, which is also a good thing.

I think what we need to do is describe what you are explaining here, but
we need to make sure that we don't introduce backward compatibility
problems.

(e.g., maybe if Content-disposition: session is not present, it is
assumed
to mean session?)

RFC3261 says that already, on page 80:

   If the Content-Disposition header field is missing, bodies of
   Content-Type application/sdp imply the disposition "session", while
   other content types imply "render".

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Requesting Answering Modes for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: D. Willis, A. Allen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-answermode-03.txt
	Pages		: 25
	Date		: 2007-5-11
	
This document defines two SIP extension header fields and associated
   option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the
   requester's preference for user-interface handling related to
   answering of that request.  The first header, "Answer-Mode",
   expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface
   waits for user input before accepting the request or instead accepts
   the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, "Priv-   Answer-Mode" is similar to the first, except that it requests
   administrative-level access and has consequent additional
   authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have
   applicability to applications such as Push-to-Talk and to diagnostics
   like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate
   how the request was handled is also defined.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-answermode-03.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message. 
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then 
"get draft-ietf-sip-answermode-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-answermode-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

This is identical to version-02 that cleared WGLC, except that the  
"requirements" section was removed, since a good many people thought  
it added no value and the PROTO Shepherd objected to using RFC 2119  
requirements language in the requirements section.

I want to make it clear that I view  draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability- 
negotiation as a better solution to the selecting RTP / SRTP problem  
that the draft-jennings-sipping-multipart. (draft-jennings-sipping- 
multipart was premised on the idea that the SRTP keys would be  
transported with S/MIME which is not as good a solution as the DTLS  
solutions). More importantly, the RTP/SEC bofs and MMUSIC WG selected  
draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation as the way forward the  
problem of saying you can do RTP and SRTP but would prefer SRTP. I  
don't want to be opening that debate or anything about transitions to  
the SDPng.

However, even thought we don't need multipart for the above problems  
- I still think we need it so that we have some extensibility model  
for SIP body parts.

PS ... The picking which body to use is not hard - for mutlipart/ 
alternative you use the last one that you understand.

The problem was that an "off path attacker with no credentials" could  
hijack it.

I think the document should also describe SDP, and if someone thinks
alternative doesn't work (or that some other mechanism is far better)
with SDP it should be described.

Also, we now have a number SDP extensions, related to grouping,
alternatives and capabilities, so it would probably somehow be a good
idea to collect a description/comparition of them in some document.

The outbound draft does not talk of what happens when there is a UDP to TCP
switchover due to MTU overshoot. Since the edge proxy cannot initiate a TCP
connection towards the UA, its the UA which should take care of maintaining
the TCP connection with the network and the flows are created only through
registration.
So if I have a UA which primarily performs SIP signaling on UDP but would
like to support TCP only for huge messages (that cross MTU), then as per the
current outbound draft it will have to create a flow for TCP based transport
during the registration itself and create another flow for UDP based
transport by registering from the 5060 port.

I have two notes to the draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-05.=20

=20

1st note:

This draft states the number of stimulated request is equal 2^70 when
the involved endpoint and proxies follow RFC 3261 recommendations. It is
mentioned in sections 2 and 3.

=20

My opinion is, that the number of stimulated requests is another and it
is 2^71 for the given example and 2^(Max-Forwards + 1) in a little
generally way (but still valid only for the given example).

=20

Let follow next calculation example, where an endpoint sends request
with Max-Forwards reduced to 4.

=20

                  |                      Max-Forwards: 4
                 a@P1
               /      \
             /          \                Max-Forwards: 3
           /              \
         /                  \
       a@P2                 b@P2
        / \                 / \
      /     \             /     \        Max-Forwards: 2
     /       \           /       \
   a@P1      b@P1      a@P1      b@P1
   / \       / \       / \       / \     Max-Forwards: 1
a@P2 b@P2 a@P2 b@P2 a@P2 b@P2 a@P2 b@P2
 /\   /\   /\   /\   /\   /\   /\   /\   Max-Forwards: 0

=20

There are two messages with Max-Forwards header set to 3, four messages
with Max-Forwards header set to 2, eight messages with Max-Forwards
header set to 1 and sixteen messages with Max-Forwards header set to 0.
Altogether there are 32 stimulated messages. Request with Max-Forwards
set to 4 is not possible to include because it is stimulating message.

=20

So, the calculation mentioned by sections 2 and 3 is valid only for the
last forking round but it is not number of all produced requests.

=20

2nd note:

Each proxy must handle number of UAS transactions and number of UAC
transaction. Sum of UAS and UAC transactions per proxy is close to
2^(Max-Forwards + 1). When UAS transaction of the stimulating request
will not be counted, the number of transactions handled by each proxy is
the same.=20

=20

Please note that these calculations are valid only for the given
example. In another attack configuration it will be different.

=20

What if there is no service provider at all? SIP phones may perform 
emergency calls on there own - without the need of a service provider. 
Otherwise - if your service provider is down - you can't make emergency 
calls.

sec 14 of sip oubound draft address the situation when the UA could
switchover from UDP to TCP when the MTU size is large. But yes there are
no current deployments that really support the switchover.

Subject: Re: [Sip] query on sip-outbound and sip-connect-reuse


The outbound draft does not talk of what happens when there is a UDP to
TCP switchover due to MTU overshoot. Since the edge proxy cannot
initiate a TCP connection towards the UA, its the UA which should take
care of maintaining the TCP connection with the network and the flows
are created only through registration.=20
So if I have a UA which primarily performs SIP signaling on UDP but
would like to support TCP only for huge messages (that cross MTU), then
as per the current outbound draft it will have to create a flow for TCP
based transport during the registration itself and create another flow
for UDP based transport by registering from the 5060 port.=20

	The reason is that for the server-to-server case, for which=20
	connect-reuse is meant, you can't trust a connection unless both
parties
	are authenticated, and currently the only way to do this in SIP
is to do

	This is not the case with outbound, where Digest authentication=20
	effectively does mutual auth. Of course a better option is to do
one way
	authenticated TLS and then on top of that have Digest
authenticate the
	client.

	I guess. I have no idea why you would want to do that though.

Hi Klaus,

no matter how you call it but there will always be a (VoIP) application 
service provider involved in the emergency services case.
I guess you refer to the SIM-less emergency services case (or 
unauthenticated emergency network access scenario) where the access 
network provider (ASP and/or ISP) also needs to be the (VoIP) 
application service provider.

Ciao
Hannes

Hi Francesco,

Increment in CSeq and new branch parameter would mean it is a new
request and *NOT* a retransmitted request

is correct that on every retransmit, the CSeq is incremented and the Via
branch parameter is changed?

Thanks in Advance

If you are going to maintain a TCP connection for handling large 
messages, then why not use it for all messages?

   no matter how you call it but there will always be a (VoIP) application 
   service provider involved in the emergency services case.

I don't see that this is guaranteed.  E.g., a VoIP mobile phone could
connect to an open WiFi hub at a coffee shop and route a request
directly to the local PSAP through its public Internet interface.  In
that case, the only SIP-aware elements are the mobile phone and the
PSAP.

But haven't all these issues been discussed and settled in the geoloc
WG?

Dale

This document should say that multiple SDPs with multipart/alternative
are NOT
allowed.

It should probably refer to RFC 2046 that explains pretty clearly what
Alternative means, i.e., Multiple version of the SAME information
using different MIME bodies. See 5.1.4/RFC 2046.

E.g., SDP vs SDPv2/NG/whatever-comes-up-next
      text/plain, text/html

Agreed.

That's probably the job of Flemming's capability negotiation draft in
MMUSIC.
I think he's got some wording on it already.

Hi,

We have revised the draft on distributing SIP URIs within a LAN using  
DNS-SD (aka Zeroconf or "Apple Bonjour").  It incorporates the  
feedback on the previous version we received through the mailing  
lists and in the IETF 68.  The list of changes from the previous  
version and the link to the IETF slides are included below.  Feedback  
is most welcome.

    Title      : SIP URI Service Discovery using DNS-SD
    Author(s)  : J. Lee, H. Schulzrinne, W. Kellerer, Z. Despotovic
    Filename   : draft-lee-sip-dns-sd-uri-01.txt
    Pages      : 22
    Date	      : 2007-5-14

    This document describes the Session Initiation Protocol Uniform
    Resource Identifier (SIP URI) advertisement for DNS-based Service
    Discovery (DNS-SD).  Using this mechanism, a SIP user agent (UA) can
    communicate with another UA even when no SIP registrar is available,
    as in a wireless ad-hoc network for example.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lee-sip-dns-sd-uri-01.txt

The slides from the IETF 68 can be found at:
http://www3.ietf.org/proceedings/07mar/slides/sip-11.pdf

CHANGES from version 00
------------------------
* Expanded "Security Considerations" (section 9)

* New "Other Related Mechanisms" (section 7)
   - Comparison to SIP multicast
   - "sip" service type used by Asterisk and Ekiga
   - P2PSIP

* Changes in the "User Agent Client Behavior"
   - Request-URI set from the contact attribute (section 5.1)
   - RFC3263 not followed in resolving host names (section 5.2)

* New "DNS-SD/mDNS Overview" (section 3)

* References to the Contact header parsing rules (section 4.2.3)

Hello Jari,
I have a comments/question related to how your draft
http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sip/draft-urpalainen-sip-xcap-diff-event-01.txt
can be applied in a environment limited bandwidth e.g. where the
subscription is done over an air interface.

As I see it an XCAP document can be quite large. It may also happen that
the changes can be quite rare and not that big.
A user can also have quite many documents that he/she wants to subscribe
for.
My view is that the memory in a client is not  a bottleneck today and
therefore it is quite likely that it is possible that clients will keep
a copy of needed XCAP documents.
The method in the draft ( see 4.7) to limit air traffic is to use the
"niemi-sip-subnot-etags" draft. That makes it possible to supress some
Notifies.
This method has one disadvantage and that is that it is based on one
etag per subscription and therefore not that useful when we are
subscribing for lots of documents in one Sunsbribe dialogue. The method
is useful when nothing has changed, but not that useful for small
changes to large documents as the client needs to do a XCAP GET in order
to fetch the version that the server has.

My proposal is to use a different method to limit the information sent
over the air.
The proposal is that if the client includes a body with all documents
and etags it has, the Notifier shall respond with a Nofify that contains
all XML patches needed to be able to patch the client's version of the
documents to the same version as the server has.=20
If it is possible to send version information for all documents that the
client has stored already in the first Subscribe, the Notifier can use
this information to start to send the XML patches to patch the client
versions to the latest server versions (instead of sending only the link
to the documents ) if the server has such patches stored.=20
If it can not provide the patches, it needs to send the link as today.=20
If the server has the same version as the client, the server can send
the link with the etag just to confirm that it has the same version. =20

Taking an example from OMA; the existing OMA-TS-XDM-Core (see
http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release_program/docs/CopyrightClick.as
p?pck=3DXDM&file=3DV1_0_1-20061128-A/OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V1_0_1-20061128-A.pd=
f
has an xml schema that it is possible to reuse for the version
information from the client, (see
http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/profiles/xdm_xcapDirectory-V1_0_1
.xsd) as it contains per AUID the URIs for a document plus the etag.=20

This proposal will introduce a requirement that the XCAP server needs to
have a optional patch history function to support this function, if not
supported the server can do as in the existing draft.
Comments?

Regards
Anders

Hi folks,
     If a UAC sends a CANCEL request to the UAS, is the UAS under any 
obligation for the order in which it sends it's responses? i.e.:-

It must send the 200 OK for the CANCEL before it sends the 487 for the 
INVITE request.

or

It must send the 487 to the INVITE before it sends the 200 OK for the 
CANCEL request.

Having a look at section 9 of RFC 3261, it makes no mention of this 
which I assume implies that either situation should be dealt is acceptable.

Thanks in advance for any help supplied.

Regards,
    Steve

	If a UAC sends a CANCEL request to the UAS, is the UAS under any 
   obligation for the order in which it sends it's responses? i.e.:-

As Paul says, it doesn't matter how the responses are sent, because
the network could reorder them before they are received.

Hi Jari,

I have some thoughts and questions regarding the XCAP Diff Event draft
(draft-urpalainen-sip-xcap-diff-event-01).
What will the notification look like if a requested document cannot be
found? No body or only <xcap-diff> element? What does it mean if a
notification contains the document element with doc-selector but no etag
attributes?=20
OMA has implemented an architecure where the XCAP server has been split
up into so called XCAP Document Management Servers (XDMS). Each XDMS
handles separate AUIDs. If a subscription is for several documents
distributed over several XDMSes (different auids), what should then the
notification look like if there are some documents that don't exist or
directories that are empty and there are some documents that cannot be
reached because one XDMS does not answer?
According to RFC 3265 the "pending" value of the Subscripton-State
header indicates that the subscription has been received, but that
policy information is insufficient to accept or deny the subscription at
this time. Is the intention in section 4.7 in the draft that the
subscription state should be pending if the resource the subscription is
for cannot be found? What would then the subscription state be for a
subscription for white space separated resources where some can be found
and some cannot be found?
Generation of a "first full response" notification might take time
especially if the subscription is for several AUIDs, spread over several
XCAP Document Management Servers, at the same time. Is there a need for
an "initial" initial notification that may be sent to the subscriber
before the "full response" can be sent?
Chapter 4.7, second paragraph
It is unclear to me what is meant by "...it MUST fall back to sending
all component changes again for this resource." Is the intention that
the server shall send a "full response" as in an initial notification
(my preferred interpretation)? Or is the intention that the server shall
send several notifications with the patches not aggregated?
Best regards,
Sofie

Hi,

> I have become convinced, through my efforts with RTPSEC, that 
> multipart/alternative is harmful if it contains multiple SDP parts.

yes; alternatives, capabilities, etc., in SDP should be expressed using 
(potentially new) SDP mechanisms (e.g., SDP attributes). I agree that 
multipart/alternative should not be used for two SDP bodies.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi,

> Section 6 would be OK, but now that SDPng is gone, it's irrelevant.

I have seen a few statements like this on the list lately. SIP intends 
to be, by design, session-description-format agnostic. Therefore, we 
need a mechanism that allows endpoints to try and use different 
session-description formats even if SDPng is dead.

Experimenting with new session-description formats is part of the 
innovation process we want to have in SIP.

In short, I do not think such a mechanism is irrelevant only because 
SDPng did not succeed. We still need such a mechanism.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi,

yes, Paul and I talked about writing a draft to clarify a few issues 
that relate to content dispositions in SIP a while ago. We were quite 
busy at that point and did not have time to write it, but maybe it is 
time to do it now.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi Gonzalo,

I guess the question is whether we want to write a document specifically 
focused on Content-Disposition, or if we want to combine work on that 
with work on specifying use of multipart.

They aren't the same thing, but content-disposition becomes more 
significant when there are multiple body parts, so there is some 
justification for combining the work.

Yes, that's exactly what I was saying.

It's perfectly consistent with the intent of what Multipart/alternative
is supposed
to mean.=20

(As WG chair)

The following represents the notes of the second conference call we held
to review comments.

Regards

Keith

Notes of review team call on WGLC comments on draft-ietf-sip-location-
conveyance-07 held on 1st May 2007

1)	Roll call

The following participated in the call.
Richard Barnes
Keith Drage (moderator and scribe)
James Polk (document editor)
Brian Rosen (document editor)
Henning Schulzrinne
Hannes Tschofenig

2)	Agenda bash

Proposed to go through the action items, followed by the remaining
agenda items=20
from the previous meeting, following by any other issues from the
comments that=20
the editor's considered needed input from the review team.

3)	Action points from previous review team discussion

Action 1/1: Keith to take above list to WG for consensus call, as
direction to=20
the editors.

Done. Action complete on Thursday 3rd May.

List was:
-	location conveyance should support the delivery of multiple
locations;
-	the document will make no recommendations as to how the
recipient chooses=20
which location to use. This is regarded as specific to the using
application,=20
and therefore beyond the scope of the protocol extension;
-	the recipient should attempt to make use of all the locations
given, and=20
should only respond with a 424 response if it is unable to use any of
those=20
locations. This includes resolving all and any locations by reference;
-	as a result of the above, any 424 response is a collective
statement about=20
all the locations given in the request rather than any specific location
in the=20
request.

One of the comments made on the list was that draft-ietf-pdif-lo may
provide=20
useful information to support this. It was therefore discussed whether
draft-
ietf-sip-location-conveyance should contain a normative reference to
this=20
document. It was agreed that this document contained provides that were=20
application specific rather than protocol specific, and therefore there
should=20
not be a normative reference.=20

Brian questioned whether there should be more than one reference in the
same=20
provided-by. Proposal was that SHOULD NOT add multiple locations. Brian
agreed=20
to draft text to send to people on his proposal.

Action 2/1: Brian to draft text on whether multiple locations should be
added by=20
the same provided-by.

Action 1/2: Hannes to send text to editor's and review team covering
this issue

This issue being, it is known limitation that when a proxy inserts a
location by=20
reference, that the UA user is not a rule maker (RFC 3693 specifies the=20
rulemaker). There is some suitable text in the RELO document that covers
the=20
same issue.

This issue was still to complete.

Action 1/3: Brian to provide text relating to the usage of TLS.

This issue was still to complete.

Action 1/4: Hannes to send text (can be just key points to be covered)
to=20
editor's and review team covering this issue.

This issue concerned the adequacy of the security conditions.

This issue is still to complete.

Action 1/5: Keith to post to list stating that the agreement is to
remove and=20
asking for WG consensus.

This action was done to complete on Thursday 3rd May.

Action 1/6: Keith to send mail to Cullen Jenning / Jason Fischl
regarding the=20
need of draft-ietf-sip-certs to provide any documentation on this issue.

This action had been done. No reaction so far.

Action 1/7: Keith to send mail to list asking for WG consensus to
agreement to=20
remove emergency call text from location-conveyance.

This action would complete on Thursday 5th. It was agreed that the
conclusion on=20
this action would specifically address Ted's concerns and Keith would
ensure=20
that he does agree with this conclusion.

Action 2/2: Keith to summarise emergency call decision to list, and also

correspond directly with Ted to ensure he is part of WG consensus.

With regard to the paragraph in section 1 it was agreed to keep the
paragraph,=20
but to remove the word "frequently" and strike the last sentence.
Section 4.3=20
had already gone as a result of other decisions. Section 6 would go in
total as=20
a result of this action.

Action 1/8: Brian to post proposed procedures to list for covering the
above,=20
and obtain WG consensus to this proposal.

This being:

-	location-conveyance in responses to give location of the UAS
would be=20
specifically removed from the document. This should be done by a
subsequent=20
request in the opposite direction.

-	that location in responses would relate to location of UAC for
test, but=20
this would be a new procedure. This would need to be considered by the
WG in a=20
list discussion.

This action was still to do. Needs to be decided (on list) if the echo
is all=20
locations or just the one used.

Action 1/9: Henning to draft strawman proposal and initiate discussion
among=20
review team in order to get the concepts correct, prior to SIP WG
discussion.

This action specifically related to the new procedures for error
handling.

Henning had drafted a proposal to the list on this. Keith would initiate
a 7 day=20
call on this.

Action 2/3: Keith to initiate a 7 day call on Henning's error handling
proposal.

4)	Continuation of agenda from previous discussion

Previous agenda 11)	PIDF-LO usage

	Comments: 121, 153A
	Key questions:
	Point usage deprecated?
	Proxy usage - what can proxy say about this location - is this
in scope of=20
this document or does GEOPRIV need to handle it?

This had been partly discussed in the previous call.

James proposed to keep Geo example and to keep the old 4.3 example
(location by=20
reference). He would move the old civic example into a new appendix.=20

In the geo example, point would be updated to position, and therefore
aligns=20
with GML 3.1 This should incorporate all Martin's comments in this area.

Comment 153A had been partly covered by the action items. Proxy addition
has to=20
be determined on context. Additional work may have to be done in future
outside=20
the scope of this WG item. It was suggested that future work would allow
the UAC=20
to request the proxy to insert a location on it's behalf, but this work
would=20
only be done if people think it is desirable. therefore agreed to make
no=20
recommendations on proxy usage.

previous agenda 12)	URI issues

Comments: 7, 64
Key questions:

In regard to comment 7, the review team had no answer to the question
but=20
decided it did not impact the contents of
draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance.

previous agenda 13)	Routeing query allowed issues

Comments: 11
Key questions:

Brian agreed to seek resolution of this comment on the GEOPRIV list, as
this is=20
essentially an UPDATE to a GEOPRIV document. The complete list of WGLC
items for=20
Brian to resolve as this action is 6, 11 and 26.

Action 2/4: Brian to address the issues relating to "Routeing query
allowed=20
issues" GEOPRIV list and seek consensus there as to if and how this
should be=20
documented.

previous agenda 14)	Retransmission allowed issues

Comments: 61A
Key questions:
	Is mechanism needed?

In regard to the proxy adding location, it was agreed that this is=20
underspecified. Route-query-allowed is the new parameter, but
retransmission=20
allowed is the RFC 4119 parameter.

Agreed that this also needs to be resolved with the (old) agenda item
13) issues.

previous agenda 15)	Terminology usage

Comments: 1, 19, 43A, 101A, 116B, 129A
Key questions
-	Are "by value" and "by reference" the appropriate terms?
-	Is LbyR a using protocol?
-	Are there any circumstances where we need to talk about LIS
rather than LS?

In regard to the "by value" and "by reference" concern, noted that by
value is=20
XML and by reference is URL. In location-conveyance, the Geolocation
header=20
field is always a URL. Various discussions around use of "internal" and=20
"external", "direct location" and "indirect location". Whether we should
do this=20
by definitions, or by inventing new terms?

Action 2/5: Henning to make strawman terminology proposal to the review
team.=20
Also need to check as part of this discussion whether all instances of
the=20
existing terminology should be changed or just a specific subset.

There was no current agreement on this, so the document remains
unchanged in=20
regard to this terminology issue unless specific proposals can be
agreed.

In regards to the "LIS" usage, it was agreed that all remaining usages
of this=20
could either be deleted or renamed, so that we do not have to mention
the names=20
of the servers. In the examples, "lis" would become "ls".=20

previous agenda 16)	Pull mechanisms

	Comments: 25, 144A
	Key questions:
	Are the mentioned pull mechanism valid, given that we don't
cover them at=20
all?

Location by reference is not push. It was however agreed that the
editor's would=20
try and delete all references to "pull" and "push" as it appeared that
this was=20
a concept that did not help the document, i.e. use words like "defined a

mechanism for conveying the location", rather than "push".

5)	Other issues

It was identified that we use the term "conveyance" without explaining
what we=20
mean by it. Either define, or change to a new term. Pointed out that the
first=20
sentence of document defines it.

6)	Conclusion

No immediate need seen for another review team call. We have action
items to=20
work out, and list consensus calls to complete, and the authors then
need to=20
provide a new draft and a summary of the comment handling.

WG chairs and editor's will decide what future action is required by the
review=20
team.

This I-D seems to be a difficult read.  It's like reading code, it
describes all the mechanics, but there is no description at the
beginning saying what the point of the mechanism is.  (Unless you're
already familiar with the problems DNS-SD is supposed to solve,
maybe, but this is the SIP WG.)

It seems like an improved organization would be:

- description of the overall problem and the activities that the
  mechanism supports

- information that a UA is expected to possess, e.g., display name,
  SIP URI, etc.

- description of the mechanisms to carry out the supported activities

What if you want to use sips where possible but don't mind a fallback
to sip?

So, if someone makes a call using sips in request URI and
the called person doesn't have a sips URI registered, I guess the
proxy will return 404 not found.

So then then caller might say, ok, there isn't a sips URI, I will now
try a sip URI and see if that works.

The problem is that the called person might not have registered anything
at all.  So in such cases, the 2nd call attempt using sip is a waste.

Is there a requirement for some kind of new SIP response code which
says something like "no SIPS URI registered but there is a SIP one"?

What are the potential problems with this idea?

Regards,

	Attila

Sorry... found my answer....


While guessing a SIPS AOR from a known SIP
   AOR and using it to initiate a request is a valid thing to do, doing
   the opposite (i.e., guessing a SIP AOR from a SIPS AOR and using it)
   is not a valid thing to do as it would be a security downgrade.

   Although "downgrading" from SIPS to SIP is disallowed, it is possible
   that a redirect server or UAS sends a 3XX response to a request to a



Audet                   Expires October 15, 2007                [Page 8]
=20
Internet-Draft                    SIPS                        April 2007


   SIPS URI with a contact header field containing a SIP URI.
   [RFC3261]/8.1.3.4 states that if the UAC decide to recurse to the SIP
   URI, it "SHOULD inform the user".  When a proxy is handling the 3XX,
   it can obviously not indicate anything to the user that it is being
   redirected from SIPS to SIP: therefore, proxies would not be able
   recurse on the contact header field, and instead would either forward
   the 3XX to the UAC or reject the request.

embarassing.

it's very quiet on sip@ietf.org today.

Shouldn't there be some people arguing about sips or something?

Nah, we solved all that stuff. And we're tired of arguing about  
location conveyance.

Below is a draft that proposes a correction to the definition of 503 
(Service Unavailable) responses in RFC 3261. The goal of this draft is 
to avoid some of the problems that have been identified with 503, 
however, it does not attempt to provide a full blown overload control 
solution.

Comments, thoughts are highly appreciated.

Thanks,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.


	Title		: Essential Correction to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 503 (Service Unavailable) Response
	Author(s)	: V. Hilt
	Filename	: draft-hilt-sip-correction-503-00.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 2007-5-14
	
   Overload occurs in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) when SIP
   servers have insufficient resources to process all SIP messages they
   receive.  The SIP protocol specified in RFC 3261 provides the 503
   (Service Unavailable) response code as a remedy for servers under
   overload.  However, the current definition of 503 (Service
   Unavailable) has problems and can in fact amplify an overload
   condition.  This document proposes an essential correction to RFC
   3261 that avoids these problems and helps SIP servers to better cope
   with overload.

I wonder if it would be worth making an explicit suggestion in the  
SIPS that proxies provide a 302 if they receive a SIPS request for an  
AOR for which they have only a SIP binding? We could also make a  
stronger recommendtation that if you don't know whether an AOR is  
SIPS or SIP you would try SIPS first and expect a 302 if you guess  
wrong. This could reduce the inclination for people to try SIP first.

This seems very helpful (perhaps even "required" - I don't know how UACs 
know how to fall back without this type of guidance).

Thanks,

Although there are no examples, i'm proposing Suppress-Notify-If-Match:

it is useful to allow to suppress the notify, when you want to just send 
some rpc-commands to the other end. And certainly it doesn't do what you 
want, if it were to be used with content sync with several http resources.

With http you can do instance manipulation (rfc3229). But it requires 
versioning support on the XCAP server, which is overkill for the problem 
at-hand, imo 
(<http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg18920.html>). So 
sure you could add an even more sophisticated stuff with sip here by 
combining or listing locally already existing resources. So you could 
optimize this but you would add yet more complexity and "interesting" 
error cases... Also if you had every resource in sync you would 
practically send the same information within subscribe body what you 
will receive now within the initial notify (and of course, upstream 
speed may be much slower than downstream).

good catch, actually the current xcap-diff format requires at least one=20

This is not defined in xcap-diff format, as it is sort of an error case=20
with documents. With xcap-component subscription it is somewhat vague.=20
When etags are included, you could e.g. do a conditional replace based=20

Good question. I could do a counterquestion, why did OMA do that, and=20
instead let the implementations figure these out ? I mean this=20
introduces a lot of complexity and several difficult error cases. But=20
the intention here (in the i-d) is to do what is typical in the ietf,=20
i.e. just to define the interface and let the implementations do the=20
rest. But back to the question, the i-d says that you send in the=20
initial notify request what you can "read", so probably you could still=20
compose this from separate responses from several xdms, as results from=20
different auids should be orthogonal. But hey, I really wouldn't=20

While using "pending" I was wandering that I'll produce somewhat=20

In practice, I wouldn't anticipate that you would need this empty body=20
or neutral body notify, i.e. clients will most likely keep the state=20
information based on the response of subscribe. But the spec allows to=20
use it although null body interpretation with content-type header _is_=20

The latter, after sending the http reference, the server does not know=20
when the client has really read the content, thus no aggregation allowed=20
with "rapidly changing resources"

If we need any more motivation for this work, here is a quote from 
draft-ietf-mmusic-file-transfer-mech-02.

    The MMUSIC working group considered a few alternative
    approaches before deciding to use the encoding described in
    Section 6.  In particular, the working group looked at the MIME
    'external-body' type and the use of a single SDP parameter.

    A MIME 'external-body' could potentially be used to describe the file
    to be transfered.  In fact, many of the SDP parameters this
    specification defines are also supported by 'external-body' body
    parts.  The MMUSIC working group decided not to use 'external-body'
    body parts because a number of existing offer/answer implementations
    do not support multipart bodies.

I don't think we can hold that work hostage until there is better 
support for multipart. But that means there is one more thing that has 
been screwed around because of the lack of multipart support.

	Paul

Yes, that has been added to the current working draft.

But, it's not necessarily 302 (it could be 301 for example). And certain
proxies may elect to just plainly reject it. That's all covered in the
current
working draft.=20

Volker,

Can I explain why you believe that for "small" servers (supporting < 20
clients) you believe
that the retry after is problematic? I don't think it's that clear from
the draft.

And if so, would there be a way to mitigate the oscillation while
allowing the Retry-After?

I'm a little concerned about a rule that seems somewhat vague on this.=20

   You mean like a 302?

Is a 302 allowed to offer a sip: URI as a contact for a sips:
request-URI?

380 looks like it is intended to have this sort of effect, but its
content has not been standardized:

21.3.5 380 Alternative Service

   The call was not successful, but alternative services are possible.

   The alternative services are described in the message body of the
   response.  Formats for such bodies are not defined here, and may be
   the subject of future standardization.

And 416 seems plausible:

8.1.3.5 Processing 4xx Responses

   If a 416 (Unsupported URI Scheme) response is received (Section
   21.4.14), the Request-URI used a URI scheme not supported by the
   server.  The client SHOULD retry the request, this time, using a SIP
   URI.

But I can't tell if that last sentence is just a nit and should have
read "... this time, using a SIP or SIPS URI."

Dale

Francois,

> the draft.
> 
The problem of 503 with Retry-After is described in greater detail in 
Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of draft-ietf-sipping-overload-reqs-00. In short, 
503 with Retry-After may lead to the oscillation of traffic a server 
receives and the shifting of load between servers.

> And if so, would there be a way to mitigate the oscillation while
> allowing the Retry-After?
> 
The proposed changes 5. and 6. would still allow a Retry-After header, 
although it would be restricted to a single request.

An alternative to proposed change 1. (i.e. to not recommend the use of 
Retry-After in 503) could be use a Retry-After value based on 
milliseconds. This would provide a more fine grained control to 
overloaded proxies and may avoid some of the problems the current header 
has. It would work for servers irrespective of the number of clients. 
However, it would change the semantics of the Retry-After value.

Overall, the goal of this draft is not to introduce a new overload 
control mechanism (which certainly should avoid traffic oscillations) 
but rather to see how far we can get with modest changes to the existing 
spec.

(As WG chair)

This is to announce a Working Group Last Call on

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-session-policy-framew
ork-01.txt

The WGLC is for 3 weeks and will end on 11th June 2007.

Please respond to the editor, and to the SIP mailing list with comments.

This WGLC is being held in conjunction with the two related documents in
the SIPPING group, see mail below:

Regards

Keith

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------

Hi all,

This is to announce Working Group Last Call on the following documents:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-media-policy-data
set-04.txt  (Recently updated to address the merging issue discussed on
the mailing list)
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-policy-package-03
.txt (Unchanged since prior to IETF-68)

This WGLC will end on 11 June 2007.

Since the WG has previously reviewed these documents, the plan is to
keep the same set of reviewers that previously volunteered:=20
     Bob Penfield, Shida Schubert, Flemming Andreasen, Roni Even
However, anyone additional that would like to volunteer would be
appreciated to get a fresh set of eyes on the document.=20

Feedback should be sent to the authors' email addresses (which is cc'ed
using the tools alias in the above for your convenience) and please copy
the SIPPING mailing list. =20

Note: the original plan was to WGLC this set of documents along with the
framework document that moved to SIP.  So, stay tuned for an
announcement on the SIP list of the WGLC plans for that document.=20

Thanks,
Mary
SIPPING WG co-chair

416 is ok for "SIPS is not OK, but SIP will work".=20

It is NOT ok for "SIP is not OK, but SIPS will works". For that, you can
use 302 or
301.=20

Hi Jari,
I have some thoughts about the synchronization in the client of the
notifications of changes and retrieval of documents over XCAP.
Scenario 1: "No xml patching"
The subscription is in the "no xml patching" mode and a notification
containing a link to a document and a new etag "aaa" is received by the
client. Immediately after the notification has been sent out a change is
made to the document by another client and the etag is updated to "bbb".

The first client makes an XCAP GET request to retrieve the document and
receives a document with etag "bbb" which is different from the one
received in the notification.=20
The client knows how to use the retrieved document until the
notification with the same etag, "bbb", is received and then when
another notification with etag "ccc" is received the client makes a new
XCAP GET request for this document. If the client in the XCAP GET
receives a document with a different etag than "ccc", the client can use
this document as it is newer than the one with etag "ccc". =20
-> Scenario 1 has no issues.
Scenario 2: "xml patching"
The subscription is in the "xml patching" mode and a notification
containing a link to a document and a new etag "aaa" is received by the
client. Immediately after the notification has been sent out a change is
made to the document by another client and the etag is updated to "bbb".

The first client makes an XCAP GET request to retrieve the document and
receives a document with etag "bbb" which is different from the one
received in the notification.=20
The client ignores all notifications until the notification with etag
"bbb" has been received. When another notification with an etag "ccc" is
received the client uses the included patch on his document. I.e. the
client buffers all notifications that arrives while the client performs
the XCAP GET and when the new document is received it applys all patches
with newer etags than the one in the retrieved document.=20
-> Scenario 2 has no issues.
Scenario 3: "Aggregation"
The subscription is in the "aggregation" mode and a notification
containing a link to a document and a new etag "aaa" is received by the
client.=20
The client makes an XCAP GET request to retrieve the document and
receives a document with etag "aaa".=20
Several changes are made to the document by another client and the etag
is updated to "bbb" and then "ccc". A new "aggregated" notification with
previous-etag "aaa" and new-etag "ccc" is received and the client uses
the included patches on his document.
-> Scenario 3 has no issues.
Scenario 4: "Aggregation and unlucky timing"
The subscription is in the "aggregation" mode and a notification
containing a link to a document and a new etag "aaa" is received by the
client. Immediately after the notification has been sent out a change is
made to the document by another client and the etag is updated to "bbb".

The first client makes an XCAP GET request to retrieve the document and
receives a document with etag "bbb" which is different from the one
received in the notification. Another change is made to the document by
some other client and the etag is updated to "ccc".=20
When the "aggregated" notification with previous-etag "aaa" and new-etag
"ccc" is received the client does not know how to apply these patches to
his document.
-> Scenario 4 has issues.
Possible solution:
In the aggregated notification each change that has been made to the
document is represented by a patch operation.=20
Each patch operation is specified together with an etag value. The
client will then be able to only apply those changes that has been made
to the document with etag "bbb" and after.=20
For this to work the schemas for the patch operation elements in
draft-ietf-simple-xml-patch-ops-02 need to be updated with etag
attributes.
In conjunction to the above scenarios I also wonder what the thoughts
with aggregation are. Is the main idea that it should be possible for
the server to "aggregate" several changes on a document into one or
fewer patch elements, i.e. "hide" some of the changes to the client.
This kind of functionality would be very complex to implement and
scenario 4 above would not be solved. If instead the intention is to
"aggregate" several patches in one notification and to reduce the number
of notifications sent then each patch element could also be linked with
the etag of the changed document and solve scenario 4 above. With the
existing schemas this could be done by having several document elements
pointing to the same document but with different etags and one patch
element for each document element. My proposal, which would produce
smaller xcap-diff documents, is instead to update the schemas for the
patch operation elements in draft-ietf-simple-xml-patch-ops-02 with etag
attributes.
Best regards,
Sofie

Well i have implemented a really stupid, but very simple logic in=20
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlpatch>, i.e. there's also an xml=20
diff utility which produces a diff document of two documents (let's say=20
initial and updated document). So i'll disagree that it were very=20
complex to implement (~lk lines of C code). And I'm certain that there=20
are better ways to implement it...

And btw. even for this "very simple" xcap client i'd propose a similar=20
model, i.e. you would produce xcap updates based on diffing, at least my=20
personal experience showed that it was indeed very difficult to combine=20
internal patching and sending proper xcap requests at the same time ;-).=20
I mean all possible error cases and keeping a reasonable state machine...

So we would have etag history in two places ? (and it would mean=20
updating diff format) and would be somewhat shorter format (and even=20
more optimizations are possible). However, I still think the proposed=20
one is the best compromise which allows aggregation. This is definitely=20
a rare case and thus it is fully _optional_ both for the server and the=20
client (and as is xml-patching optional). So the non-aggregate mode is=20
the default mode with patching, but clients may try to use the aggregate=20
mode as well (which isn't as elegant as one would want, but possible).=20
Someday, it may be possible to have also e.g. proper versioning in the=20
xcap server, and then this protocol handshake ugliness disappears with=20
aggregate mode. We might want to optimize xml-patching mode, but that's=20
another thing.
thanks,
Jari

   416 is ok for "SIPS is not OK, but SIP will work". 

   It is NOT ok for "SIP is not OK, but SIPS will works". For that, you can
   use 302 or 301. 

What I like about 380 is that it seems to be designed for situations
where the calling user should be consulted, as opposed to 301/302,
which implementations seem to take as instructions for automatic
redirection.

We've previously issued guidance on consulting users in the case of a  
302. Part of the justification here is that redirecting someone who  
placed a "local" call to a destination for which they would be  
charged "long distance" (or any other situation producing a similar  
differentiation in cost) is something that users would want to be  
informed of and consent to.

Are you suggesting that all such cases might be more appropriately  
dealt with by a 380? If so, how do we prevent malevolent types from  
abusing 302?

I don't agree at all with this 380 idea.

To me, 380 basically redirects the request to a resource described
in a message body instead of (or perhaps in addition to) in the Contact
header.
And, it's not standardized yet.

I do not see anything in the description of 380 (section 21.3.5/RFC
3261)
that implies that the Calling user should be consulted.

Furthermore, RFC 3261 does state that for 3XX response that redirects
from
SIPS to SIP, you should consult the Calling party (see 8.1.3.4).=20

To top it off, since 380 is not defined today, it will be treated as a
300 by all existing UAs. So it really does not solve anything.

Hi, 

I've had a look at this draft, and have a few questions / concerns.  My 
apologies if this is covered somehow in the overload work (I am not 
following it closely), or if I missed some discussion going by. 

Basically, I think there are some potential problems with ambiguity, and 
also no good way to tell the client where (or if) to go somewhere else for 
service.  Specifically: 

o 500 would become overloaded to mean either "something bad (but 
unspecified) happened" or "go somewhere else (maybe try again later)", but 
it seems impossible to determine which case it is.   The name of this code 
implies only the former. 

o 503 changes its meaning to "I'm overloaded, back off (optionally don't 
try again for some time)".   But this is not the name of this response -- 
it is Service Unavailable.  The trouble is, there are many reasons why 
service may not be available, overload being just one.   (Yes, I know this 
issue is raised as OPEN ISSUE 3  in the draft itself.) 

Proposals: 

1.  Can a new 5xx response code be defined specifically to handle overload 
scenarios, instead of overloading 503 / 500?  This would have the explicit 
semantic of "I'm overloaded, back off (optionally for some time)".   It 
could also have additional info on how the client should handle it (see 
next).  503 would keep its original meaning (go somewhere else), and 500 
would keep its meaning (something bad happened). 

2.  Add a new header, to explicitly list one or more servers to go get 
service from, usable (at least) in 503 and the new 5xx, maybe 500 also. 
With this, 503 could have the additional semantic of "go somewhere else, 
and here's where" (optionally with a time to retry here).   New 5xx could 
have the additional semantic of "I'm overloaded, go here instead" 
(optionally with a time to retry here). 

I can certainly see cases, even in overload handling, where the current 
server may want to explicitly send the client somewhere else, effectively 
redirecting to a different server. This could be either to an explicit 
server (or list of them), or just "go try somewhere else, you figure it 
out".   Also handy for maintenance operations and for load sharing,

<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Hi, &nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I've had a look at this draft, and have
a few questions / concerns. &nbsp;My apologies if this is covered somehow
in the overload work (I am not following it closely), or if I missed some
discussion going by. &nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Basically, I think there are some potential
problems with ambiguity, and also no good way to tell the client where
(or if) to go somewhere else for service. &nbsp;Specifically: </font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">o 500 would become overloaded to mean
either &quot;something bad (but unspecified) happened&quot; or &quot;go
somewhere else (maybe try again later)&quot;, but it seems impossible to
determine which case it is. &nbsp; The name of this code implies only the
former. &nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">o 503 changes its meaning to &quot;I'm
overloaded, back off (optionally don't try again for some time)&quot;.
&nbsp; But this is not the name of this response -- it is Service Unavailable.
&nbsp;The trouble is, there are many reasons why service may not be available,
overload being just one. &nbsp; (Yes, I know this issue is raised as OPEN
ISSUE 3 &nbsp;in the draft itself.) &nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Proposals: </font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">1. &nbsp;Can a new 5xx response code
be defined specifically to handle overload scenarios, instead of overloading
503 / 500? &nbsp;This would have the explicit semantic of &quot;I'm overloaded,
back off (optionally for some time)&quot;. &nbsp; It could also have additional
info on how the client should handle it (see next). &nbsp;503 would keep
its original meaning (go somewhere else), and 500 would keep its meaning
(something bad happened). &nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">2. &nbsp;Add a new header, to explicitly
list one or more servers to go get service from, usable (at least) in 503
and the new 5xx, maybe 500 also. &nbsp;With this, 503 could have the additional
semantic of &quot;go somewhere else, and here's where&quot; (optionally
with a time to retry here). &nbsp; New 5xx could have the additional semantic
of &quot;I'm overloaded, go here instead&quot; (optionally with a time
to retry here). &nbsp;</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I can certainly see cases, even in overload
handling, where the current server may want to explicitly send the client
somewhere else, effectively redirecting to a different server. This could
be either to an explicit server (or list of them), or just &quot;go try
somewhere else, you figure it out&quot;. &nbsp; Also handy for maintenance
operations and for load sharing, possibly others. &nbsp;Lack of an explicit

[Taking off my RealNetworks hat and putting on my IMTC CTO hat...]

Sorry if you get this multiple times,

A while back there were some threads going on pre-existing IPR for IP
telephony and I encouraged people to drop the topic on the reflectors due to
the unknown impact it may have on your causes to discuss and share
information in that manner.  Today I wanted to follow up by letting you all
know about a valuable resource from IMTC which you can both leverage and
help strengthen:

The IMTC has an IPR AG which is developing a Multimedia Standards Historical
Archive which contains contributions to standards meetings, reports, records
of IPR licensing declarations, copies of standard organizations patent
databases, publications such as journal articles, books, etc.

See below for the process to contact the IMTC Secretariat if you think you
have actual historical documentation that can benefit the archive. (or for
that matter, want to join IMTC so that you can leverage the archive!) While
the mail below is targeted at member companies, we also encourage
non-members with documentation of interest to submit via the same process
indicated below.  (Please don't reply to this mail to the misc
reflectors...)

Thanks,

Chris Steck
CTO of IMTC

Subject: [imtcmembers] IMTC Multimedia Standards Historical Archive -
contributions?

Dear IMTC Members,

Many of you are aware of the existence of the IMTC Multimedia Standards
Historical Archive and an increasing number of you are regularly consulting
it.

The IMTC Multimedia Standards Historical Archive contains contributions to
standards meetings, reports, records of IPR licensing declarations, copies
of standard organizations patent databases, publications such as journal
articles, books, etc.

Much of this information originated 10 to 25 years ago. Due to the huge
amount of information, and the difficulty to find old documentation,
archives containing this kind of information are incomplete, and must be
built up step by step. For example, the ITU keeps fairly good records on
ITU-T SG level, but none on the Rapporteurs Group level, which is the most
important for IPR work. In addition, prior to 1995, the majority of records
were still paper, making them almost inaccessible for today's purposes.

Thanks to contributions made by members, we are slowly building up the IMTC
archive. We would like to encourage members to submit their own old archived
records to the IMTC to help us adding value to the historical archive. These
contributions can be made in paper form, scanned copies of documents, or
electronic files. Anything related to our industry that can help us complete
our existing documentation is useful. We kindly ask members, willing to
submit their records, to first send a list of documents to the Secretariat
(jpolizotto@inventures.com). This will allow the IPR Activity Group to check
if those documents are not already archived in the database and that way
avoid submission of numerous duplicate records.

For any questions on the Historical Archive or submissions of documents,
please feel free to contact Jim Polizotto, IMTC Secretary
(jpolizotto@inventures.com).

Thank you and best regards,

Patrick Luthi
IMTC Vice President

The changes proposed in the draft should not affect the 500 response 
code. In which respect would there be a change to 500?

503 means that the "server is temporarily unable to process the request 
due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server."

It seems that 503 is working reasonably well for maintenance but not for 
overload. So the question is if we can change the overload behavior 
without breaking the maintenance part. I believe that the proposed 
changes 1. - 4. would provide such a change if 503 is used as today for 
maintenance (with Retry-After) and without Retry-After as described for 
proxies under overload.

I think this would be closer to a new SIP extension for overload 
control, which I think is useful, than to a correction of RFC3261, which 
is the scope of this draft.

I can see that it might be useful in some scenarios to provide these 
kind of hints to the client. But often a client is able to find backup 
servers even without such hints, e.g., through DNS. The client might 
also know of other server the overloaded server wasn't aware of. With a 
redirection list, a server would need to know all its peers that might 
possibly jump in if it is overloaded.

I think that being specific in a response about what went wrong (e.g. 
"I'm overloaded") is useful since it will help the client to react 
properly (e.g. not to resend the request).

I agree. However, as mentioned, this draft is not intending to propose a 
SIP extension for overload control.

This kind of input is highly appreciated! :)

Thanks,

I seem to have come detached from Cisco, so if you happen to have my  
old Cisco email address on file, please delete it. It doesn't route

My softarmor.com address (as used for this message) should continue

Hi,

I have taken a stab at writing a quick draft about both issues (I agree 
it makes sense to tackle them in a single document). Until it appears in 
the archives, you can fetch it from:

http://users.piuha.net/gonzalo/temp/draft-camarillo-sip-body-handling-00.txt

I have marked a few open issues so that we can continue discussions 
around those on the list (this is, of course, just an initial draft).

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Gonzalo,

Thank you for doing this. It is a great start. I largely agree with what 
you have written.

One specific comment about the draft:

- Open issue in section 3: perhaps a new Reason code, to be used
   with a 415 response would be adequate.

I think there are a number of loose ends, some mentioned, some not. In 
many cases, while I have an opinion what the right answer might be I 
think it needs discussion. Here is what I came up with:

- How to determine what processing a body part should receive

In many cases the processing of a body part is determined by: the 
content disposition, the content type, and perhaps the context within 
which the message is received. For instance, this is true for type sdp 
with disposition session in an INVITE; for type text/plain with 
disposition render in a MESSAGE; and for type kpml with disposition ??? 
in a SUBSCRIBE. In these cases there is no overt *reference* to the body 
part.

In other cases the processing is determined by the context of a 
reference to the body part via a cid: url that references the Content-ID 
of the body part. You mentioned this as well.

The case I am concerned with is when there is ambiguity between these. 
For instance 3261 defines Content-Dispositions "alert" and "icon". While 
these aren't described very well, it appears that if a body part is 
present with disposition "alert" then it should be used for alerting 
based on its presence, without any overt reference. But there is also an 
Alert-Info header, which *could* contain a cid: url. If there was an 
Alert-Info header with a cid: url that referenced a body part, must that 
body part be of disposition "alert"?

Its my feeling that the definition of each disposition should specify 
how use decisions should be made for body parts having this disposition. 
There should be one or more dispositions that state that their use is to 
be determined by how they are referenced. And headers that might 
reference body parts should define the acceptable dispositions for the 
body parts that are referenced.

If a message contains a body part with type and disposition that defines 
how it is processed without need of a reference, and there *also* is a 
reference to it, then it should be processed both ways. (This however 
should happen rarely or never.)

- What Content-Disposition type should multipart bodies have?

When you have a multipart body, it has a disposition, and each of its 
contained body parts also has a disposition. I have never seen any 
specification of what disposition the multipart itself should have. None 
of the examples I have seen have had a Content-Disposition header in the 
multipart. According to the sip defaulting rules, a multipart body 
without a C-D header has disposition "render", which seems a bit weird.

In the case of multipart/alternative, I think the disposition type of 
all the contained body parts should be identical. I think it would also 
make sense for the multipart/alternative itself to contain the same 
disposition. That would simplify processing, because the whole thing 
could be ignored if the disposition has a type that will be ignored.

In the case of multipart/mixed, the disposition types of the contained 
body parts will typically vary. The type of the mixed body simply needs 
to be something that causes it to be processed. Using the default of 
"render" seems weird to me. It would make sense to me to have some 
special C-D type for this purpose. Potentially it could be defined as 
the default C-D for multipart/mixed in the same way that "session" is 
the default for type application/sdp.

- Must the recipient of a message process all multipart bodies and their 
contents? Recursively?

Note that a multipart body can contain other multipart body parts, thus 
potentially forming a tree of body parts of arbitrary shape and depth.

So, the developer of a UA will want to know: do I have to parse all of that?

I think the answer is: like anything else, you make this decision based 
on the disposition type and handling. (If you understand multipart/mixed 
(and you should) then you also understand that multipart/X where you 
don't know X should be processed the same as multipart/mixed.)

If handling is optional and the disposition type and content type are 
known to you, then you must parse it. Each contained body part is then 
processed based on its own disposition. If the handling is optional and 
the disposition type or content type are not known to you then you can 
ignore it.

(This puts a premium on having an agreed to disposition type that is 
typically used for multipart/mixed and which everyone that supports 
multipart is expected to support.)

- What "handling" value should be used for multipart bodies and the 
contained body parts?

If a body part is referenced by a cid: url in a header (or in another 
body part I suppose), then the handling of the body part should be required.

Contained, non-multipart body parts that aren't referenced by cid: can 
have handling required or optional as appropriate for their use.

A multipart body should have handling of required if any of the parts it 
contains are required. Otherwise it may have optional handling.

Multipart/alternative is tricky. Only one alternative is to be used, and 
it is assumed that some alternatives may not be understood. So it seems 
that all except the first contained body part should have optional 
handling. The first may be required or optional depending on whether its 
ok to handle none. And the handling of the multipart/alternative 
container is as above.

- What about "gratuitous" nesting of multiparts?

It seems that it is technically valid to wrap a body part, such as an 
SDP offer, in one or many levels of multipart wrappers. A recipient who 
receives such a thing, and processes it according to what Gonzalo has 
specified and what I have suggested above, should be able to deal with this.

But its not a good thing.

So I think we ought to at least state that the sender of a request 
SHOULD NOT use a multipart wrapper when there is only one part, and 
SHOULD NOT nest one multipart/mixed within another unless there is a 
*reference* to the nested one. (Instead of nesting, include all the 
parts in the outer multipart.) And a sender SHOULD NOT nest one 
multipart/alternative within another.

	Thanks,
	Paul

On reflection, this is tricky.

If the header containing the reference is optional (as most are), then 
recipients that don't understand the header will have no need for the 
referenced part. If it were required and they don't support the type, 
then they would fail the request. This is bad.

So if processing of the header is optional, then the referenced body 
part should have optional handling.

But then there could be a problem if the recipient does understand and 
process the header, but doesn't understand the body part, and so because 
it is optional doesn't process it. In that case, the cid reference will 
be unsatisfied. This could also result in an inappropriate error.

I think the solution here is that if a header contains a cid url, and if 
that url cannot be resolved to a body part that is supported, then the 
UA should treat it the same as if the header itself was not understood - 
typically ignoring it unless there is a Require in effect that demands 
failing the request.

An alternative is to require that Content-ID be remembered even for 
parts that are not understood, so that references can be resolved even 
if they can't be processed. This would allow more precise errors to be 
generated. This wouldn't be so hard at an outer level, but it might be 
troublesome in conjunction with nesting.

This is great Gonzallo. Thanks for doing this.

Here are some comments:

- In section 4, another example that I think you should list for=20
  Multipart/Mixed is RFC 3204 which actually has examples of=20
  INVITEs with Multipart/Mixed (one for SDP, the other for=20
  QSIG/ISUP tunnelling). That spec also illustrates the content-
  disposition mechanism (i.e., "optional" for QSIG/ISUP).


- I like your text on Multipart/Alternative. I'd like to include the=20
  following snippet of text from draft-jennings-sipping-multipart-02.txt
  in there:

   It is critical that multipart/alternative offers follow the semantics
   of multipart/alternative, notably the following text from RFC2046
   [2]:

       "THE SEMANTICS OF CONTENT-ID IN MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE:  Each
        part of a "multipart/alternative" entity represents the same
        data, but the mappings between the two are not necessarily
        without information loss.  For example, information is lost
        when translating ODA to PostScript or plain text.  It is
        recommended that each part should have a different Content-ID
        value in the case where the information content of the two
        parts is not identical."

  I'd also like to see an example of Multipart/Alternative for the
  MESSAGE message (with text/plain and text/html for example).


- I believe that the following text in section 4 is not strong enough:

   If a UAS does not support multipart bodies and receives one, the UAS
   SHOULD return a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response.

  Instead, it should read as follows:

   If a UAS does not support multipart bodies and receives one, the UAS
   MUST return a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response, and it MUST=20
   return a list of acceptable formats as specificed in
[RFC3261]/21.4.13.

  I believe this is in line with RFC 3261/8.2.3. I will point out that=20
  we have found in the field that if a UAS does NOT send a 415 and just
  "ignores" the Multipart body altogether, what happens is that the
receiver of the
  INVITE interprets the INVITE as having NO initial Offer, and sends an
an
  Offer of it's own in the 200/18X. This is interpreted by the sender of
the
  INVITE as an Answer, resulting in all hell breaking loose.

Thanks for comments back.  See [PB] inline below.   I've snipped a bunch 
to keep the volume to a dull roar.

[PB] The change, as I see it, is that 503 would no longer be used to 
send a client elsewhere, or cause the client to think it should go, 
in fact would make the client think it should NOT go.  So, 500 would 
need to take on that meaning. 

[PB] The bits that triggered me thinking this way are:
ISSUE 3, sec 4, 
  "... Should all non-overload failures be changed to 500 (Server 
   Internal Error)?  It would, e.g., enable a proxy [or client] to 
   try alternate servers for all non-overload failure cases."
and sec 6.1
  "A client (proxy or UAC) receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD
   NOT attempt to forward the request to an alternate server. ..."

[PB] Current draft text is
  "... server is temporarily unable to process the request due to a
   temporary overloading ..."

[PB] But, for maintenance and similar cases, you may actually want the 
client to go elsewhere for service.  Text in the draft would prohibit 
this from happening, see sec 6.1
  "A client (proxy or UAC) receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD
   NOT attempt to forward the request to an alternate server. ..." 
Hence the proposal to make the desired redirect-like behaviour explicit 
somehow.

[PB] Could be, or maybe not -- not really my call.  Just a thought.  But 
if such a thing were to be done in overload work, it would effectively 
be undoing this draft, would it not?

[PB] Certainly agree, it would be advantageous to be able to inform the 
client "go find somewhere else", but also think in other circumstances 
(notably clustered servers) it would be advantageous to be explicit 
"go here".  I expect if we were to go for a new header (or similar), 
we could probably find some way to accommodate both meanings.

[PB] Certainly agree here too.  In fact, if we could find some way to 
provide just that hint in 503 (reason = overload vs maintenance, vs 
load sharing ... ), then we could distinguish the cases.  This would 
eliminate, or at least make less strong, the proposal for a new 5xx. 
Still think the redirect-like "go here" header would be good though.

[PB] One problem being, the changes in this draft do focus on overload, 
yet the more general overload work does not focus on any of the other 
scenarios.

I wasn't aware of that usage in RFC3204.  In both section 4.1 and its
example, though, I don't think it's using multipart/mixed correctly.  Here
is its example (section 4.1 is similar):

   To illustrate the use of the 'application/QSIG' media type, below is
   an INVITE message which has the originating SDP information and an
   encapsulated QSIG SETUP message.

   Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter
   (specified in RFC 2046 [4]) which in the example has the value
   "unique- boundary-1". This is part of the specification of MIME
   multipart and is not related to the 'application/QSIG' media type.

Per the semantics of multipart/mixed, both of those bodies are interpreted
by the recipient -- wouldn't that cause two calls to be set up?  Or does the
SDP describe the VoIP leg and the QSIG describes the PSTN leg?  If the
latter, I do feel multipart/related would have been a better choice.  

[[As MIME parsers are supposed to interpret unrecognized multipart/* as
multipart/mixed, a MIME-compliant parser that currently has the
RFC3204-described behavior <quote>should</quote> work correctly if it
received a multipart/related instead of multipart/mixed.]]

Yes, that section is very well written and captures exactly the problem with
multipart/alternative.

That's awful.  You could detect this situation by requiring the answerer to
insert a reference to the Content-ID they're answering; if an ACK comes back
without that Content-ID, you'll know you encountered such a defective
implementation.

Hi Dan,=20

To answer your question about the Multipart usage for ISUP/QSIG
tunnelling.

No, it does not set-up two calls. It sets-up ONE call.

The SDP is mandatory.

The QSIG or ISUP is optional. If supported it provides additional
information for the softswitches for legacy PSTN interop or other
features.
If not it should be safely ignored.

So 3204 operates exactly as it should. Works fine. Has been working fine
for years (except for implementations that have problems with Multipart
MIME,
which has forced the use of B2BUA that strip off these MIME bodies.)

For Multipart/Related (as described in RFC 2387), I
don't think it's applicable to 3204 as I think they would be=20
independent. My reading of 2387 is that they depend on each
other.

This is not the case for 3204. They are not dependent.

(And really, it's way too late to change 3204).

But, if I interpret your question in a broader sense, I guess,
the question is "Do we need to say anything about
multipart/related?". I would extend it to parallel and digest...
I guess we should. But I'm not sure what should be said.=20
If we don't have a use case for them, I'd rather we don't encourage
people to use it and create interop problems...

Yes, I expect RFC3204's syntax and semantics work fine between two
implementations that implement RFC3204.

My question if it the choice of multipart/mixed in RFC3204 was correct or if
multipart/related would have been more appropriate for RFC3204.  I have this
question because the QSIG (and ISUP) are directly related to the SDP, and
the QSIG/ISUP data provides additional information about that outgoing PSTN
call leg that assists it in being set up.

My underlying question is what guidance we want to provide for Gonzalo's
document.  If RFC3204's use of multipart/mixed is what we want to do in SIP
when there are bodyparts that have a relationship with each other, then
Gonzalo's document will need to discourage use of multipart/related.

In RFC3204, the QSIG or ISUP parts do not appear to have any meaning without
the SDP.  Or do they?  For example, is it meaningful for me to send an
INVITE that has only the QSIG part (and no SDP)?

> (And really, it's way too late to change 3204).

Even if consensus were to be formed that there was a mistake?  Obviously no
such consensus has been formed, but I would like to have the discussion.

If we do consider it acceptable to change RFC3261's requirements around MIME
multipart support, I suggest it is reasonable to analyze what we may have
done wrong elsewhere around MIME with SIP.

And external-body, and all the other parts.  Yes, that is my underlying
question in light of Gonzalo's document and Cullen's stated desire for the
SIP community to document multipart support.

Yeah, I think it would be worthwile to talk about it, but not in the
context
of 3204.

Frankly, what I think we should say is "RECOMMEND don't use unless some
IETF RFC defines a use for them".

I don't think that the draft implies this change in semantics for 500s 
(and it certainly wasn't the intention). Even today, a client can always 
go somewhere else after a 500 if it has discovered an alternate server.

I do think that there is an important point regarding the use for 
maintenance (see below).

The current draft covers overload only and does not address the 
maintenance aspect of 503. This is certainly something that needs to be 
addressed in the draft.

One of the troubles of the maintenance and overload uses is that they 
have different requirements. For maintenance, it makes sense for a 
client to resend the request, which it should not do under overload. For 
this reason, if 503 is used for both cases, a client need to be able to 
tell what it is supposed to do.

I wouldn't think so. I think getting the use of 503 under overload right 
is important and provides a basic/local way for a server to handle 
overload. It seems somewhat orthogonal to a SIP extension for overload 
control.

I fully agree - and maybe there IS a case for a new response code.

Generally, I think an overload control mechanism should focus on 
overload control and not try to cover as much as possible. But it 
certainly should not break anything that works today.

Gonzalo,

Concerning the handling parameter, there is no normative statement in
RFC 3261 mandating that this be supported, as far as I can see. The only
normative language seems to be "If the handling parameter is missing,
the value "required" SHOULD be assumed." There is no normative statement
concerning what to do if it is present. Therefore any UA that inserts
handling=optional should not rely on this being taken account of by the
peer UA.

[JRE]Moreover, QSIG or ISUP parts can be sent in other messages without
SDP, e.g., in an INFO request.

Things are a bit messed up wrt this header:

- 3261 section 20.11 says: "This SIP header field extends the MIME
   Content-Type (RFC 2183 [18])." But RFC 2183 is about
   Content-Disposition, so there is clearly a typo here.

- From reading that section you might think that 3261 invented the
   handling parameter. It isn't defined in 2183, but it is defined
   in 3204 which was published prior to 3261. That does have normative
   statements about how the parameter is to be processed. So 3261
   should have referenced that.

I don't know how we are going to dig ourselves out of this hole. I 
suppose the usual answer is a new option tag.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: F. Audet
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-sips-04.txt
	Pages		: 54
	Date		: 2007-5-24
	
This document provides clarifications and guidelines concerning the
   use of the SIPS URI scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   It also makes normative changes to SIP.  This document also provides
   a discussion of possible future steps in specification.

Hi,

In ETSI TS 102 027-2 V4.1.1 (2006-07), test case SIP_CC_PR_TR_SE_V_014, =
it
mentioned :

<Quote>
TPId:   SIP_CC_PR_TR_SE_V_014

Status: PICS: A.77/3.2

Ref:    RFC 3261 [1] sections 17.2.2 and 17.2.3.

Purpose: Ensure that the IUT in a server BYE Proceeding state, on =
receipt of
a BYE request, including a Via header set with a different branch =
parameter
without the magic cookie "z9hG4bK" but with the Request-URI, To tag, =
From
tag, Call-ID, CSeq and top Via header identical as in the first BYE =
request,
repeats its last response.
</Quote>

But as per Via header comparison rule defined in RFC3261 20.42 Via,=20

<Quote>
   Two Via header fields are equal if their sent-protocol and sent-by
   fields are equal, both have the same set of parameters, and the
   values of all parameters are equal.
</Quote>

So that one Via with different branch value, so second BYE with a =
different
branch parameter will never the transaction create by the first BYE, so =
it
shall not repeats its last response. so the test case is wrong.

Does I miss sth?

Thanks,
Lavis=20

Hi All,

I have some questions regarding 1xx responses that establishes dialog 
(with To tag) .

Q1:  Should I expect that these responses have a Contact header?
Q2:  If they do so, should the remote target of the dialog be refreshed 
by that Contact at the side that has received that 1xx response and 
should the remote target of the dialog be refreshed by the Contact in 
the INVITE request at the side that has received that INVITE?
Q3: If not, should the remote target of the dialog be refreshed by the 
Contact in the INVITE request
    at the side that has received that INVITE and has sent dialog 
establishing 1xx response?

Thanks in advance.
Best Regards
Nina.

Yes. If it doesn't then it hasn't provided enough information to 
establish the dialog.

Wel, the first response isn't really a "refresh" since until then you 
don't have one to refresh. I suppose if the address were to change 
before the completion of the INVITE transaction then it *could* be 
refreshed in subsequent 1xx responses. But unless you are using reliable 
provisionals that is problematic, since you don't know if the 
provisionals have been received. One would hope that this situation will 
not arise.

Regarding the UAS, I don't understand the question. It receives the 
initial INVITE, which contains the contact from the UAC. That is the 
only one it gets. In an initial INVITE there is no question of 
"refreshing". In the case of a reINVITE, the value is a "refresh", and 
it doesn't take effect (refresh) until and unless it successfully 
completes. (I believe there is some degree of controversy over this last 
point.)

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

All,
   After reading  RFC 3725 BCP for 3rd Party Call Control it created an
interesting question.

Is an SDP session-id tied directly to a SIP dialog and cannot change in 
the SIP dialog?
RFC 3725 seems to imply that but I cannot find any documentation that 
specifically
states this. (Because of the mapping of the o= line ).

Consider the following scenario when Early media is provided and the
call is forwarded to another location. At Answer an Empty Re-Invite is 
used perform
End to End SDP negotiation and the B2BUA proxies the SDP (without 
change) to
complete the Path minimization. This causes a change in the SDP session 
ID to the
originator also allowing for payload type numbers to be re-mapped. 
Without the
possibility of changing the SDP session-id there are cases, mainly in 
inter-vendor situations,
that cause collision of Dynamic Payload type numbers. Unfortunately 
trying to do all the
remapping of payload types in the bearer stream is not a viable option.

In addition to this scenario, there are scenarios (Blind Transfers for 
one) that a newly
added leg is originated with an Empty Initial Invite requiring the Far 
office to send an
initial offer and now how do you match up SDP media lines and payload types
numbers for these?

If changing the session-id is not the correct solution how do is this 
solved?
RFC 3264 states that payload type number MUST not change within a session
(i.e. SDP session) but it states that the Payload type number do not 
have to be
the same in both directions and  thanks to H248 this is the case.

If I extend what is not in RFC3264 to say that if the upper layer 
protocol provides
a new session-id within a SIP dialog then I can re map the Payload type 
numbers
and the SDP Session-id and new SDP version number are considered valid and
everything works.

What is the opinion of the BCP 3725 authors or those working with SIP RFCs?

Thanks
Dave Robinson

The sipping list would be more appropriate for this. I will post a reply 
there and suggest further discussion proceed there.

(I'm not including both lists in the same reply to avoid having all

how about write a quite Update to 3261 pointing to 3204 instead of 
2183. Then obsoleting this new Update with Gonzalo's ID (that clears 
the handling parameter up)...

just an (unusual) thought (to a non-straightforward problem)

   Purpose: Ensure that the IUT in a server BYE Proceeding state, on receipt of
   a BYE request, including a Via header set with a different branch parameter
   without the magic cookie "z9hG4bK" but with the Request-URI, To tag, From

Since "z9hG4bK" is not to be present, it may be testing RFC 2543
behavior.  Does this test make sense in that light?

Not sure the purpose is  the "Purpose" list in the test case or for 2543
test?

 But the [Ref] listed in the test case is reference to RFC3261.

And for RFC2543(not bis02 afterwards) server, it didn't check the Via for
the request matching transaction at all.

   Q1:  Should I expect that these responses have a Contact header?

As Paul says, if it didn't have a Contact header, it couldn't
establish a dialog.

   Q2:  If they do so, should the remote target of the dialog be refreshed 
   by that Contact at the side that has received that 1xx response and 
   should the remote target of the dialog be refreshed by the Contact in 
   the INVITE request at the side that has received that INVITE?

Responses are not "target refresh requests", so they don't change the
target address at their end of the dialog.  But of course, the
responses to the dialog-initiating request establish the initial
target address.

   Q3: If not, should the remote target of the dialog be refreshed by the 
   Contact in the INVITE request
       at the side that has received that INVITE and has sent dialog 
   establishing 1xx response?

RFC 3261 section 12.2:

   INVITE, the only target refresh request defined is re-INVITE (see
   Section 14).  Other extensions may define different target refresh
   requests for dialogs established in other ways.

Dale,

Not sure if I read your comment right, but RFC3261 12.2.1.2 says

When a UAC receives a 2xx response to a target refresh request, it
   MUST replace the dialog's remote target URI with the URI from the
   Contact header field in that response, if present.
It does not say anything about 1xx responses here though...Regards,Jeroen

what do you mean by a reason code? Do you mean a Warning code?... 
because Reason header fields are not allowed in responses.

I have added more structure to the draft (i.e., a few new sections) that 
I believe make it easier to read. You can fetch a working version from:

http://users.piuha.net/gonzalo/temp/draft-camarillo-sip-body-handling-01.txt

The points above are covered in Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 5. I have added a 
few guidelines to authors of future extensions so that folks writing 
specs are also aware of all these issues and take them into 
consideration when writing new extensions.

That's now covered in Section 4.1

That's OPEN ISSUE 3 now. We may indeed need to define a new disposition 
type.

I think that is now clear in the new version... but let me know if you 
do not think so.

That's now covered in Section 4.1

I have numbered the OPEN ISSUES. Now the draft contain 4 of them. I 
would like to discuss how to close them.

Hi Paul,

I have added a few guidelines about this in Section 5 of the new version 
of the draft:

http://users.piuha.net/gonzalo/temp/draft-camarillo-sip-body-handling-01.txt

With those guidelines and the behavior defined in other sections, we 
should be OK. Let me know if you agree or want to add further 
clarifications or behavior.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Hi Francois,

thanks for the comments. Answers inline:

I have added another reference to it in Section 3 as an additional 
example. You can fetch the new working version of the draft from:

I have not copy/pasted the text above, but I have included all of it 
rephrasing it.

When it comes to response generation, I always use SHOULD because a 
request may cause other error, apart from the ones we are defining here, 
and the UAS may need to return a different status code. That's why I do 
not use MUST in this case.

In any event, I have added more text stressing the importance of this.

Yes, this is really bad. I have added text stressing the importance of 
being able to produce error responses (Section 3.3).

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Hi,

Section 4.1 of the new revision below explains how to set the handling 
parameter:

http://users.piuha.net/gonzalo/temp/draft-camarillo-sip-body-handling-01.txt

We could add a sentence saying that UAs MUST support the handling 
parameter to the draft somewhere. Do we know of any implementation that 
implements MIME but does not implement this parameter? If there are no 
such implementations, we could be fine with just explicitly mandating 
its support from now on.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Never mind. I just wasn't thinking.

I believe you have covered my concerns.

I've been thinking if there are other similar issues regarding 
references to body parts. I think another is that it can be possible for 
a reference to be present in a body part. (For example if one body part 
is an application/sipfrag.) Potentially the reference could then be in 
an optional part that is not understood by the recipient. Again, we 
wouldn't want processing to depend on whether a reference was processed 
or not.

I'm not convinced there are any cases where this can be a real issue. It 
wouldn't be if the referenced body part were "within" the body part 
containing the reference. I think the sipfrag case would always fall 
into this category. I don't have any other examples in mind, so maybe 
this isn't really an issue. I'd just rather find any now rather than 
later. Can anybody else think of anything in this category? (Or do I 
have a monopoly on that job?)

Re Issues:

I don't know much about these. I quickly scanned 2387 and see that it 
has some special rules re processing Content-Disposition of the 
contained (related) parts. I *think* those are consistent with what we 
are doing.

Its my understanding that the distinction is based on which can be 
understood, relative to Content-Type. It isn't apparent to me that 
making this decision based on other attributes is valid. For one thing 
the parts are supposed to be ordered by increasing richness. If they 
differed by language this wouldn't be true.

So I think what you have is ok.

I think we need a new disposition type. I also think we should specify 
that this new one is the default for bodies of multipart/* content-type. 
That should fix up most examples and prior use, which afaict have not 
specified a content-disposition.

I'm inclined to say yes for completeness. But I don't expect to see any 
implementations using this the change their behavior at runtime.

Another thing in Section 3: You have used SHOULD in this section. I 
thought we wanted to change this to MUST. Did we?

There are also a couple of typos in Section 3:

s/extensions relay on them/extensions rely on them/

s/miltipart/multipart/

	That's it for now,

Hi,

Gonzalo's draft say that, when multipart/alternative is used, different
body parts can not have the same content type.

Below are a couple of use-cases where the same content type is used, and
which may still be feasible for alternative:

1.
=20
Let's assume I have two HTML bodies. They both contain the same=20
information, but one is "text friendly", while the other contains=20
pictures etc. Now, is that alternative or mixed(or parallel)?
=20

2.
=20
Let's assume I have the same information, but in different languages -=20
ie the Content-Language values are different. Is that alternative or=20
Mixed(or parallel)?
=20


Now, we may not have the expertise to determine whether alternative is
allowed or not in these cases. But, if the think there could be cases
where the same content type would be used for alternative, we need to
allow it.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

Gonzalo's draft describes a use-case where nested multipart bodies may
be used.

>From the implementation community we know that multipart is not widely
supported - which is the reason the draft was put together in the first
place.

And, when looking at the implementations that actually do support
multipart, I have one seen one or two that actually supports nested
bodies.


I wonder whether we should define an option-tag for the support of
nested bodies. Considering the limited support of non-nested multipart,
and the fact that it is still probably going to take a while before we
really needed nested multiparts (read: before we will have an
alternative to SDP), simply saying that entities MUST also support
nested multiparts may not have the real-life effect we wish (read:
people will not implement it no matter what the spec says), and we will
not get rid of the interop problems.=20

I think it's a big step forward if we manage to get people to implement
support of non-nested multipart bodies...

Comments?

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

The draft is basically ready for publication but I would like to see =
some clarifications in it.

1. The draft explains describes two mechanisms the session independent =
and the session dependent policies. I did not see what the relationship =
between them if any is. I think that at least the draft should say that =
they can be implemented independently if there are no other =
recommendations.

2. Section 3.2 describes how a UA discovers the policy servers for =
session independent policies based on the configuration framework =
ua-profile.=20

"ua-profile" event package [4] provides a mechanism to discover
   policy servers in the local network and the home domain.  The "local-
   network" profile-type enables a UA to discover a policy server in the
   local domain.  The "user" profile type enables the discovery of a
   policy server in the home domain.  A UA compliant to this
   specification SHOULD attempt to discover and subscribe to the policy
   servers in these two domains"

The configuration framework does not specify the profile data which is =
out of scope.
So what is the meaning of this section - is this one way to find the =
policy server or do you suggest that if you want to have session =
independent policies you should have the policy servers defined in the =
profile data but then how does a UA identify it in the profile data, is =
it by name?

I think this needs more clarification.

3. In section 4.2
" Endpoints set up a separate policy channel to each policy
   server and can specifically decide which information they want to
   disclose to which policy server"
How does this work with the trust model between the UA and the proxy. =
The UA claimed that it got the policy from the proxy but from this =
sentence you can assume that the UA got the policy only to what it =
asked. I think that the UA need to include in document sent to the proxy =
all the information it can map from SDP. =20

4. In section 4.4.2 what will be the proxy behavior if it sends the =
Invite with the policy server URI to an endpoint who do not support =
session policy. The EP can ignore the request and respond 200 that will =
not include the support for the session policy. What will the proxy do =
or is it left to local implementation.

5. In section 4.4.6 in the note

" If, however, a policy server cannot respond with
      a policy right away, it may return a policy that temporarily
      denies the session and update this policy as the actual policy
      decision becomes available"

I am not sure how does that work, what will the UA do in this case. Will =
it continue with the call without any media sessions?




Typo

In section 4.4.3 third line should be field and not filed=20

Hi,

One question is when "parallel" should be used instead of "mixed".

When mixed is used, the order of the bodies is significant, which is not
the case for parallel. And, for ISUP or QSIG, is there a difference in
which order the ISUP/QSIG and SDP bodies are presented?

I know that support of ISUP/QSIG bodies are implemented using mixed, and
I am not proposing to change that. But, I think the draft should maybe
talk a little more about the differences between parallel and mixed.

In most cases I guess it doesn't matter which one would use. At least I
can't think of any SIP use-case where the order of the bodies would be
significant.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I agree with Francois.

You can send the QSIG/ISUP without SDP, and as far as the information
itself is concerned, I don't think the QSIG/ISUP and SDP is related.

So, I don't think mixed is a misstake. One question (as I wrote in
anther mail) is whether parallel would also be feasible.

Regards,

Christer=20

Christer,

As best I understand, multipart/alternative assumes that you either do 
or don't "support" a particular alternative, and that the alternatives 
are arranged from least-preferred to most-preferred by the sender. The 
recipient is supposed to use the most-preferred (as defined by the 
sender) that it "supports".

I guess we could allow different attributes, besides content-type to be 
used to decide if a part is "supported", *if* we can come up with a well 
defined meaning for "supported".

I guess this could work for content-language. But I don't know about the 
text-friendly vs image-containing html. Maybe, but it needs better 
definition.

If we have a significant body of implementations that support un-nested 
multipart, but that don't support nested multipart, then maybe such a 
tag would be useful. But first we should probably try to understand the 
situation and choose the best migration approach.

But I would hesitate to give *new* implementations the option to only 
support un-nested. If you are doing a new implementation you should 
implement nesting from the beginning.

Hello Jari,
Thanks for your answers.
I'm try to do my best to understand how your I-D together with other
I-D's or RFC can be used to provide us with of methods to able to be use
in a number of scenarios. I do also think that we must let implementers
have a number of methods to select from in order to best solve found
issues. This is list of some scenarios I see.

1) The number of documents that a client want to monitor is huge. Number
of SIP sessions must be limited as it costs to refresh them over the
air.
=20
2) The documents to monitor belong to a number of users. The number of
SIP sessions must be limited as it cost to refresh them over the air. (
e.g. a user is a member of many groups and is allowed to see the content
of each group documents)

3) Fiber is used between a client and the network. Number of SIP
sessions or number of bytes sent is not an issue

4) It exist large documents. Changes are normally small ( e.g. a
resource list with 500 contacts and display name is changed or a contact
is added once a week)

5) The client has to need to be able to present the difference between
its cached version of a document and the latest document stored on the
server to the client user.

6) The monitored XML node is large. Changes are normally done only to
child element/attributes to the node ( e.g. a list element within a
resource-list document. A diplay name of one of the contact is changed).
Number of bytes sent between a server and a client is an issue.


Some more questions:
A) 1) is handle by your I-D as you can list a number of documents and
directories related to the R-URI. 2) is not handled. Do you think your
I-D can be combined with
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-subscribe-01 to be
able to use a exploder function in the network to have one Subscribe
sessions for all possible documents independent upon owner? As I see it
the parameter "path" is more or less replaced with the URI list in the
body therefore "path" needs to optional and not mandatory in this case?

B) As I see it a limited patch history function in the XCAP server can
be useful to handle 4) and 5). As you did not like my idea to send the
version information upstream via SIP, I have another idea and that is to
make it possible for a XCAP client to via the XCAP send do a Conditional
GET and if the etags are different receive a diff document instead of a
full document if such patch history exists. My view is that it is better
to keep a patch history on the server than keeping a copy of every
version. I also know that in OMA it exists requirement to be able to
provide a history of who and want certain clients added to the document
and this is more or less a patch history plus an indication about who
and when the patch was done. What's your view?

C)  6) needs that it is possible also to send xml patches also when you
subscribe for a XML node. My understanding of your I-D is that that is
not supported. Is that true?

it is useful to allow to suppress the notify, when you want to just send
some rpc-commands to the other end. And certainly it doesn't do what you
want, if it were to be used with content sync with several http
resources.

With http you can do instance manipulation (rfc3229). But it requires
versioning support on the XCAP server, which is overkill for the problem
at-hand, imo
(<http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg18920.html>). So
sure you could add an even more sophisticated stuff with sip here by
combining or listing locally already existing resources. So you could
optimize this but you would add yet more complexity and "interesting"=20
error cases... Also if you had every resource in sync you would
practically send the same information within subscribe body what you
will receive now within the initial notify (and of course, upstream
speed may be much slower than downstream).

   I wonder whether we should define an option-tag for the support of
   nested bodies.

I don't think there's a lot to be gained from defining such an
option-tag.  The sender should already be aware that there is a risk
the recipient can't understand nested bodies, and have arranged for
suitable fallbacks.  Conversely, the recipient should (at least) be
able to skip the nested multipart body part in the proper "I don't
understand this body part" way.  All an option-tag would do is allow
the sender to not add a fallback.

   Gonzalo's draft say that, when multipart/alternative is used, different
   body parts can not have the same content type.

   Below are a couple of use-cases where the same content type is used, and
   which may still be feasible for alternative:

You have a good point, though the use cases you've presented might be
dubious.  But I'd say that we don't want to *prescribe* that the
alternative parts must be different (based on any particular
attributes) in case some implementation decides to *depend* on that
rule, and we later discover a use case that makes the rule
disadvantageous.

A better statement is that repeated content-types are likely to be due
to an error in design on the sender's part, but they are allowed.

In that case we need some specific text saying that if the receiver does
not support nested multiparts it MUST do-this-and-do-that.

Because, as I said earlier, I don't think we will achieve what we want
by saying that one MUST be able to parse nested multiparts. It can be
rather tricky to implement (depending on how the parser is implemented,
though), and since there aren't really any use-cases out there yet I am
pretty sure some people will choose not to implement it (and saying that
people are not compliant in that case will not really help from an
interop perspective). So, because of that I think it would be good not
to mandate the support of nested multiparts, but to mandate appropriate
behavior if not supported - just like in any other case when a MIME body
contains an unsupported but required content type.

Regards,

Christer

More or less repeating what I said before:

I expect we do have to account in some way for implementations that have 
already been deployed, in absence of a clarifying document. Exactly how 
we deal with that is still TBD.

But as we define what is required to support this in the future, I think 
there is *no* benefit to defining two levels of support - full and 
partial. Anybody that sets out to provide support for this document 
should be expected to do it all - its not that much harder.

Personally, I think we should treat parallel just like mixed when
received.
And continue to use mixed for sending, at least for things that exist
already (like QSIG/ISUP).

I would be surprised if parallel was really used in the wild...

But I do agree we could say something about it.=20

I also think we should take into consideration what is already out
there, and not suddenly make all those implementations "wrong" just
because we are now adding lots of new MUSTs.

I am pretty sure that most implementations today supporting multipart
only support mixed, and non-nested bodies (maybe Robert has more correct
information based on his SIPit work).

So, when we think about nested bodies, non-mixed multiparts etc etc etc,
we really need to think whether it's a need for it in SIP in the first
place - at least without an option tag.

Because, again, making a huge document which mandates people to
implements lots of things, just because it can be done, will not help.
People will not implement it, unless they see any need for it.

Regards,

Christer

And, maybe forbid the usage of parallel with SIP, unless we really can
come up with a valid use-case where it is needed.

Hi Paul,

I have addressed your comments and include them in revision 01 before 
submitting it to the IETF. I will now go ahead submit it so that it 
appears in the official repository. Until then, you can fetch it from 
the same link as before (reload the page if you downloaded it before):

http://users.piuha.net/gonzalo/temp/draft-camarillo-sip-body-handling-01.txt

I wrote the text thinking of that possibility, but now I have rephrased 
it so that it is even more explicit about the fact that references can 
be found in body parts.

I have added the following text pointing to an example of such a case:

   "In another example, the extension for file transfer in SDP
    [I-D.ietf-mmusic-file-transfer-mech] places a Content-ID URL in a
    'file-icon' SDP attribute.  This Content-ID URL points to a body part
    whose disposition type is supposed to be 'icon'."

I have also added the following new open issue about the need to parse 
all body parts before being able to process any of them:

"4.2.  Body Processing

    UAs process message bodies and body parts in the following way.  On
    receiving a SIP message, if a body part is not referenced in any way
    (e.g., there are no header fields or other body parts with a
    Content-ID URL pointing to it), the UA processes the body part as
    indicated by its disposition type and the context in which the body
    part was received.

    OPEN ISSUE 4: this means that a UA would need to parse all body parts
    to find references between them before being able to fully process
    them.  If we are OK with this, we need to include text here
    explaining it."

I have added the following text to Section 5:

    "This specification recommends support for 'multipart/mixed' and
    'multipart/alternative'.  At present, there are no SIP extensions
    that use different 'multipart' subtypes such as parallel [RFC2046],
    digest [RFC2046], or related [RFC2387].  If such extensions were to
    be defined in the future, their authors would need to make sure
    (e.g., by using an option-tag or by other means) that entities
    receiving those 'multipart' subtypes were able to process them.  As
    stated earlier, UAs treat unknown 'multipart' subtypes as 'multipart/
    mixed'."

>>    OPEN ISSUE 2: we know that we do not want two SDPs in a 'multipart/

I double check with an email expert to make sure we get this right.

Christer brought this one up. What did you have in mind?

This is probably something email people did not face. I think it makes 
sense to define the new disposition type.

yes, I am leaning towards defining it as well.

You refer to the following statement, right?

   "In particular, UAs SHOULD support the 'multipart/mixed'
    and 'multipart/alternative' MIME types."

If people agree that this should be a MUST, I will be happy to change it.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Gonzalo,

This all sounds good. I haven't read the new version yet, but based on 
your description below I have no problems with this, except possibly one 
area in which I am uncertain and which I would like to discuss:

I think there is at least ambiguity about what it means to "process" a 
body part. If one body part has a reference to another body part, then 
some amount of processing is required to detect such a reference.

There seems to be an implication that two-pass (or more) processing, 
such as is typically done in compilers, is expected. But given the 
variety of body types I think it will be difficult to define what may be 
processed in a first pass and what must be postponed to a second pass. 
Also, often people will want to use off-the-shelf packages to support 
certain body types, and those may not be so cooperative with this 
requirement.

Also, whether we like it or not, there will be systems that are only 
interested in a subset of what is there. (For instance proxies that are 
interested in SDP for purpose of enabling access.) These will want to 
parse the minimum necessary to find what they are interested in. It 
would be best if we can figure out a way for this to work.

Maybe it is that a UA needs to parse everything that is supported, but 
other nodes it passes through can be more selective.

Nothing. I just don't know.

>Christer brought this one up. What did you have in mind?

I think it's worth adding a few words describing the behavior when
receiving en encrypted body part which the receiver is not able to
de-encrypt.

I guess the behavior would be the same as when receiving an unsupported
content type, so it would mostly be a clarification.

Regards,

Christer

I think the text is good.

But, I wonder whether we should alternative to the list of "different
multipart subtypes". At present there are no SIP extensions using
alternative either, so...
=20
Or, at least we could leave support of alternative open for the moment,
until we get more information about how it's supposed to be used in the
first place (regarding identical content type values etc).

Again, I think we should wait a little regarding alternative.

Hi Christer,

we should be ready for a transition to a new session description 
protocol, which includes experimental networks using their own stuff, 
and people seem to agree that alternative is the way to go. That is why 
it would be great if we could mandate its support already now.

The more we wait, the more trouble we could have in the future to use it.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi,

what I am hearing is that there are implementations out there that 
support multipart but not nested. Therefore, we need to decide two things:

1) do we want to have a MUST for multipart and a SHOULD for nested? I 
would say that we should have the same level (e.g., MUST, if we decided 
that MUST is appropriate) for both.

2) do we need a way for implementations that support multipart but not 
nested to be quickly updated to, at least, report that fact with an 
error response? This may make sense.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hello,
 Section 10.2 of RFC 3261 indicates the following,
"UAs MUST NOT send a new registration (that is, containing new Contact

header field values, as opposed to a retransmission) until they have

received a final response from the registrar for the previous one or

the previous REGISTER request has timed out."

In Section 10.3, "REGISTER requests MUST

be processed by a registrar in the order that they are received.

REGISTER requests MUST also be processed atomically, meaning that a

particular REGISTER request is either processed completely or not at

all. Each REGISTER message MUST be processed independently of any

other registration or binding changes."

In this scenario can the UA (which is operating on UDP transport) send a
de-register request (to remove the binding) with the same call-id and
Contact header but a incremented c-seq number, while a response for the
"refresh" registration is still pending ?

Yes.

But, at the same time we need to try to be backward compatible, and take
into consideration existing implementations which may support mixed but
not alternative. If those implementations reject alternative I think our
spec should not make them "not compliant". The same thing goes for
nested bodies.

The more we can "fit" the spec into what is already out there, the
better.

So, I don't mind to strongly recommend people to implement alternative,
and give examples why it may be useful in the future, but at the same
time I think we should also say that if the receiver does not support
alternative a error response MUST be sent - in order to avoid cases e.g.
described by Francois, where the receiver simply discard the multipart
and continues the call setup.

Regards,

Christer

I think if we don't do this, we will simply be creating another problem 
such as the problem we have today with multipart.

This only makes sense if there is something that the sender can do about 
it. For instance today a 415 that indicates support for SDP but not for 
multipart tells a sender that used multipart with SDP and some optional 
parts to try again with just the SDP.

So the question is: is there anything that the sender could do in this 
case. We already have a SHOULD strength requirement to not do gratuitous 
nesting. If that had been followed then the nesting must not be 
gratuitous, so what is the fallback strategy.

Also, I think if we do a survey we are likely to find more restrictive 
limitations than just no nesting. For instance multipart may only work 
with certain contained body parts. I suspect it is a fools errand to 
attempt to describe the particular restrictions of a non-compliant 
implementation in the hopes that the sender will be able to craft an 
alternative form of request that is useful.

For inadequate implementations I think we must focus on the installed 
base that must be coped with. In that regard, specifying something that 
the existing implementation must do, that it doesn't already do, makes 
little sense.

Hi,

My main concern is not what wording (SHALL, MUST, etc) we use.

The issue is that I think we need text saying what implementations that
DO NOT support alternative and/or nested shall do. If we say that they
shall reject the message I believe that many of the existing
implementations will be compliant with the spec.

And, if we give the possibility to simply reject the message, I believe
it will be easier to get people to change their implementations, if they
currently simply discard alternative and/or nested today.

Regards,

Christer

I guess there are people who know this better than me, but I do believe
there are implementations which do reject nested bodies today.

I agree that we can't do anything regarding implementations which simply
discard anything they don't understand.

The MIME spec already says that if you don't understand multipart/X then 
you should treat it as if it were multipart/mixed. So at a minimum we 
should expect implementations to do that much with alternative.

If we are going to make more accommodation than that based on what is in 
the wild then I suggest we should take a survey first to find out what 
we really need to cope with. We should be able to get some good data 
from SipIT. Maybe we should be trying to come up with a list of specific 
questions, or maybe we can have an essay question on the survey to get a 
description of exactly what is/isn't supported.

I think we will have a pretty good chance of seeing support in the 
future if we can tell implementors what they must do. I did 
specifications for multipart support in a stack a few years ago (which 
is when I discovered all these open issues), and I had to make up what 
was done based on speculation about what would be used. Even hard things 
can be straightforward to implement if the requirements are clear.

I agree that simply ignoring a body can cause huge problems.

I believe we have addressed that by clarifying the use of 
Content-Disposition and its handling parameter. In the absence of 
handling=optional, the request must be rejected. This part must be of 
MUST strength. And the default of handling=required in the absence of a 
C-D header must also be of MUST strength.

But there is little we can do about existing implementations that don't 
do that right. I guess I can see writing up somewhere that even if you 
aren't going to make your implementation compliant to this full draft 
you should at least do make sure you support Content-Disposition. Would 
it be helpful in that regard to make that part a separate draft???

Multipart/alternative is the best we have, though.  And who is to say that
image/jpeg is richer than image/gif, or that english is richer than latin?  

Anyway, the following RFCs standardize the use of Content-Language and refer
to using multipart/alternative when providing support for multiple
languages:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP SAML Profile and Binding
	Author(s)	: H. Tschofenig, et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt
	Pages		: 46
	Date		: 2007-5-29
	
This document specifies a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) profile
   of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) as well as a SAML SIP
   binding.  The defined SIP SAML Profile composes with the mechanisms
   defined in the SIP Identity specification and satisfy requirements
   presented in "Trait-based Authorization Requirements for the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)".

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message. 
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then 
"get draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-02.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Once we get down to a decision of supporting nested versus not
supporting nesting, presumably we are then entirely in the realm of the
multipart coding itself.

Could I ask someone to elaborate on what generic requirements already
exist within multipart/mime in this respect, before we start looking at
defining SIP specific rules or indications?

Chapter 5.1.4 in RFC2046 says (and I think that describes my use-case):

"Multipart/alternative" may be used, for example, to send a message
   in a fancy text format in such a way that it can easily be displayed
   anywhere:

     From: Nathaniel Borenstein <nsb@bellcore.com>
     To: Ned Freed <ned@innosoft.com>
     Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 09:41:09 -0800 (PST)
     Subject: Formatted text mail
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=3Dboundary42

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3Dus-ascii

       ... plain text version of message goes here ...

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: text/enriched

       ... RFC 1896 text/enriched version of same message
           goes here ...

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: application/x-whatever

       ... fanciest version of same message goes here ...

     --boundary42--

   In this example, users whose mail systems understood the
   "application/x-whatever" format would see only the fancy version,
   while other users would see only the enriched or plain text version,
   depending on the capabilities of their system."

Regards,

Christer

I am very sure that I have seen text related to the support of nested
multiparts, and what nodes are expected to support, somewhere, but I yet
have not found it.

I'm somewhat lost here. So you could request similar (or all) xcap docs 
on many different servers ? The "path" parameter is used as a 
deterministic way to describe the content what the client is interested 
in, so how with exploder you would select them ? I'd assume you would 
send the same parameter forward.

Yes, this is what instance manipulation is about, i.e. rfc 3229. What 
you would need is a new mime-type for xml-diff based on patch-ops. 
Secondly, you would require versioning in xcap server and lastly, 
retrieval of versioned documents to cleanly solve this initial sync 
problem. And still, ;-) we could add yet many other interesting 
features, and I'm in general in favor of improving things, but scope of 
this i-d is imo right, i.e. all of these can (and should)  be done in 
other  documents.

Right, I was initially hesitant about the requirement of xcap-component 
retrievals with sip. Although patching of xcap components (i.e. 
elements) is doable with some "magic" (it's not extremely complex), I'm 
inclined to think it's not a feature that you really need. So my 
preference is to keep this as simple as possible.
thanks,
jari

Hi,

I don't think we should try to specify in detail when one is allowed to
use alternative, and one is not allowed, but instead refer to other
specifications for specific content types, and say that an
implementation shall reject the message if alternative is used in a
wrong way (based on those other specs).

I think our main focus should be to describe the expected protocol level
behavior of a SIP entity when receiving alternative.

Do we have the same issue with mixed, btw? I assume there COULD be cases
where the same content type can be used with mixed?

Regards,

Christer=20

Well, assuming we don't think THAT could cause problems in the future...

But, since that is generic specific MIME behavior I think we'll have to
live with it.

But, I STILL think it's good to give an implementation to option to
reject alternative - at least if we find out that is what existing
implementations are doing.

My understanding is based on my SIPit experience, and what I have
implemented myself.

But, I have to admit I haven't been to SIPit for a while, so someone
else (Robert?) may have better information.

It's not always the implementors we have to tell - often it's the people
paying the implementors :)

I am not saying that it is difficult to implement alternative, but I
doubt many have done it.

But, it would be interesting to know what implementations do:=20

1. do they treat alternative as mixed?=20
2. do they reject the request?
3. do they support alternative?=20
4. do they discard the message body?

I think our spec should allow options 1, 2 and 3.

Regards,

Christer

I agree with that.

But, if there are implementations that don't even look at the C-D
headers, because they discard the whole message body because they don't
support multipart/alternative, that does not solve the problem. So, it
is important that implementations either treat alternative as mixed or,
as I suggest, reject the request.=20

BTW, in the case of alternative, is the receiver required to support all
body types if they have handling=3Drequired? Or, is it enough if they
support at least one of the alternative body types?

I absolutely agree that implementations MUST support C-D (including the
default value if C-D is not present).

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

At least in RELIABLE provisinal responses Contact is required, in order
to be able to send PRACK.

One of the issues we've been discussing before is whether an UAC is
allowed to send a non-CANCEL mid-dialog request once it has received an
UNRELIABLE provisional response. I think the conclusion has been that it
IS allowed, and in that case a Contact of course would be needed.

Whether we want to mandate Contact in unreliable provisional responses
or not is one issue, but as part of the new fix-the-bugs-in-3261 work
item it would give us an opportunity to clarify the issue.

Another, related, question which comes up every now and then: IF I
receive a provisonal response with a Contact, is it allowed to "update"
that Contact in the 200 OK (or, another reliable resonse)? Whatever the
answer is, I think some clarification text would be useful.=20

Regards,

Christer

Well, at the moment, what I am trying to do is get some understanding of
what we should scope as valid SIP work.

We need to be able to understand why something that is clearly a generic
problem for specification of nested MIME bodies merits a SIP specific
solution.

So:

-	is a generic solution already documented elsewhere?

-	if a generic solution is not documented elsewhere, should one be
documented, rather than a specific SIP solution?

Regards

Keith

Hi,

what Keith says makes sense. I believe mandating support for multipart 
in SIP is a SIP-specific problem. Mandating suppport for 
multipart/alternative is also a SIP-specific problem, since a 
SIP-specific problem such as the transition to new session description 
formats depends on that.

However, specifying if an implementation that supports multipart should 
support nested body parts or not is something more general on which the 
email folks have a lot of experience.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi Dan,

thanks for the pointers. It seems that we want to specify that, for 
multipart/alternative bodies whose content disposition is "session" (or 
early session), the content-types of all body parts MUST be different.

However, multipart/alternative bodies with a different disposition type 
should follow the general MIME rules.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi,

I think we should also mention 'partial' in the spec. I would propose
that we group it with the types (parallel, digest, etc) that would
require an option-tag.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

One thing I think we should study a little more is the usage of
'external-body'.

It can be used to indicate references to bodies located elsewhere then
in the SIP message itself, so maybe there could be some potential usage
for it.=20

We also have SIP headers (e.g. Alert-Info) which can be used for similar
things, so...

If we don't want to allow it, it would be good to also explicitly add it
to the list of body types which would require an option-tag.

Regards,

Christer

Hi Christer,

external body is not a multipart subtype. It it a message subtype. This 
draft deals with multipart subtypes.

Correct. Sorry for that.

I guess the same applies to my other mail regarding the partial subtype.

The question is whether we also need to say something about message
subtypes, but if we think it should be done in another document I won't
argue against that.

Hi,

Chapter 3.2 of Gonzalo's draft says:

"UAs should avoid unnecessarily nesting body parts. Therefore, UAs
SHOULD NOT use a 'multipart' body when there is only one body part."

However, chapter 5.1.1 of RFC2046 says:

"NOTE: Experience has shown that a "multipart" media type with a
single body part is useful for sending non-text media types."

So, I think we need to add some words saying that it can be useful in
some cases.

For example, I THINK I have seen INFO requests with encapsulated ISUP
messages inside a MIME body, eventhough the message doesn't contain any
other body types.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

When I was looking at RFC3204 I found the following text in chapter 3
(note the 2 last sentences):

"ISUP and QSIG messages are composed of arbitrary binary data that is
transparent to SIP processing. The best way to encode these is to use
binary encoding. This is in conformance with the restrictions imposed on
the use of binary data for MIME (RFC 2045 [3]). It should be noted that
the rules mentioned in the RFC 2045 apply to Internet mail messages and
not to SIP messages. Binary has been preferred over Base64 encoding
because the latter would only result in adding bulk to the encoded
messages and possibly be more costly in terms of processing power."

Now, if this text is not specific to ISUP and QSIG, but to binary data
in general, I think it needs to be documented in Gonzalo's draft.
Because, it seems to be one example of where we "override" the generic
MIME rules (I haven't check, but the text says that some rules in
RFC2045 does not apply to SIP...).=20

Regards,

Christer

Well, we probably should document it.  But SIP is not an exception,
*e-mail* is, as far as I can tell from scanning through 2045:

   Mail transport for unencoded 8bit data is defined in RFC 1652.  As of
   the initial publication of this document, there are no standardized
   Internet mail transports for which it is legitimate to include
   unencoded binary data in mail bodies.  Thus there are no
   circumstances in which the "binary" Content-Transfer-Encoding is
   actually valid in Internet mail.  However, in the event that binary
   mail transport becomes a reality in Internet mail, or when MIME is
   used in conjunction with any other binary-capable mail transport
   mechanism, binary bodies must be labelled as such using this
   mechanism.

Yes, I concur.

You also brought up an interesting point with language.  One Might Consider
it reasonable to have multipart/alternative, with several application/sdp
parts which differ in language (and probably different m/c lines).  Your
document should probably provide a pointer to SDP's a=lang and guidance
towards its use in conjunction with SDP Capability Negotiation.  Sortof a
'you might be tempted to use MIME constructs where SDP should be used
instead'.  That is, if there is agreement that a=lang and SDP Capability
Negotiation is the right way to select language.

(I'm thinking of situations where, for example, you want to send an offer
for an English, German, or French announcement ("The dam broke, please
evacuate to higher ground") or an IVR or a human telephone operator).

message/rfc822 [RFC2046], which is used when you forward a message,
routinely has nested multiparts when the message you're forwarding itself
had multiple parts.  It looks something like this:

  From: dwing@cisco.com

  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=A
  
  --A
  Content-Type: text/plain
 
  here is that email I mentioned during lunch.

The only reason I could see it being useful for email was when you're
sending the message to a non-MIME-aware mail user agent, and you
included a MIME prologue:

  From: dwing@cisco.com
  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=A

  You are reading this message with a mailer that doesn't understand
  MIME.  To review the attached content, use 'metamail'.

  --A
  Content-Type: image/jpg
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

Unless there is another case that it's useful for SIP, I think it could
only harm interoperability.

Dan,

If I follow what you are saying then I disagree with the use case.

I believe the Content-Language specifies the language of the text in the 
body part, not the language that might be conveyed in a media stream 
that is negotiated by the SDP in the body part.

Hi all,

I have read rfc2976 - The SIP INFO Method, but I haven't really 
understood that INFO message belongs only to INVITE dialog usage, which 
however draft-ietf-sipping-dialogusage-04 claims in its part 5.3:


      5.3. Matching requests to usages



   For many mid-dialog requests, identifying the usage they belong to is
   obvious.  A dialog can have at most one invite usage, so any INVITE,
   UPDATE, PRACK, ACK, CANCEL, BYE, or INFO requests belong to it.

So my, question is:
    Can INFO message  belong to other usages, besides INVITE, such are  
SUBSCRIBE  or REFER?

Thanks in advance,
Nina.

Like I said, it may be used for transporting ISUP information. Maybe
Francois has more information?

Also, if a client is going to support multipart anyway, I don't see how
it would harm interoperability. I would be very surprised if a client
supports MIME with multiple bodies, but not with a single body...

Christer

IMO a Contact is required in all provisional responses except for 100. 
3261 definitely has the notion of early dialog which is established by 
receipt of non-100 provisional response. (This would be an unreliable 
provisional based on 3261, possibly reliable based on extensions.)

The early dialog of course cannot be established without a Contact. So 
either the establishment of the early dialog is conditional on whether 
the provisional has the Contact or not, or else the provisionals must 
always have the contact. I don't recall any mention of this being 
conditional, so I think the contact is always required.

I was the one who originally raised this issue. I don't have a strong 
opinion on which way it should go, but I think what Gonzalo wrote 
(SHOULD NOT) is about right. The issue is that if there can be one level 
of gratuitous nesting, then what about two, or a hundred levels of 
gratuitous nesting?

I'm inclined to think that people SHOULDN'T do it, but that a recipient 
should deal with it, at least within reason. (Perhaps its ok not to 
support 100 levels of nesting.)

My understanding is consistent with what dialogusage says - INFO is 
specific to the INVITE dialog usage. But off the top of my head I can't 
recall where that is specified.

Typically an INFO method would be part of an INVITE usage. As far as I
know the Event header is not defined for INFO. I wouldn't count on the
other end to associate the INFO request to the subscription even if you
were to include the Event header.
Basically there is no need to have INFO on a subscription usage because
all information could be passed via SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY. Furthermore, I
have rarely seen INFO used in practice, usually used just to pass some
proprietary information.

Subject: [Sip] INFO message belongs only to INVITE dialog usage?

Hi all,

I have read rfc2976 - The SIP INFO Method, but I haven't really=20
understood that INFO message belongs only to INVITE dialog usage, which=20
however draft-ietf-sipping-dialogusage-04 claims in its part 5.3:


      5.3. Matching requests to usages



   For many mid-dialog requests, identifying the usage they belong to is
   obvious.  A dialog can have at most one invite usage, so any INVITE,
   UPDATE, PRACK, ACK, CANCEL, BYE, or INFO requests belong to it.

So my, question is:
    Can INFO message  belong to other usages, besides INVITE, such are =20
SUBSCRIBE  or REFER?

Thanks in advance,
Nina.

A new version of the SIPS draft has been posted:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sips-04.txt

The author thinks this is ready for last call. I think that, given  
the below discussion, it probably is too. But there is one issue I'm  
worried about.

We know it doesn't fix everything, we're not sure it is possible to  
fix everything with SIPS, but we are committed to fixing what we can.  
So please don't bother to say it isn't worth the effort since it  
doesn't make SIPS perfect -- you might be right, but that alone is  
insufficient reason to block things. One step at a time. I'm sure  
we'll be taking further steps in this space.

Now, for te issue I'm worried about:

I have received some personal feedback from more than one credible  
source that the draft's direction on transport=tls is inconsistent  
with the real world and possibly not optimal. But so far, Juha has  
been the only one I've noticed trying to explain this issue "on the  
record", and one voice does not overbalance a quiet consensus. So I'd  
like to ask the rest of you (if any) who actually feel this way to  
step up to the plate and explain what you're talking about, because I  
don't get it and it looks like a bunch of the WG doesn't get it.  
Please! If you don't step up now, I'm probably going to make rude  
"raspberry" noises if you bring it up someplace like Chicago.

There was IIRC no intent in the writing of RFC 2976 to restrict INFO  
to occurring within an INVITE dialog usage. So it could technically  
be used outside of one, including in non-dialog cases.

However, RFC 2976 is considered to be somewhat underspecified, and so  
far the only place we've further specified its usage is in the  
context of transporting binary data for telephony protocol tunelling.  
We have a standing consensus to NOT use it for arbitrary data at this  
time. If we were to start using it, we'd need to do something like  
the event-packages model for INFO. So don't use it, and you won't  
have to deal with this . . .

Implementations may well be doing multipart/mixed and including only
one bodypart.  I completely agree that might be happening.

By doing that, you are teasing fate, and you aren't "being conservative
in what you send".  Afterall, it's the receiver (not the sender) of the
MIME that may have difficulties.  

> I would be very surprised if a client
> supports MIME with multiple bodies, but not with a single body...

Yep, but it isn't the client that I'm so worried about.  I expect
if you sent a multipart containing one part (application/sdp), you
would find disasterous interoperability.

I agree with Dan.

I don't understand the use case in SIP of sending a Multipart with only
one body.

The mail example makes sense for really dumb implementations that don't
support
MIME whatsoever, but for SIP, there is no such thing since MIME has been
in SIP since
day one.

Hi All,

We require some clarity on ACK processing on the UA server side.=20

Consider the following scenario :=20

A -- INVITE ----> B
A <-- 200 OK ---- B
A -- ACK -------> B

A, B are SIP UAs.=20

In the above example, the SIP server A sent the ACK with same branch ID
as that of INVITE. We know clearly A is in error. However we are not
clear on what should be the behavior of B. Should the transaction layer
of B absorb this ACK or send it to TU ?=20

Please help.

Regards,
Kannan

Hi,=20

>I agree with Dan.
>=20
>I don't understand the use case in SIP of sending a Multipart=20
>with only one body.

Again, I think I've seen INFOs and/or BYEs carrying ISUP informatio in
multipart, without any other body (unfortunately I have to use the word
"think", because I don't have any real examples in front of me :)

But, I have nothing against saying that one SHOULD NOT (or even MUST
NOT) SEND it. But, I do think one should be prepared to RECEIVE such
messages, in order to be backward compatible with existing
implementations which may not be fully compliant the draft.

And, regarding Dan's example: if a client is not able to handle
multipart carrying only SDP, I don't think it will be able to handle a
multipart carrying SDP and something else either - and we will have the
problem Francois presented earlier (the multipart, and the SDP innit, is
thrown away).

Regards,

Christer

Yep.  But that's exactly why I don't think we should encourage
unnecessary use of MIME -- it only tempts fate.

In the "Summary of header fields" table of RFC3261 Contact is indicated
as "o" for 1xx responses. Whether that is because 1xx also covers 100
Trying, or because of some other reason, is unclear.

So, whatever option - mandating Contact in non-100, or allowing non-100
without Contact (which I assume means the early dialog will not be
established) - we choose, I think it needs clarification.

Maybe the easiest thing would be to say something like: "If the
provisional response is intented to establish an early dialog, it MUST
contain a Contact header."

Also, as I mentioned earlier, I think we need to clarify whether it's
allowed or not to "update" a previously sent Contact in a new 1xx or
2xx.

<---- 180 Contact=3DB
<---- 183 Contact=3DC
<---- 200 Contact=3DD

(the To tag has the same value in all 3 messages)

Regards,

Christer

Chapter 2 of 2976 says:

"The INFO method is used for communicating mid-session signaling
information along the signaling path for the call."

I think "mid-session" rules out the non-dialog cases, doesn't it?


On the other hand, chapter 4 says:

"There is potential that INFO messages could be forked by a SIP Proxy
Server."

That should not happen in a mid-dialo case, should it?

Eventhough not specified, in real life it IS used for sending DTMFs
(which is also listed in 2976 as an example usage, eventhough we may
have standing consensus on something else) and "non-telephony protocol"
information. I would even use the word "de facto standard" in some
cases. However, I am not aware of any non-INVITE dialog usage.

Christer

The Invite Server transaction is completed as soon as the server on B =

separate transaction and in this case should be forwarded to TU by the =
transaction layer.=20

Now if your question is whether the TU should honor this ACK and stop =
re-transmitting 200 response, RFC 3261 is not clear about this. based on =
your implementation the TU may choose to ignore this ACK with incorrect =

Hi All,

We require some clarity on ACK processing on the UA server side.=20

Consider the following scenario :=20

A -- INVITE ----> B
A <-- 200 OK ---- B
A -- ACK -------> B

A, B are SIP UAs.=20

In the above example, the SIP server A sent the ACK with same branch ID
as that of INVITE. We know clearly A is in error. However we are not
clear on what should be the behavior of B. Should the transaction layer
of B absorb this ACK or send it to TU ?=20

Please help.

Kannan

Hi,

I don't object to your example, but wasn't message outside the scope of
the document (it only deals with multipart)? So, a "valid" example would
be a multipart containing another multipart.

In any case, the text I was thinking about was not an example, but more
generic text on what support is expected regarding nested body types.

Regards,

Christer=20

True.  But that occurs when you forward a message containing
two parts itself.

I'm thinking MUST be supported; otherwise, we'll be back here in another 5
years trying to noodle over adding nested multipart support because we tried
to over-simplify things in 2007.
