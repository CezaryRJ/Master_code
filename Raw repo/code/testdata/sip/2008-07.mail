sounds like we're deprecating functions

doesn't do roles/saml justice

roles/saml isn't about global names, it's about asserted 
categorization of identities

this one gets my vote, since it clearly discusses most of what this 
WG is being proposed to charter work for (roles and identity)

this is a possibility

I don't mind this

Before going to deep on charter names and all, I think it'd be good to 
discuss whether it makes sense to have a WG do this work.

The first deliverable is a revision of 4474. There are differing 
opinions on the table about whats included in that revision. If all 
we're going to do is update it so that its clearer that it really 
doesn't work with numbers, we don't need a WG to do that. If we're going 
to 'fix' it to work with numbers - I'd prefer to start with a plausible 
proposal, and frankly I don't think there is one (an enum-based solution 
is pure science fiction...).

We're also pretty far from consensus so far on how/if the SBC problems 
can be fixed. Along the same lines, I think we need some agreement that 
this is a fixable problem, before chartering a group.

Guidelines for usage of e164 numbers for identifiers - well that is a 
REAL problem and a constant source of interop issues (tel vs. sip? + or 
not-+?). Worth addressing I think.

Unanticipated respondent problem - we haven't solved this problem yet, 
and frankly I'm not convinced we really need to. Given the size of the 
gulf between real usage of SIP security and identity mechanisms, and the 
specs we've produced, I am reluctant to start new work here without 
clear expectation that folks are lining up to actually USE it.

So, net/net is that I am unconvinced there is enough content here to 
propose a new WG.

It works with numbers (numeric identities) at a domain now. It can be  
made to work with numbers from a gateway, IF there's some way to  
convey the limitation of the identity server's knowledge about the  
source of the number (and we have proposals for that). We had a rather  
long thread on the topic that seemed to indicate acceptable solutions  
for that whole problem space. I know, not everybody read it. And since  
SIP isn't entertaining the work, nobody is going to write a draft on  
it for us.

Did you read the existing solution drafts from Dan and Kai? They  
seemed workable, and fairly easy to reconcile.

As promised, here's my proposed text:

   Because DTLS-SRTP uses RFC 4474 to bind the media keying material to
   the SIP signalling, the assurances about the provenance and security
   of the media are only as good as those for the signalling.  There are
   two important cases to note here:

   o  RFC 4474 assumes that the proxy with the certificate "example.com"
      controls the namespace "example.com".  Therefore the RFC 4474
      authentication service which is authoritative for a given
      namespace can control which user is assigned each name.  Thus, the
      authentication service can take an address formerly assigned to
      Alice and transfer it to Bob. This is an intentional design
      feature of RFC 4474 and a direct consequence of the SIP namespace
      architecture.
   o  When phone number URIs (e.g.,
      'sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com') are used, there is no
      structural reason to trust that the domain name is authoritative
      for a given phone number, although individual proxies and UAs may
      have private arrangements that allow them to trust other domains.
      This is a structural issue in that PSTN elements are trusted to
      assert their phone number correctly and that there is no real
      concept of a given entity being authoritative for some number
      space.

   In both of these cases, the assurances of DTLS-SRTP provides in
   terms of data origin integrity and confidentiality are necessarily
   no better than SIP provides for signalling integrity when RFC 4474
   is used. Implementors should therefore take care not to indicate
   misleading peer identity information in the user interface.
   e.g. If the peer's identity is
   sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com, it is not sufficient to
   display that the identity of the peer is +17005551008. In cases
   where the UA can determine that the peer identity is clearly an
   E.164 number, it may be less confusing to simply identify the call
   as encrypted but to an unknown peer.

   In addition, some middleboxes (B2BUAs and Session Border
   Controllers) are known to modify portions of the SIP message which
   are included in the RFC 4474 signature computation, thus breaking
   the signature.  This sort of man-in-the-middle operation is
   precisely the sort of message modification that 4474 is intended to
   detect.  In cases where the middlebox is itself permitted to
   generate valid RFC 4474 signatures (e.g., it is within the same
   administrative domain as the RFC 4474 authentication service), then
   it may generate a new signature on the modified
   message. Alternately, the middlebox may be able to sign with some
   other identity that it is permitted to assert. Otherwise, the
   recipient cannot rely on the RFC 4474 Identity assertion, and the
   DTLS-SRTP call set up will fail or be marked as a call with an
   unknown peer.

I have just refreshed this document, because it had expired:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-drage-sip-essential-correction-03.txt

All that has changed in this version is the correction of a typo. 

I would also draw your attention to the following link (also contained in the draft):

http://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/Essential_Corrections_Tracking

This gives the current status of the esssential corrections work.

Regards


Keith

While I understand the logic above, it isn't very satisfying.
People are constructing sip based phone systems that must compete with 
traditional phone systems. If the sip based system shows no identity 
when a traditional system can display the identity of the same caller, 
then the sip system will be perceived and broken and non-competitive.

There will of course then be a temptation to do whatever is necessary 
to make the product competitive.

And displaying the full URL is often not a good alternative. At best it 
will be perceived as "geeky" and incomprehensible by grandma.

I think that seem to highlight all the problems so I can live with  
that if we can just get this done.

What about changing

to

it may be less confusing to simply identify the call as encrypted but  
to an unknown peer or to identify the call as insecure and show only  
the 17005551008 portion of the peers identity.

I'm not sure if that is better or worse but it seems to be one of the  
few way we have to address the issue Paul raised.

If we had a way to indicate that the identity is untrusted in the 
display to the user, that might be acceptable.

BUT, we have a world full of devices that don't have an established way 
to indicate that. So when the call ends up going to one of them, there 
remains the choice of displaying the (untrusted) number with no 
disclaimers, or not displaying it.

The PSTN world has the same issue. Their choice has typically been to 
display it. That may have been justified once, when the phone network 
was relatively closed and those with the ability to forge their identity 
were few. Its no longer true, for a variety of reasons. And we are 
making it increasingly less true.

Perhaps we just have to accept the fact that entirely untrusted 
callerids will be displayed with no indication that they are suspect. 
But that then devalues doing anything secure, since the users won't be 
able to tell the difference.

This line of questioning actually touches on two different issues -- 
disambiguation between the bodies of ad-hoc subscriptions and XCAP diff 
subscriptions, and conveying XCAP diff subscriptions in ad-hoc lists. In 
response to Robert's query, I'm proposing a set of actions to address 
both cases.

   1. The draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services document (which forms the
      basis for the ad-hoc SUBSCRIBE list usage Robert is referring to
      above) includes a Content-Disposition field that must be set to
      "recipient-list" for the various ad-hoc list uses. This should be
      sufficient to disambiguate between ad-hoc list usage and XCAP diff
      subscriptions.

          * For the purpose of clarity (and, coincidentally, to address
            an IESG comment), we will be updating the definition of the 
            "recipient-list" content disposition to read: "The body
            contains a list of URIs to which URI-List Services are to be
            applied."

          * For additional clarity and some level of consistency, I
            would *STRONGLY* recommend that the XCAP diff event package
            define a "Content-Disposition" field specific to its use of
            the "application/resource-lists+xml" MIME type.

   2. Although this answer ("use Content-Disposition") addresses the
      ambiguity that Robert had been worried about, it doesn't address
      the implied question about how one combines ad-hoc list usage with
      XCAP diff subscriptions. In fact, this can be generalized to:
      "when using ad-hoc list subscriptions, how does one convey the
      information that would usually go in the SUBSCRIBE bodies?" This
      is something we didn't actually consider in
      draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-subscribe. To address this issue, I have
      put together a proposal for conveying this information in ad-hoc
      list subscriptions:

       
      <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roach-sip-list-subscribe-bodies-00.txt>

Comments on the proposed solutions -- and the draft in particular -- are 
appreciated.

True enough but consider that we are providing a service here far  
beyond anything the PSTN offers. My PSTN phone has no way of  
displaying if the caller id is secure or not - that is because the  
PSTN does not offer security caller-id in any sense of the why we are  
using secure here. The PSTN does not have a way of telling me no one  
is sitting outside my house with a but-set and listening to my call  
because the PSTN simply is not capable of offering that service.

We all know that it is trivial to spoof caller-id on the PSTN, and it  
is trivial to do on path "taps" to listen in on a POTS call. The user  
interface of POTS devices was not designed in any way to able to  
indicate that this a call was not "secure" in this way because it was  
never "secure" against these and more importantly, whatever level of  
"secure' it was, it was about the same for all calls so there was no  
need for an variant indication of level of security.  Now in SIP, we  
have some calls that are "secure" in this way and some that are not -  
we need some user interface to indicate that. I'm not surprised that  
the user interfaces designed for the PSTN are not capable of  
indicating this - I see no way around that.

So this leads us to why I think Dean's proposal is the right path  
forward. It gets us to go publish and complete the best approach we  
know how to deal with this problem now while clearly indicating the  
limitations of this approach when trying to use the PSTN or VoIP  
systems that closely emulate the PSTN in addressing architecture,  
transitive trust architectures, and user interfaces. I mostly agree  
with the points you are making, I just think that the ideal solution  
of security beyond what the PSTN was deigned for and 100% backwards  
compatibility with the PSTN is impossible and this approach is well  
worth publishing because it does provide real solutions for a  
significant number  of deployment models.

Its not just a UI problem - the problem is that the identity really IS 
just +17005551008 - without the domain. I don't need the domain to dial 
it from a phone. So even if the UI could render a domain, I don't think 
it makes sense to do so.

That said, another possible approach here is to more loosely couple 
DTLS-SRTP to 4474. It is my understanding that what DTLS-SRTP needs is 
integrity of the signaling to protect the fingerprint from modification. 
Any mechanism which provides message integrity would do. RFC4474 is one 
way, but there are others. HBH TLS, for example, would also provide 
integrity services, though not against rogue servers. Of course, we 
don't have protection against rogue servers with 4474 either in cases 
where phone numbers are used...

So my suggestion is to have DTLS-SRTP just state that it requires some 
form of integrity services from signaling, to list some choices in what 
that can be. I think its also really important to point out that, even 
in the absence of any message integrity mechanisms at all, it requires 
an ACTIVE attack in order for a third party to eavesdrop or modify 
media. Whereas with sdescriptions, passive attacks can be launched if an 
attacker can observe the keying material at some point along the 
signaling path. That alone is a big improvement IMHO.

The domain of the E.164 is unimportant (or arguably non-existent).  
What are important are: 1) the identity of the SIGNER of the Identity  
header field, and 2) What kind of claims they are making about the  
strength of their identity assertion. RFC 4474 provides for #1, but  
allows for no differentiation in #2. So what I was hoping the  
disclaimer in DTLS-SRTP would do is provide that disclaimer, something  
like "Authentication servers may not be able to verify the orignator  
of a call received from the PSTN, but need to add an Identity header  
for DTLS-SRTP. Therefore, recipients of requests having RFC 4474  
Identity header fields used with DTLS-SRTP MUST NOT presume that the  
Identity header asserts anything about the originator of the call."

If we extended RFC 4474 to have "strength of assertion" indicators,  
then  we wouldn't have to have this warning.

True.  Dan and others have proposed alternative integrity techniques  
derived from RFC 4474.

It also requires that the integrity function be testably present by  
the UA. We don't want another "last hop exception", where the proxy in  
front of the UA provides the integrity check.

This document largely looks good to me. I have only one substantive 
comment to make.

Section 8 has the following text:

>    The situation with 'multipart/related' is similar.  Per [RFC2387], a
>    UA processing a 'multipart/related' body processes it as a compound
>    object ignoring the disposition types of the body parts within it.

This is, indeed, consistent with RFC 2387. However, RFC2387 is geared 
towards content in email messages. The constraint, in that context, 
makes a lot of sense -- it would be bizarre to, for example, have an 
HTML page (disposition inline) with subservient images tagged as 
attachments. In an email context, it makes sense to treat the whole 
multipart/related document as monolithic.

When we consider the kinds of things we're doing with 
content-disposition in SIP lately, this logic falls apart. We're no 
longer simply indicating whether something should be shown as part of an 
email or saved as a local file; we're indicating fairly complex 
semantics that help disambiguate uses of MIME types that might otherwise 
be confused with each other -- see, for example, my message a few hours 
ago talking about how we disambiguate ad-hoc list subscriptions from 
XCAP diff subscriptions (which use the same MIME type by default).

In that context, the use of Content-Disposition on individual parts of a 
multipart/related document makes a *huge* amount of sense. I think the 
sip-body-handling document needs to take into consideration the needs of 
the SIP protocol in this case, rather than reinforcing restrictions from 
RFC 2387 that really only make sense for email.

This document is good and looks ready to go to IESG.

One thing I think should be changed  - it says "Consequently, UAs MUST  
use the binary transfer encoding for binary payloads in SIP."
I actually believe that the binary transfer encoding is the right  
choice for all payloads regardless of if they are binary or not. (It's  
not like you are going to base64 encode the some ascii body). All  
binary means is the bits will get transfered without being molested -  
which is alway true for SIP since all the body handling is 8 bit safe.

So the change I would suggest would be to simply change "for binary  
payloads" to "for payloads". I think we had consensus on this in a HUM  
in a WG meeting back in 2004. A more detailed explanation of why think  
this is in

      INVITE fixes [RFC4320])"
is probably about the right level.

As a general point, each SIP RFC that is not normatively referenced and
mandated by RFC 3261 is an optional part of SIP. So some "core" things
like support for receipt of REFER and support for receipt of Replaces
cannot be assumed. This has encouraged B2BUAs to use 3PCC techniques to
cover common functions such as call transfer. Another non-mandatory
capability is support of receipt of UPDATE, which is a much cleaner way
of doing things like session timer refresh, for example (avoids a
further SDP offer-answer exchange). Maybe it can't be included in the
scope of advancement to Draft Standard, but mandating some of these
things (at least support on receipt) might be worth considering.

I haven't thought about it in detail, but some initial comments:

- I am sure we will find quite a few things that have to be taken out,
because of lack of implementation. One big one might be S/MIME.
- If we no longer include RFC 2543 compatibility, we might also consider
incorporating those aspects of RFC 4916 that allow the From URI to
change mid-dialog (but not the SIP Identity bits).
- I was surprised to see RFC 3204 in the dependencies, but it seems it
is just for the handling parameter. Perhaps that could just be moved
into the Draft Standard rather than trying to move RFC 3204 to Draft.
- I am sure the implementation report will need some explicit statements
on SIPS.
- SDP is now RFC 4566 (mentioned in 1.2 but not in section 2).
- Under extensibility mechanisms, handling of unknown bodies or body
parts.
- " - Demonstrate that someone will cut and paste this list into some
         inappropriate place without reading it before it's had review"
- this will probably be the easiest one to demonstrate!

I have just requested publication of draft-ietf-sip-hichhikers-guide-05

The following is the proto writeup that goes with the publication
request.

PROTO writeup for
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-
05: "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"

   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
          document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

Keith Drage

The document has been reviewed and is ready for forwarding to IESG for
publication.

   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

WGLC was initiated in the SIP WG on draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-03
on 15th October 
2007 with comments requested by 29th October 2007.

Review was made and comments were received from: Francois Audet, Mary
Barnes, Andrew 
Booth, Spencer Dawkins, Martin Dolly, John Elwell, Avshalom Houri,
Cullen Jennings, 
Joerg Ott, Brian Stucker, Abigail West. During the course of the work
comments have also 
been made by: Diego Besprosvan, Spencer Dawkins, Keith Drage, John
Elwell, Cary 
Fitzgerald, Miguel Garcia, Vijay Gurbani, Michael Hammer, Alan
Hawrylyshen, Paul Kyzivat, 
Dave Oran, Dan Romascanu, Brian Rosen, Henning Schulzrinne, Henry
Sinnreich, Samir 
Srivastava, Hannes Tschofenig, M Vasudeva, Dean Willis.

It should be noted that once published as an RFC, this is a document
that will need to 
be regularly revised, as and when sufficient new SIP material is
published to justify a 
new version.

There has been a key discussion on the which documents should be
included. In particular 
example documents like draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples have been
specifically 
excluded. This received some discussion in the WGLC and RAI review
without consensus 
being obtained. As this document is probably subject to revision in the
future, if 
experience proves that the decision to exclude these documents was
wrong, then it can be 
reversed in the next published version. There is a fine line in some
cases as to whether 
to include a draft/RFC or not. In these cases we are looking to the
reader community to 
address the positioning of this line in future editions. Attention is
drawn to the 
following statement in the document:

   It is very difficult to enumerate the set of SIP specifications.
   This is because there are many protocols that are intimately related
   to SIP and used by nearly all SIP implementations, but are not
   formally SIP extensions.  As such, this document formally defines a

   o  RFC 3261 and any specification that defines an extension to it,
      where an extension is a mechanism that changes or updates in some
      way a behavior specified there.

   o  The basic SDP specification, RFC 4566 [RFC4566], and any
      specification that defines an extension to SDP whose primary
      purpose is to support SIP.

   o  Any specification that defines a MIME object whose primary purpose
      is to support SIP

   Excluded from this list are requirements, architectures, registry
   definitions, non-normative frameworks, and processes.  Best Current
   Practices are included when they normatively define mechanisms for
   accomplishing a task, or provide significant description of the usage
   of the normative specifications, such as call flows.

   The SIP change process [RFC3427] defines two types of extensions to
   SIP.  These are normal extensions and the so-called P-headers (where
   P stands for "preliminary", "private", or "proprietary", and the "P-"
   prefix is included in the header field name), which are meant to be
   used in areas of limited applicability.  P-headers cannot be defined
   in the standards track.  For the most part, P-headers are not
   included in the listing here, with the exception of those which have
   seen general usage despite their P-header status.

Attention is drawn to the fact that an Informational RFC, RFC 3325, is
listed as a core 
SIP specification. This received widespread discussion on the list at
the time it was 
included, and there was unanimous consensus that it should be so listed.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization, or XML?

While the document indicates documents outside the SIP WG, the document
underwent the 
RAI review process in parallel with working group last call, and during
this was 
extensively reviewed by experts from those other groups. The document
shepherd considers 
that no further external review from an external specialist is
necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this document
          been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the
          disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on
          this issue.

The document summarises a large number of SIP protocol related documents
and does not 
introduce new technical requirements. The document shepherd therefore
has no concerns 
with the document.

There have been no IPR disclosures on this document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

The needs for such a document has been well indicated on the SIP mailing
list. It may be 
concluded that there is strong support throughout the working group, and
throughout the 
RAI area, for such a document.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.)  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?  If the document
          does not already indicate its intended status at the top of
          the first page, please indicate the intended status here.

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is believed 
that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

For ID-NITS the checks against idnits 2.08.10 reports the following. It
should be noted 
that these are significantly outdated references to drafts. As the
intent is that the 
document is published with whatever the latest version is that applies,
it does not seem 
relevant to publish a new version to allow IESG and IETF review. The WG
did investigate 
leaving the version number off altogether, but this creates problems in
XML2RFC to do 
this easily. Drafts continue to be published in later versions.

     Summary: 0 errors (**), 23 warnings (==), 3 comments (--).


   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document is an informational RFC, contains no RFC 2119 language, and
all the 
references are therefore correctly informative.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document's IANA
          Considerations section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggest a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the
          document describes an Expert Review process, has the Document
          Shepherd conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that
          the IESG can appoint the needed Expert during IESG Evaluation?

There are, correctly, no IANA considerations from this document.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document contains no material written in a formal language, and as
such there are no 
validation requirements.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

          Technical Summary
             Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract
             and/or introduction of the document.  If not, this may be
             an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract
             or introduction.

          Working Group Summary
             Was there anything in the WG process that is worth noting?
             For example, was there controversy about particular points
             or were there decisions where the consensus was
             particularly rough?

          Document Quality
             Are there existing implementations of the protocol?  Have a
             significant number of vendors indicated their plan to
             implement the specification?  Are there any reviewers that
             merit special mention as having done a thorough review,
             e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a
             conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?  If
             there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type, or other Expert Review,
             what was its course (briefly)?  In the case of a Media Type
             Review, on what date was the request posted?

          Personnel
             Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Who is the
             Responsible Area Director?  If the document requires IANA
             experts(s), insert 'The IANA Expert(s) for the registries
             in this document are <TO BE ADDED BY THE AD>.'

Technical summary.

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous
specifications that 
have been produced by the IETF.  It can be difficult to locate the right
document, or 
even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This
specification 
serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists the specifications
under the SIP 
umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups them into categories.

Working group summary.

There is strong consensus in the working group to publish this document.


Document Quality

This document is a summary or compendium of the IETF publications
relating to SIP, and 
as such, contains no requirements or RFC 2119 language, and as such
there is no 
requirement for implementation of this document. The document underwent
thorough review 
by a number of experts in both working group last call, and through the
RAI area review 
process.

It should be noted that once published as an RFC, this is a document
that will need to 
be regularly revised, as and when sufficient new SIP material is
published to justify a 
new version.

Personnel

The document shepherd for this document was Keith Drage. The responsible
Area Director 
was Cullen Jennings. The IANA Expert(s) for the registries in this
document are <TO BE 
ADDED BY THE AD>.

If folks have comments on this they now would be a good time to send  
them  -.. the BMWG is planning on taking on some SIP work. It will not  
be possible to schedule bmwg meetings such that don't conflict with  
RAI meetings thought we can try to keep them from conflicting with SIP  
and SIPPING. The message say July 9 but I suspect that things received  
by IESG before July 15 will be considered.

> Description of Working Group:
>
> The major goal of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group is to  
> make
> a series of recommendations concerning the measurement of the
> performance characteristics of various internetworking technologies;
> further, these recommendations may focus on the systems or services  
> that
> are built from these technologies.
>
> Each recommendation will describe the class of equipment, system, or
> service being addressed; discuss the performance characteristics that
> are pertinent to that class; clearly identify a set of metrics that  
> aid
> in the description of those characteristics; specify the methodologies
> required to collect said metrics; and lastly, present the requirements
> for the common, unambiguous reporting of benchmarking results.
>
> To better distinguish the BMWG from other measurement initiatives in  
> the
> IETF, the scope of the BMWG is limited to technology characterization
> using simulated stimuli in a laboratory environment.
> Said differently, the BMWG does not attempt to produce benchmarks for
> live, operational networks. Moreover, the benchmarks produced by  
> this WG
> shall strive to be vendor independent or otherwise have universal
> applicability to a given technology class.
>
> Because the demands of a particular technology may vary from  
> deployment
> to deployment, a specific non-goal of the Working Group is to define
> acceptance criteria or performance requirements.
>
> An ongoing task is to provide a forum for discussion regarding the
> advancement of measurements designed to provide insight on the  
> operation
> inter-networking technologies.
>
> In addition to its current work plan, the BMWG is explicitly tasked to
> develop benchmarks and methodologies for the following technologies:
>
> * MPLS Forwarding: Develop specific methods to characterize the
> latency
> and forwarding performance of MPLS devices, extending the
> fundamental
> recommendations of RFC 1242 and RFC 2544 to this networking
> technology.
>
> * SIP Networking Devices: Develop new terminology and methods to
> characterize the key performance aspects of network devices using
> SIP,
> including the signaling plane scale and service rates while

Ok, I've just submitted -02 of the INVITE fix draft.

There is one really big change to correct the bug Brett found in the  
thread below.
There's a new state in the INVITE client transaction and an associated  
new timer.

The attempt to reuse Completed as in the previous draft  didn't work  
out -
Setting Timer D to 0 for TCP caused the wrong things to happen if we  
were in
that state waiting for additional 2xxs. So, instead of always setting  
Timer D to 64*T1,
regardless of transport,  this draft uses a new "Accepted" state  
instead. This way
transactions that get a 3xx or greater response over TCP can still go  
away quickly.

There's a smaller related change - 3261 had setting Timer D at SHOULD  
strength.
I can't remember why that wasn't a MUST (and neither can anyone I've  
asked), and
it _really_ breaks things if it doesn't get set when using UDP, so  
I've changed that
to a MUST in this draft.

Please review this carefully. (We really need a _lot_ of people to  
think about it, not
just a few).

Jan -

Thanks for providing this review. I don't see evidence of a reply when  
you first sent this in - my apologies.

I'm doing some touchup on the draft now as we're preparing to request  
publication and will address your
feedback here as indicated inline:

I'll work this into the existing text - I agree that it helps get the  
message across.
I don't think we need to redraw the picture to reinforce it though.

I've updated fork-loop-fix to address some nits found while preparing  
the publication request
and I incorporated some WGLC feedback that was previously unaddressed.

Here's the changelog:

9.1.  -06 to -07

       Cleaning up some things based on WGLC and review for publication
       request (like refreshing references)

       Added a sentence to the overview discussing what a client might  
do
       if it got a 440

       Reinforced that a UAC will ignore a Max-Breadth header

       Updated the reference to CRC32C - from 3309 to 4960

       Integrated fixes from Jan Kolomaznik's review

The updated draft is at

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-07.txt

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies
	Author(s)       : R. Sparks, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-07.txt
	Pages           : 24
	Date            : 2008-07-03

This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP
proxy behavior.  This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP
networks where a small number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP
requests can stimulate massive amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic.
This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies
when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one
destination).  It also corrects and clarifies the description of the
loop-detection algorithm such proxies are required to implement.
Additionally, this document defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for
limiting the number of concurrent branches pursued for any given
request.

Hi Cullen,

I would still like to stress that, even if the payload is binary, you 
still need to use the binary transfer encoding. What about the following 
change:

OLD:
   Consequently, UAs MUST use the binary transfer encoding for binary
   payloads in SIP.

NEW:
   Consequently, UAs MUST use the binary transfer encoding for all
   payloads in SIP, including binary payloads.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Hi Adam,

the problem with redefining stuff that was already defined in email is 
that we may lose the ability to use it as originally defined. For 
example, if I want to send you a MESSAGE request with the html page in 
your example (which includes images), I would probably use 
multipart/related (as in the email in your example). If we redefine 
multipart/related, we may face problems because I may not be able to use 
it like that any longer.

In any case, do we have any existing extension that sends 
multipart/related in a different context than the one above?... because 
we may not need to use it in other contexts after all.

The real question is whether or not we need the ability to have 
extensions that use multipart/related where the content disposition of 
the multipart/related plus the content types of the body parts are not 
enough to understand how to process the extension.

The thing is that, when I talked with the apps folks (they reviewed the 
draft), they stressed the fact that they do not like it when we redefine 
stuff that they had previously defined because they expect it to work in 
a certain way when it actually works in a different way. The guideline 
we got was that, if we need to define something new, we should really do 
that instead of redefining an old mechanism. So, if we really have the 
requirement above, maybe it is better to define something new than to 
reuse multipart/related.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

My plan is to submit the publication request on this document on close

The last few changes are minor, but if you think you need to reread this

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts

This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies
	Author(s)       : R. Sparks, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-07.txt
	Pages           : 24
	Date            : 2008-07-03

This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP
proxy behavior.  This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP
networks where a small number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP
requests can stimulate massive amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic.
This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies
when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one
destination).  It also corrects and clarifies the description of the
loop-detection algorithm such proxies are required to implement.
Additionally, this document defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for limiting
the number of concurrent branches pursued for any given request.

I'm not proposing that we redefine it -- I'm proposing that we relax a 
restriction that makes sense for email but not for SIP.

RFC 4662 does.

The need for clear Content-Disposition differentiation is highlighted by 
the exchange Robert and I had a few days ago (subject line "Possible 
semantic confusion w/ bodies in subscribes"); in particular, look at the 
examples in 
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roach-sip-list-subscribe-bodies-00.txt>. 
If we can't put content dispositions on the individual parts of 
multipart/related documents, the disambiguation of 
application/resource-lists+xml bodies becomes tricky.

I believe that the draft I cite above provides an existence proof of a 
case in which that is necessary.

In practice, the thing that SIP has redefined here to be substantially 
different from MIME isn't the use of multipart/related -- it's the use 
of Content-Disposition. Because Content-Disposition really does mean 
something quite different in SIP than it does in email, the 
email-specific restrictions on it just don't make any sense here. If we 
could go back and do it over, I would suggest that the proper thing to 
do would be defining a new MIME header -- something like 
"Content-Context" -- but that ship has sailed.

Dear all

I wonder if there is commercial pure VOIP via SIP now. I only see the
commercial SIP to PSTN. Where I can find the commercial pure SIP
(similar to the example in RFC3261, atlanta.com or biloxi.com). Is there
any commercial SIP server I can register for SIP service just like I
register Hotmail or Gmail for email service?  Thanks

Best regards
Yuantao

I agree with Paul here.  We register (on request) existing "wild"  
usages (Cisco INFO, Sonus INFO, MSML, Nortel INFO, Others?) and  
existing negotiated usages (MSCML). We offer the "right" way of doing  
UUI, WITH A DIFFERENT METHOD, BECAUSE AS DEMONSTRATED, ANY OTHER USE  
OF INFO WILL NOT BE INTEROPERABLE WITH OLD INFO, and do registrations  
for that method.

Capiche?

Adam,

I have to admit that I still haven't grokked the distinction between 
multipart/mixed and multipart/related. I gather this discussion is 
specific to related, not mixed. So would the issues you raise not be of 
concern if we used mixed rather than related to carry the multiple parts?

	Thanks,
	Paul

   I wonder if there is commercial pure VOIP via SIP now. I only see the
   commercial SIP to PSTN. Where I can find the commercial pure SIP
   (similar to the example in RFC3261, atlanta.com or biloxi.com). Is there
   any commercial SIP server I can register for SIP service just like I
   register Hotmail or Gmail for email service?  Thanks

SIP411 is available:  http://www.sip411.com/index.jsp

And the ISN system lets you route calls to many organizations:

Although it's only a testing facility, you can register to
interop.pingtel.com and receive calls through its URIs:

I have submitted the following draft:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-drage-rai-sip-header-process-0
0.txt

I would welcome comments on the proposal.

A new version of I-D, draft-drage-rai-sip-header-process-00.txt has been
successfuly submitted by Keith Drage and posted to the IETF repository.

Filename:	 draft-drage-rai-sip-header-process
Revision:	 00
Title:		 Suggested process changes for handling new SIP headers
and SIP responses
Creation_date:	 2008-07-07
WG ID:		 Independent Submission
Number_of_pages: 12

Abstract:
RFC 3427 currently defines the process for defining and registering new
SIP header fields.  This document proposes that prefixs to header field
names should be discontinued, and that an additional category of
experimental header field should be created.  This document also relaxes
the requirement that response codes are defined by standards track RFCs,
also allowing them to be defined by experimental RFCs.

Regards

Keith

There are two separate questions here.

One is: if we put out this framework, would folks currently building 
non-standard INFO usages use it for their next new proprietary usage. 
The other is, are there existing packages (standard or proprietary) that 
we would move over to this framework?

On the former question - I think the cost of this framework is light 
enough, and the benefit is great enough (much easier determination of 
what INFO usages are supported and will be used), that there is little 
reason for folks NOT to use it. Implementors break standards not out of 
malice, but because they find that what we have produced is not 
sufficient, or too expensive to implement given the value in brings. So 
the key to success is extreme simplicity.

On the latter question - of treatment for existing mechanisms - I think 
DTMF is at least worthy of discussion. It'd be good to get a better 
sense of whether there are some improvements that could be made upon the 
current non-standard technique that might help folks move towards a 
standard mechanism. Given the huge mess that is DTMF-in-SIP right now, 
this deserves a look. I also think we might find value in looking at 
some of the event packages as INFO frameworks - conference comes to mind 
  as a good one. Packages that are almost always used in conjunction 
with a dialog could benefit from definition as an INFO framework - it 
would save implementors the cost of a second dialog for the content.

Jonathan:

You are right and all these messes need to be addressed, but the greatest benefit is coming from ensuring interoperability across the whole product lines when application will be using INFO.

In addition, more intelligent applications will be coming out in near future using INFO schemes, which are yet difficult to imagine.

So, given the environments that we have now, we have to move forward keeping our main objectives of the long run focused - i.e, INTEROPERABILTY.

Best regards,
Radhika

DY> Perhaps this is where we need the device manufacturers to step in  
and provide some UI indication that the identity *is* trusted.  If we  
think about the world of the web, people have gotten used to seeing  
that there is a "lock" icon or a changed address bar when they go to a  
"secure" website with the correct certificate.  We can argue about how  
many people actually check that icon or browser bar before doing their  
online ordering or banking, but nonetheless it is there.

DY> I don't know that there's any way you can go back and retrofit old  
devices to say something is *insecure* or *untrusted*, but it would  
seem that for *new* devices as they are built in the future and  
support the kinds of identity authentication discussed here it would  
be possible to have a UI indication of a *trusted* identity.  If one  
of the market leaders were to do this with their IP phones or  
softphones - and were to market this new capability, it might cause  
others in the market to follow.

DY>Of course, the user experience would be better if this was a common  
icon or symbol across vendors phones/user agents... and it gets  
increasingly complicated as we aren't only connecting "phones" but  
also other user agents, applications, servers, etc.  Still, it would  
seem that the logic would be rather simple "If the identity is  
trusted, display this symbol".  (A challenge, of course, is that many  
IP devices have limited display space, and there is the issue of  
perhaps also wanting a symbol to indicate that a call is *encrypted*.   
A call could be encrypted, have a trusted identity or be *both*  
encrypted and have a trusted identity.)

DY> It's not immediately clear to me that this is something that the  
IETF can tackle (vendor UIs), but it might be something that another  
industry organization like the SIP Forum could take on.

My 2 cents,
Dan

DY> I completely agree with the need for a registry of existing uses  
of INFO.  At least if we know what they are, we can then understand  
what gaps in existing standards may be out there and what areas may  
need more work.  Compiling such a registry also may limit further  
proliferation of new uses as people looking to use INFO may find an  
existing one and use it instead.  (Assuming they think to look for  
this registry instead of just going ahead with doing whatever they

them, so in that respect they *are* "grandfathered".  But I think we  
should provide some guidance to new implementors about how they should  
use INFO.  So compiling a registry of existing uses would be good...  
as long as there was also some way to highlight which of the uses are  
the ones "preferred" by the IETF.

DY> I agree that the key is extreme simplicity.  However, I am rather  
skeptical that we'd see much movement over to the framework from  
existing implementors of non-standard INFO usages.  If you are a  
vendor who has a working solution out there in the field using INFO in  
some non-standard way, what is your incentive to change that *working*  
implementation?   To do so requires changing software at both ends of  
the exchange... I could easily see an environment with servers and  
clients where changing software would require new software loads in  
all the endpoints, etc., which could be quite an involved project.   
Why would a vendor do that?  Especially when the existing solution  
works.  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

DY> I believe we would see *some* vendors make the switch, but I think  
there are a whole lot of folks out there who are just implementing  
things like SIP INFO and then perhaps not even remotely staying in  
touch with what the IETF is doing.  They might not ever learn a SIP  
INFO usage framework is out there and would have no reason to switch.

DY> To a large degree, this goes back to Paul's suggestion that we  
need a registry of existing SIP INFO uses.  Maybe "registry" is the  
wrong word... maybe it's a document or wiki that captures existing  
usages in some way (beyond what is captured in a few of the INFO- 
related drafts).  I think we need to understand how bad the problem is  
(or not) before we can fully understand how many vendors may or may  
not move.

Dan:

The things that you are saying primarily is this: Present implementations by different vendors. If this is what you want as you major objective, you got it.

What IETF wants is this: INTEROPERABILITY. It is the long term objective.

And interoperability is in multi-vendor, multi-product environments in the same large network without being locked into a given vendor product with proprietary implement ions. 

Present implementations are a mess. If people want to have this, they have already got it. IETF does not need to do anything more for them.

	A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line
Internet-Drafts directories.
	This draft is a work item of the Geographic Location/Privacy
Working Group of the IETF.
=09
=09
	Title           : Implications of <retransmission-allowed> for
SIP Location Conveyance
	Author(s)       : T. Hardie, et al.
	Filename        :
draft-ietf-geopriv-sip-lo-retransmission-00.txt
	Pages           : 17
	Date            : 2008-07-03
=09
	This document explores an ambiguity in the interpretation of the
	<retransmission-allowed> element of the Presence Information
Data
	Format for Location Objects (PIDF-LO) in cases where PIDF-LO is
	conveyed by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It provides
	recommendations for how the SIP location conveyance mechanism
should
	adapt to these ambiguities.
=09
	Documents standardizing the SIP location conveyance mechanisms
will
	be standards-track documents processed according to the usual
SIP
	process.  This document is intended primarily to provide the SIP
	working group with a statement of the consensus of the GEOPRIV
	working group on this topic.  It secondarily provides tutorial
	information on the problem space for the general reader.

 From a data structures perspective, multipart/mixed is an unordered 
set, while multipart/related is a tree. The difference is actually 
pretty radical.

You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This issue would go 
away, but the solution would be tortured. We would have to add semantics 
on top of multipart/mixed that, when we were done, would make it 
effectively identical to multipart/related.

If I may draw an analogy -- SDP was originally developed for use in 
things like SAP (RFC 2974) and SIP for multicast sessions. As such, it 
made perfect sense to normatively require the inclusion of contact 
information in SDP (RFC 2327, section 6: "Either an email field or a 
phone field must be specified").

However, when we started doing point-to-point SIP sessions, this 
constraint stopped making much sense. The person responsible for the 
session is the person you're talking to -- mandating the inclusion of 
additional contact information didn't make sense anymore.

Now, we could have elected to skirt this problem by observing, for 
example, that FTP (RFC 959) already contains a means for establishing 
connections -- all we need to do is add syntax for conveying media 
types, codecs, etc. It certainly would be an *effective* way of skirting 
the restriction in RFC 2327 that we don't like.

Or, we could have observed that RFC 2327 gets us well over 99% of the 
way to where we want to go -- save for this one restriction that makes 
no sense in the context we're trying to use it in -- and just use it. 
Happily, this is what we did.

During the long discussions on SIP Identity, some people have questioned
the need for end-to-end identity. This draft states why end-to-end
identity and end-to-end authentication are important.

Not much. I think we're talking about new stuff. I am making the 
assumption that we're not 'done' - we'll see continuing needs for new 
signaling data transfer, both standards-based and proprietary.

DY> 100% agreed!  I *don't* want the mess we have today.

DY> But by the same token, there's not much in the short-term that we  
as the IETF can do about the current mess unless we are prepared to do  
the dramatic step of killing off INFO (and then somehow mystically  
getting the vendors to go along with it and actually drop INFO  
support, which I can't see even remotely happening).  INFO is out  
there... people are using it as a simple messaging channel and are  
doing all sorts of things with it.  Simplicity is useful.

DY> I agree with all those who have said the best we can do is to  
provide a "recommended" way to use INFO with the carrot being that if  
you do it that way you will have interoperability.  I agree with the  
idea that we should have a prominent registry that shows registrations  
that use the IETF-recommended way of using INFO.  Only those usages  
that use the recommended way should be in that registry.

DY> However, I do think there is also value in perhaps a *separate*  
registry that documents existing non-standard and non-interoperable  
usages of INFO for a couple of reasons.  First, we gain a better  
understanding of the problem space and exactly how people are using  
INFO.  Perhaps out of that we'll learn where other protocols could be  
improved so that people would not choose using INFO. Perhaps we'll see  
gaps that could benefit from standardization.

DY> Second, we may prevent further proliferation/creation of new INFO  
uses.  Someone looking to use INFO in their application might find the  
first registry (standard, interoperable) and not find the particular  
usage they are after there. With the second registry (non-standard,  
non-interoperable) they might find a usage there and use that one.   
Yes, we now have a vendor using a non-standard, non-interoperable  
usage of INFO, but at least they have not gone off and created yet  
another non-standard, non-interoperable INFO usage.  If we can limit  
the proliferation of new INFO uses, then there may be more of a chance  
of helping move some of those usages over to standardized,  
interoperable uses over time.

DY> Now, to encourage adoption of the standard, interoperable uses, I  
would suggest that the web page for this second registry be titled  
something like "NON-STANDARD, NON-INTEROPERABLE USES OF SIP INFO" with  
some explanatory text at the top that explains why it would be better  
to use the standard, interoperable INFO uses and provides a pointer  
over to that registry.

Regards,
Dan

I just went and reviewed RFC2387 *again*. I think my problem with it is 
that I don't know where it was *intended* to be used. It clearly wasn't 
*intended* to be used with SIP.

Now that I look again in the context of this discussion, it seems, IMO, 
to be *inappropriate* for many cases where we are likely to have 
multiple body parts in a sip message.

Consider the case of an INVITE that has SDP and a body part referenced 
by an Alert-Info header. These two are not related at all, and neither 
is the "starting" body part. They are each independently related to the 
sip message itself.

So, what uses do you have in mind for multipart/related? Without some 
specific and tangible ones, it is hard to justify making sip-specific 
interpretations of it in this general document.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Dan:

I would not see any dis-agreement with your approaches. Let us see what is actually proposed in the incoming INFO proposal drafts: Interim solutions (may be non-Interoperable) and Long-Term Interoperable solutions.

RFC 4662.

In a closely related vein (the one that shows where Content-Disposition 
may be necessary), see also draft-roach-list-subscribe-bodies-00.

This is a new ID creating the ability for a watcher to request, with 
a subscription, the geolocation of a presentity.  In keeping with 
existing consensus in both the SIP and Geopriv WGs, a new Event 
package is not to be created for this; but that the 'Presence' event 
package is to be used when subscribing for another PA's 
location.  Without a new set of filters, subscribing to the presence 
of another presentity would not yield its  location, because nothing 
currently exists specifying that location was sought.  This document 
defines these filters, and the surrounding semantics associated with 
this 'get' function.

This has been submitted into the SIP WG item because it extends SIP 
Location Conveyance. Conveyance discusses dereferecing a locationURI. 
The ability to request another PA's location is identical to how a 
locationURI is dereferenced. If SIP is going to be used to 
dereference a locationURI that was conveyed to it using Location 
Conveyance - this document defines how this is accomplish. There are 
both ECRIT and Geopriv documents that mandate this ability.

   "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Location Get Function", James Polk,
   6-Jul-08, <draft-polk-sip-location-get-00.txt>

The abstract you included reads:

This document defines how a watcher seeks the geographic location
information from presentity.  SIP Location Conveyance defines how
location is sent from one entity to another unsolicited.  This
document specifies how a watcher, i.e., a Location Target, requests
for specific geolocation state information of a presentity, in
addition to the details within the subscription such as the format
(geo or civic) returned and the frequency of updated location from
the presentity.

Excellent document.  Very useful in my opinion to help explain the  
overall issues.

My one comment would be that section 3 is titled "Why end-to-end  
identification is important" but it isn't really as much about WHY e2e  
identification is important but more showing various use cases where  
e2e identification fails (or succeeds but would be broken by RFC  
4474).  It might be better titled "Examples of identification  
transmission" or something similar.

Thanks for taking the time to write this,
Dan

OK Adam. I had the mis-impression that you were advocating the use of 
multipart/related *instead* of multipart/mixed for those cases where the 
sip message just happened to contain multiple parts.

The examples you cite seem to be cases where there really is a 
relationship between the parts. So I have no problem with what you are 
proposing there.

Regarding the issue under discussion here, of the applicability of 
Content-Disposition to parts of a multipart/related, I'm going to 
reserve judgment. We are currently using Content-Disposition differently 
than it is used in mail, and some of the needs to satisfies still seem 
to exist with multipart/related. But I just don't know enough about the 
nuances of mime to sort out the other side of the argument.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Keith,

I agree with the direction you are going here. The use of P- headers was 
always a problem due to the inability to turn them into standards.

It appears that the portion of your doc related to allowing response 
codes to be defined in experimental RFCs was added as an afterthought. 
Most of the text is about headers, not responses. As a result, there are 
a few inconsistencies in the document:

First: the rules for defining an experimental header in section 3 (which 
will become section 4.2 of the revised document) includes

    2.  The proposed extension MUST NOT define SIP option tags, response
        codes, or methods.

So I guess you can define both headers and response codes in 
experimental documents, but not in the *same* document. :-(

Also: while there is a new column for labeling headers as experimental, 
there seems to be no new column for labeling responses as experimental.

This starts to tie into something that has been bothering me for quite 
awhile:

It is the transition to RFC that causes IANA to update these registries. 
But we know the documents often stay in WG draft stage for extended 
periods of time. During that time it is very difficult for people who 
aren't intimately following the processes to discover these things. And 
with response codes we have ended up with multiple uses of the same value.

Is there some way that we could get these entries made in the IANA 
registries when these are published as WG drafts, with some status code 
that indicates their provisional state?

	Thanks,
	Paul

In the sipX open-source PBX, we've started adding a "References"
header to messages so that they can point to the messages/dialogs that
created them.  This makes it easier to extract from message logs all
the messages that are related to one phone call.  I've written up an
I-D to describe the References header:

Filename:	 draft-worley-references
Revision:	 00
Title:		 The References Header for SIP
Creation_date:	 2008-07-06
WG ID:		 Independent Submission
Number_of_pages: 19

Abstract:
This document defines a SIP extension header, References, to be used
within SIP messages to signify that the message (and by extension,
the dialog containing it) is related to one or more other dialogs.
It is expected to be used largely for diagnostic purposes.

Dale

Howdy,
As the discussions about RFC4474 Identity, E.164, and all that seem of the type that will take a very long time to resolve, I've submitted an ID about a private extension for "Asserter Identity", which works in concert with the P-Asserted-Identity mechanism.  It works very similarly to RFC4474, but doesn't sign quite the same things, and can be used to sign TEL URI's, fwiw.

Comments welcomed, of course.

        Title           : Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserter Identification within Trusted Networks
        Author(s)       : H. Kaplan
        Filename        : draft-kaplan-sip-asserter-identity-00.txt
        Pages           : 18
        Date            : 2008-07-07

This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to identify the asserter of private user identity defined in RFC 3325.  The use of these extensions is only applicable inside a set of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon policies for generation, transport and usage of such information.
This document does NOT offer a general identity model suitable for use between different trust domains, or use in the Internet at large.

So after writing my response to Paul Kyzivat's response to Cullen, I  
thought about it some more and realized that I ought to collect those  
thoughts into an I-D, which I have now submitted.  I did so primarily  
because I haven't really seen discussion of the end user's  
*experience* of working with "trusted identity" (if I missed such a  
discussion, please feel free to point it out to me).  To the person  
using a SIP phone to call another SIP phone, how do they know that  
they can trust the identity of the caller on the other end?    If we  
solve the various issues we are discussing related to RFC 4474, P-A-I,  
etc., what might the end user experience look like?

As I note in the draft, it's not entirely clear to me that the IETF is  
the appropriate body to address this question.  It's more of a "user  
interface" question that is more about how to have users adopt/accept  
a SIP feature and feels to me like it's something more appropriate for  
a more vendor-centric "industry consortium" type of entity.  Something  
like the SIP Forum or some other similar entity.  I'm certainly open  
to comments and feedback along those lines... In the meantime, I  
thought I'd at least throw something out there for discussion.

Thanks,
Dan

Unfortunately, I don't particularly like this document, as it gives a
lot of discussion of various cases, but doesn't present a clear and
unified description of the semantics of multipart body part handling.
So much so that it would take me a long time to verify that the
various rules in the document covered all cases and were not mutually
contradictory.

In a lot of situations, it seems that the rule is "the designer of the
software should be able to figure out what is meant in each particular
situation".  Which inevitably leads to "No, he can't." or rather "He
will think he can, but he'll get it wrong."

But I don't know that we have time to fix that now.

More specifically:

There seems to be no clear statement that "required" and "optional"
mean "required/optional for successful processing of the enclosing
body/body part" -- after all, the enclosing body part may itself be
optional, so "required" and "optional" can only be relative to the
necessity of understanding of the enclosing body part.  Or
alternatively, maybe we don't want this degree of complexity.  But to
avoid it, we would have to ban nested multiparts, or at least, all but
certain specific usages of nested multiparts.

There are a lot of mentions of the 415 response in passing.  As far as
I can tell, it is expected that the Accept header in a 415 response
will contain all the media types that the UA understands *in any
context whatsoever*, but that doesn't seem to be stated clearly
anywhere.  (E.g., it would be reasonable for a designer to think that
the Accept should only list media types understood for the particular
request method.)

In section 5.1 the description is not really correct, as the "This
way..." sentence doesn't follow from the preceding sentence.  A better
phrasing is:

   Each body part within a 'multipart/alternative' carries an
   alternative version of the same information.  The body parts SHOULD
   be ordered in increasing richness of representation of the
   information.  More exactly, the UAS MUST process the last body part
   that it understands, and the UAC MUST order the body parts so
   that the this rule causes the UAS to behave as the UAC desires.

In section 6.1, I see:

   If the parameter [...] has the value 'required', the UAS returns a
   415 (Unsupported Media Type) response.

This is incorrect.  Of course, what is meant is, "If the parameter has
the value 'required', and the body part must be processed in order to
process the entire SIP message, then the UAS returns...", but that's
not what it says.

In section 6.2 there is various discussion of the handling parameter
for parts within a multipart/alternative body part.  But the
discussion could be made clearer by starting with the statement that
the handling parameter is not significant: "The handling parameters of
the parts of a multipart/alternative part are ignored in processing
(the processing is determined by the type multipart/alternative), and
SHOULD be set to optional."  Or should we just omit 'handling' on
parts of a multipart/alternative?

The sentence before that one is peculiar: "If the handling of a
'multipart/alternative' body is required, the UA MUST set the
'handling' parameter of the 'multipart/alternative' body to
'required'."  This seems tautological -- why is it stated?

In section 7.3, it is stated that "If the SIP message contains a
reference to the body part, the UA processes the body part according
to the reference.", but in the next paragraph, it says "Note that,
following the rules in [RFC3204], if a UA does not understand a body
part whose handling is optional, it ignores it."  But these are
contradictory if the part containing the reference is required but the
part that is referenced is marked optional.  In effect, the referenced
part becomes required (or rather, required under any circumstances
where the referencing part is required).  This can conflict with the
desire that all parts of a multipart/alternative are effectively
optional within that part.  What is really intended here?

Dan: A while ago -- maybe early last year -- we had a great
big thread on the idea of showing a locked padlock to impart
the notion of a secure call.  This discussion was in the
context of the sipsec URI draft (see
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gurbani-sip-sipsec-01).  The
allegory we adopted, which is also discussed in the draft, was
that of a "hopping bunny with a lock in its mouth" (as a
tribute to SIP's hop-by-hop security model.)  In any case,
among other discussions that resulted in the thread were
reasons why this is not completely attainable (although at that
time, the work on dtls-srtp was not as advanced as it is now.)

The draft is a good starting point that distills a lot of
the discussion that preceded it, so it may be worth a read.
I will attempt to find the threaded discussion in the mailing
list archives and send you a link to it tomorrow.

Ciao.

Dan,

Thanks for writing this, which I believe is an important part of the
whole SIP Identity discussion going on at present. Even if (as is
likely) the IETF does not standardise such a visual indicator, the IETF
should still give consideration to what sort of indicators are needed
and ensure that its protocols are able to supply sufficient information
for a UA to be able to select the appropriate indicator.

The only other comment I have is that I didn't see anything about the
impact of PSTN interworking. So there would seem to be at least 3
elements that make up the security status of a call:
- the strength of authentication of the peer user or domain;
- the strength of encryption;
- whether the call is via PSTN.

John

I have just requested publication of draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-07 as
a proposed standard.

The PROTO writeup follows:

PROTO writeup for
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-fork-
loop-fix-07.txt: " Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in 
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies"

   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
          document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

Keith Drage

The document has been reviewed and is ready for forwarding to IESG for 
publication as a proposed standard.

   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

WGLC was initiated in the SIP WG on draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-01 on 
10th April 2006 with comments requested by 7th May 2006.

Review was made and comments were received from: Christer Holmberg,
Jonathan 
Rosenberg, Vijay Gurbani, Cullen Jennings, Jeroen van Bemmel,
Ravishankar 
Shiroor, Dale Worley, Scott Lawrence, Samir Srivastava, Peter Cordell, 
Thomas Froment, Juha Heinanen, Thomas Leseney, David Benoit, Kasturi 
Narayanan, Atul Kumar Jha, Theo Zourzouvillys, Paul Kyzivat, Dean
Willis, 
Michael Thomas, Eric Rescorla.

Key discussion issues have been:

*	Selection of a hash algorithm to be used. Section 4.2.3 of the 
document indicates the results of the discussion in this area.
*	Identification of a more optimal loop detection algorithm (see
draft-
campen-sipping-stack-loop-detect-00) which was not proceeded with, as 
it could not be shown to provide significant improvements for a 
standards track solution.

Some elements of the original proposal were split out in draft-sparks-
sipping-max-breadth-00 and draft-campen-sipping-stack-loop-detect-00.
There 
was also further input in draft-srivastava-sipping-loop-avoidance-00.
These 
documents have not been proceeded with.

The -05 version of the document was submitted to IESG on 2nd April 2007,
and 
was returned from IESG on 13th December 2007. SecDir review of the -05 
version submitted for publication uncovered a variation of the attack 
described in this document that was not reasonably mitigated with loop-
detection alone. The document went back to the working group and the
max-
breadth mechanism (draft-sparks-sipping-max-breadth-01), which was
already 
being discussed separately, was added to this document to address the 
identified risk.

WGLC was initiated in the SIP WG on draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06 on
7th 
December 2007 with comments requested by 21st December 2007.

There was only one response to this WGLC and this was a late response
from 
Jan Kolomaznik.


   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no
external 
review from an external specialist is necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.

The document provides a correction to the existing SIP protocol defined
in 
RFC 3261. The problem has been identified as part of the SIPit 
interoperability testing. The document shepherd has no concerns with the

document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

The proposal has had wide discussion in all aspects in the WG and key be

represented as having consensus amongst all key individuals.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

Normally SIP documents should conform to RFC 4485. However as this
document 
identifies a correction to RFC 3261, it does not need to follow those 
guidelines, but merely has to state the changed to RFC 3261.

There are no conformance issues with RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS the checks against idnits 2.08.10 report no NITS found.

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has appropriately split its references into normative and 
informative references. All the normative references are now published 
standards track RFCs.

There is one informative reference (draft-ietf-sip-outbound) that is not
yet 
published.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
          consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggested a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See
          [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis].  If the document
          describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

The document defines one new header field, and one new response code.
The 
process for adding these is defined in RFC 3427 and those requirements
have 
been completed with. The IANA registrations have been verified to be in 
conformance with the existing IANA registries.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document defines a Max-Breadth header field, defined using ABNF.
This is 
trivial and has been verified to be correct by inspection only. 

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

Technical Summary

This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
Protocol 
(SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP proxy
behavior.  
This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP networks where a small 
number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate
massive 
amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic.

This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies
when 
they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one
destination).  
It also corrects and clarifies the description of the loop-detection 
algorithm such proxies are required to implement. Additionally, this 
document defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for limiting the number of 
concurrent branches pursued for any given request.

Working Group Summary

The document was produced by the SIP working group. There is consensus
in 
the WG to publish this document.

Document Quality

The document has been produced as a result of an issue identified during

SIPit interoperability testing.

Personnel

Keith Drage is the document shepherd for this document. Cullen Jennings
is 
the responsible Area Director. The IANA Expert(s) for the registries in
this 
document are <TO BE ADDED BY THE AD>.

Hadriel,

This is an interesting draft, but I am not sure to what extent it
addresses the e2e identity issues discussed in
draft-elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important, even though that draft is
referenced in section 1.1 of your draft. If a request or response passes
through two or more trust domains, the UA will receive only the
assertion from the nearest trust domain. Also the P-Original-To header
field will not necessarily contain the original To value. By the way,
there is no syntax definition for P-Original-To.

A proxy in one trust domain might pass on PAI (and hence PASS) to an
untrusted proxy. According to RFC 3325, that second proxy, assuming it
likewise does not trust the first proxy, must remove PAI. Presumably it
would also be required to remove PASS headers. This is not clear in the
draft. Section 8 talks about forwarding to an untrusted proxy, but does
not talk about receiving from an untrusted proxy.

Presumably, after removing PAI and PASS headers from a message from an
untrusted node, a proxy could insert its own PAI and PASS headers. Hence
we end up only with hop-by-hop authenticated assertions still.

"For SIP responses, the P-Original-To URI value would 
   typically be the URI of the From header field. Details on the 
   generation of this header are provided in Section 10."
I assume that "this header" refers to P-Original-To. However, I can't
find anything on that in section 10.

John

Dan,

Thanks for writing this. As (John?) said, this subject has been 
discussed before, but I don't think it was ever put in the form of a 
draft - which gives it a bit more tangibility.

A few observations about the draft:

- I think the key here is not the details about the form of
   presentation. Rather it is a matter of boiling down all that
   may, or may not, be available in protocol exchanges into
   some simple concepts that can be expected to be presented to
   end users. The chanllenge is coming up with concepts that we
   believe are capable of being presented on a wide variety of
   devices, and that are capable of being understood by most
   users.

- Your concern over the meaning of the indicator - that it
   isn't about the media - is a real one. I think we need to
   consider the variations that are possible, and how to
   indicate them without getting confusing. If it is only the
   "callerid" that is secure, then IMO the ideal way to indicate
   that is to annotate the callerid display itself. This could
   be some sort of icon as part of that display. Or it could be
   done with color - green for trusted id, red for untrusted.
   (Yellow for id from PSTN?)

   The above solves the problem you are concerned about for
   local conferences. If you can see the identity of each
   party then you can see whether each is trusted or not.

   In cases where the media is also secure some other sort of
   indicator is needed. But providing this kind of information
   in a way that can be understood by everyone is a challenge.
   It gets even worse when when there are multiple media in
   the call, because they may not all have the same security.

I do think it would be well worth the time of the group to work on this. 
We keep working on security mechanisms. But it is far from clear that 
any of them have much value unless that can be reflected to the user in 
some comprehensible way. Starting with what needs to be displayed, and 
then working backwards to what is needed to drive that display, may be 
helpful.

	Thanks,
	Paul

So I went back and trawled through the saved emails and archived
emails to see when we had this discussion.  It was between
May 2006 - Jun 2006 -- 2 years ago.

On Jun 19, 2006 we had distilled the hopping bunny thread
discussions into the sipsec I-D (see
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg14799.html).
In the archives, keep going back to May 2006 and you will
see a long thread that has been re-named many times.  The
source of that renamed thread is an email by Francois Audet when
he was doing the work on sip-sips that started the thread (see
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg14306.html
for the beginning of Francois' email and then track forward to
Jun 2006 following the thread as it is renamed multiple times.)

 From May 2006 to June 2006, if you follow Francois' thread
and all its renamed derivatives, you will get a good idea of
all the discussion that has gone into the topic of user-
visualizable lock icon a la HTTP and the various issues around
it.

The work culminated in the Jul 2006 IETF meeting in a
SIP Security Breakout session where the issue was framed by
Cullen and is captured in the minutes (search for the text
"hopping bunny" in this URL:
http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/06jul/minutes/sip.html)

That I believe is the last word on this topic until now.

Hope that helps.

Ciao.

PASS is intended to only address such issues in specific deployment scenarios, just as PAI is.  I don't think I said PASS was end-to-end in all scenarios - just for a given trust-domain, and yes the scope of PAI and PASS is tied.  The main scenario for its use would be one of a single trust-domain, including one where there are stub nodes/domains attached to that trust-domain but are not technically in it, and are not transits themselves.

For example, a scenario such as: A ---[ SP1 --- SP2 --- SP3 ]--- B
Where SP1/SP2/SP3 are all member of a single PAI trust domain, and A and B are endpoints or Enterprises.

If SP2 is not in the trust domain of SP1 or SP3, then following the rules of rfc3325, SP3 would not believe any PAI received from SP2 (or at least one that doesn't identify an identity in SP2).  If SP3 thus removes the PAI or changes its contents, it will invalidate the PASS signature clearly (which is a good thing essentially), if that's not also removed.  (and you point out something that should definitely be discussed in the draft)

But really PASS is only attesting to the Asserter's identity and what it claims the PAI/POT are.  If SP3 changes the PAI/POT, why shouldn't B believe SP3 over all the others?  It's the trust-domain it has a relationship with.  It's not optimal, but the whole issue is SP3 is claiming a different PAI/POT than what A/SP1/SP2 did.  Imagine this in the 4474 context - if SP3 changed the From/To, what should the behavior be?  The answer is "well SP3 shouldn't change those things", and likewise here.  The "good" part about this is if SP3 gets it wrong, then B knows who got it wrong and can complain to SP3.

The issue though I think you're trying to get to is the ability for an Enterprise to forward calls from outside its domain into service providers, which you've told me before would mean the service provider inserts a PAI which identifies the Enterprise rather than the true originator.  In other words that SP3 will insert a PAI identifying a "default" SP3 identity, even though the request came from A in the previous example.  In my mind that PAI behavior is clearly broken - it's not following rfc3325, and it's not really useful.  If TISPAN wants to make the PAI an ANI instead of a CLID, it should at least define a parameter to indicate it as such for such cases, because the receivers of that PAI will use it for caller-id display otherwise.  PASS signing the PAI in such a case only points out the bad behavior - if SP3 doesn't feel it should be signing such a PAI, then why is it generating such a PAI?

It's shocking how the ID submission tool removes entire sections.  Just kidding.  Yes good catch - will add it in next rev. :)

Right, another good catch - will fix.  I need to say the PAI and PASS fates are shared.

Yes, but not hop-by-hop, rather trust-domain by trust-domain.  It's not panacea, but it covers a lot of ground in the real world methinks, where so far the majority of usage has only one trust-domain (the PAI gets all the way through).

I thought that the beauty of P-A-I was that my telco can happily claim that
I'm the Queen of the Night without all the bother of checking to see if
I'm a soprano, or can even sing that many notes in a row. So I guess
I don't see what the point is being extra sure that the fiction is a super
reliable fiction.

And since it seems to only be within a given administrative realm, why
isn't TLS or many other possible techniques adequate?

It works very similarly to RFC4474, but doesn't sign quite the same things, and can be used to sign TEL URI's, fwiw.

Agreed.

So as I read this comment, there are really two separate issues I see  
here:

1. How do you symbolize the "trusted identity" of the PSTN Caller ID  
transmitted by the PSTN-to-SIP gateway? Assuming we can come up with a  
mechanism to arrive at end-to-end authenticated identity between two  
SIP endpoints, we could get  a "trusted identity" of the *PSTN  
gateway*, but we have no way of really knowing whether the Caller ID  
of the call was spoofed out on the PSTN before it reached the  
gateway.  We therefore can't really trust the "identity" of the caller  
provided to us by the PSTN gateway - even if we can get an  
authenticated *SIP* identity of the gateway itself.  Perhaps this is  
represented to the end user as any other "untrusted" call would be.  
Perhaps some systems could display that this is an inbound call from  
the PSTN?

2. Should the "visual identifier" be for more than just "trusted  
identity"?  In the draft, I specifically was focusing on the issue of  
trusted identity and NOT on the issue of the call being encrypted.   
But in your comments you mention the "security status" of a call which  
is really something more.  In the context of identity, there are  
several possibilities for a call two SIP endpoints:

   a. "Trusted identity" without signaling or media encryption.
   b. Trusted identity with signaling encryption but without media  
encryption.
   c. Trusted identity with both signaling and media encryption.

And really there are another identical three possibilities for a call  
between a SIP endpoint and PSTN gateway, for a total of at least six  
possibilities.  (Since you note you could also add in the *strength*  
of the encryption.)

We are rapidly leaving simple-icon-that-nontechnical-people-can- 
understand land.

And probably getting into nuances (like encryption strength) that may  
be of interest to the more paranoid of us (like me) but not at all to  
the vast majority of people using the actual systems.

My guess is that probably the average user *might* care about:

1. When I dial this number, am I really talking to my bank? (Or when  
they called me, is it really them?)
2. Can I give them my credit card number without fear of some hacker  
in ______ getting that number?

Ideally, they'd get both in one icon or identifier.... but I'm not  
sure that's always possible.  There may be times when I want to be  
sure it really is Hadriel Kaplan calling me but I don't really care  
whether what we talk about is encrypted.  But for many SIP endpoints  
is it desirable - or even possible - to have multiple icons?

It's an interesting problem.

It identifies who wrote the fiction, and the receiver can decide if they believe the writer (e.g., based on a reputation system); or if it is fiction can know who wrote it and let them know. (most operators don't intend to write fiction :)

And I should note 4474 has a similar issue - the signer can change the From to whatever before signing - except at least 4474 constrains the scope of that fictional identity to the signer's domain name in the URI.  In theory that makes it pretty good, because the signer can only lie about their own users, but in practice if the URI is treated as an E.164 then the scope isn't constrained.

It's not within a given administrative domain - it's within a PAI trust-domain, which in practice often contains multiple administrative domains.

Indeed, DKIM has the same constraint as well.  What I'm not entirely
getting is why 4474 isn't sufficient for the overall goal. And if 4474
doesn't cover the needed headers, wouldn't a better fix be to change
4474 to allow more headers to be signed ala DKIM's h= tag instead
of rolling yet another scheme?

In any case, P-A-I still seems like a different animal than 822-like
addresses which at least can be anchored in a given domain. DKIM
has the capability of signing messages that don't necessarily correspond
to any outside header, but AFAIK that capability isn't being used for
much... which sort of implies that it's either useless which SIP should
avoid, or useful which SIP backfill. Since we don't know the answer
to that quesion, wouldn't it be better to wait and see?

See:

http://tools.ietf.org/rfcmarkup?doc=draft-elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important-00
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-uris-change-00.txt

They explain where RFC 4474 breaks in actual implementations.  (The  
key point being that devices in the network like SBCs change headers  
that are part of the 4474 Identity signature, thus invalidating the  
4474 identity.)

That has been a source of debate for a couple years of mailing list traffic. :)
The problems identified so far, I think:
1) Most URI's are actually E.164's, either as Tel's in Sip disguise, or as real Tel's - and 4474 either can't apply to it, or shouldn't, or should - depending on who you ask and in what context.  But E.164 is the elephant in the room.
2) 4474 signs things which many real-world cases will break the signature of, and thus has a deployment problem (whether that's fixable, or by design, is another topic of debate).  But that's another elephant in the room, or maybe a lion, smaller but hairy.
3) 4474 is susceptible to cut/paste attacks - for example the baiting attack.  That one's more like a clown, annoying but probably not deadly.
4) 4474 requires 4916 for called-identity, which some people aren't happy with I think.  That one's more like a camel, a hump some people don't like the smell of.

At least I think that's the main tent.  So basically what we got here is a circus, with some of us trying to tame the animals, while others prefer to sit and enjoy the show. :)

Some of it's the "headers", some the body, some the type of URI.  I'm all for a 4474bis, and I hope we can make one happen.  But if not, PASS may be useful for me.  At least so far PAI sure has seemed popular in my world.

Wait and see what?  You lost me there.

Meaning that it's far from clear how fledgling reputation services are
going to use these identities. What exactly does a signed P-A-I mean
even if we had one? What might a receiver or third party do differently
vs. a signed from, say? Especially when you factor in that P-A-I is
big smelly hack?

Waiting-and-seeing what the reputation folks actually need versus guessing
what they might need, maybe, someday seems prudent to me. That's
doubly true because there's not been much if any uptake of 4474 and
I'm guessing that lack of coverage of P-A-I is not one of the reasons.
Concentrating on _that_ problem seem to me the paramount concern.

Yes, another elephant. :)
A PASS-signed PAI means the asserter generated it for this message.  Right now we have multi-domain exchanges of SIP messages with PAI header fields being used for caller-id.  I don't know what-all a receiver might do with the signed information (though I could guess).  I am only offering to give it more information.  Some folks are telling me they would like to know that the caller-id is legit.  I can't.  I can only tell them that a node which generated a caller-id also owns a cert from a CA they trust, so they have some recourse if it ends up being wrong.  I have no (practical) way to verify the caller-id directly. (And neither does 4474 or DKIM)

There has not been any uptake of 4474 for a bunch of reasons, not the least of which is there's no problem yet, and for some/many cases we know it won't work.  I have no doubt a PASS signature is not the be-all-end-all solution.  But I do know it takes years to get something spec'ed, implemented, tested, and deployed in any scale that will matter.  So I'm trying to do a short-cut, instead of waiting for a problem: thus, an informational P-header.

So let me get this, um, straight: what people really want is to be able
to trust the callerid but that's precisely what we can't provide. Hmm.
And many of things that you point out about breakage with 4474 is
not _really_ a fault of 4474 per se, it's that you're hoping essentially
for the impossible: having a signature survive through a b2bua sausage
factory.

Sounds all too familiar. I agree with the "blame me" stance, and I'm
not dissing the idea of 4474 being more flexible in what headers it
can sign. It's just that this is all very tangled with the possible,
the impossible and the unknown.

I have no doubt a PASS signature is not the be-all-end-all solution.  But I do know it takes years to get something spec'ed, implemented, tested, and deployed in any scale that will matter.  So I'm trying to do a short-cut, instead of waiting for a problem: thus, an informational P-header.

A short cut! Run away! :)

Seriously, if you want a short cut, you too could hack on one of the open
source versions of DKIM and have something that can sign your P-A-I
(in a fit of dementia, I have actually DKIM-signed SIP messages for grins).
DKIM is probably less brittle than 4474, but it too is imperfect against 
b2bua
grinders.

Which all rather begs the question of what problems for what audience
we're really solving for. If it's for reputation people, I'm not sure that
P-A-I signed/unsigned makes a big difference. Of course it's no secret
that I think that lipstick on the tel: uri pig is pretty useless, so I'm 
struggling
if there's anything more here than trying to slay the unslayable.

In theory, you're talking about To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, Date, Contact, 
and the request body. Proxies aren't allowed to change those (with the 
exception of To and From, which are done only in the context of 4474 and 
RFC 4916), and user agents set them before the 4474 signature goes on them.

In practice, the elephant in your elephant (or small hairy predator) is 
the body. You're talking about SBCs, and the thing that SBCs want to 
change that breaks RFC 4474 is the body. And that was kind of a 
necessary hack back before user agents did much in the way of NAT and 
firewall traversal. But any real, commercial user agent I've played with 
in the past five years or so has at least rudimentary support in this 
area, such that body tweaking is mostly unnecessary.

In other words: there's a better solution than body mangling, and it's 
supported by most modern SIP clients. Let's not gut 4474 to maintain our 
older, broken network architectures.

Hadriel tried to carefully explain why SBCs change the body in 
draft-kaplan-sip-uris-change-00.txt.  It isn't because of NAT.

Please read draft-kaplan-sip-uris-change-00.txt.

It sounds familiar because email has similar problem.

SIP's B2BUA 'sausage factory' is akin to email's mailing list 'sausage
factory'.  DKIM managed to engineer a solution to email's mailing list
sausage factory, yes?  

There are now three proposals to engineer a solution to SIP's B2BUA
'sausage factory':  draft-wing-sip-identity-media, 
draft-fischer-sip-e2e-sec-media, and 
draft-kaplan-sip-asserter-identity.


The worthwhile first problem is not reputation, but just a usable 
white-list.  Whitelists without cryptographic identity are only good 
until spammers successfully guess or successfully determine what 
identities are on your whitelist.  With only 10 billion E.164 
numbers in the +1 country code, it shouldn't take them nearly as 
long as it did for spammers to start guessing email whitelists.

(I have a whitelist for *@amazon.com, but only if it came via
one of Amazon's mailers.  This is because spammers learned that
many people, such as me, had such a whitelist.  Criminals that,
today, send email that looks like it came from my bank are likely,
tomorrow, to initiate VoIP calls with an E.164s that belong to
my bank.  I would like to have cryptographic identity standardized
when that happens so that we do not incur an additional two year
delay in getting it standardized and then another year delay to
get it into products.)

In  a general way? No not really. If you have any way to make SIP
play better with manglers in a systematic way, I'd seriously consider
it. DKIM didn't have that luxury, or more specifically we didn't think
anything that tried to get the installed base to do anything other than 
add a
signature header somewhere in the pipeline was feasible. B2BUA's
(etc) are still relatively new critters so you might have say about what
constitutes a "well behaved B2BUA".

I'm sorry, but whitelisting your bank's e.164 seems wacky, Dan. I have
no clue what my bank's e.164 is. Why exactly do I want to perpetuate
my clueless about their numbers into the future with super-signed but
still unrecognizable identifiers? Even with my cell phone it doesn't annoy
me with the e.164 of anybody I'd whitelist; it tells me their name.

I swear that there's something really circular going on here, but I'm just
too dull witted to figure it out.

SBCs and many B2BUAs modify the SIP bodies that contain SDP, and that is not
changable or avoidable.  See draft-kaplan-sip-uris-change-00.txt for why.

Many cellular phones (and some standalone caller-id boxes) will
substitute the incoming E.164 with a name that matches the
addressbook.  That is what my cellular phone does.  I don't know
if your cellular phone does that, or if your cellular phone is 
displaying the name provided by the PSTN.

I'm sorry that you do not have the number of your bank in your
phone.  Please substitute another institution or person, which
you do have in your phone, and for which you would answer the
phone.  I, personally, do not know the number of my bank, either.
It was merely an example of unauthenticated identity and how
a spammer or a criminal can take advantage of unauthenticated
identity; sorry you took it literally.

Yeah, you have completed several years working on identity
for email, but you are telling the SIP community that SIP 
doesn't need identity for SIP.  From my perspective that is circular 
reasoning.

Actually, lots of things change the To and From.  If you built a "proxy" that can't be configured to change 'em, you're probably not in business long.  Of course you're not a 3261 proxy at that point, but more of a b2bua.  Heck, lots of things change Call-id and Cseq and Contact, too.  You're talking like the whole mammal class that changes at least one of those To/From/Call-id/Cseq/Contact things, not just elephants.

It's really not a secret that SBC's change SDP for a whole bunch of reasons that have nothing to do with NATs.  And the list of reasons is actually growing, sadly, not getting smaller.  But that's not the point.  Sign SDP if you feel you need to.  Don't sign something you don't feel you need to.

Right, nothing is really the fault of 4474 - just like nothing about S/MIME or AIB is really their fault either.  Useful at all though, they are not.
I don't disagree though that it's a sausage factory and it'll be a bit of rolling the dice to see if this thing works or has value.

Yup.  It sucketh.

Yikes. That's not a circus -- that's a abattoir. It's a very careful 
analysis of why carriers want all of SIP except for the SIP part.

It looks like it boils down to:

    4.1.1(a) - Some SIP products are broken by either design or
    implementation

    4.1.1(b) - Inter-service provider federation is being rolled out
    without any of the tools the IETF has defined for that kind of thing

    4.2 - Service providers won't deploy DNS, despite it being integral
    to SIP and the Internet at large

    4.3 - (Mostly a symptom of 4.2) People are deploying security
    theater without any of the tools the IETF has defined for that kind
    of thing, and tel: URLs aren't apparently supported, even when E.164
    is the only useful identifier in use. (If you can change the domain
    of a URI and still have it mean anything at all, it should have been
    a tel: URL anyway)

    4.4 - This isn't a stand-alone issue; it's a symptom of 4.1.1(b)

In short -- if we ignore the software bugs, it looks like the problems 
all boil down the service providers choosing to ignore various 
IETF-defined solutions (mostly as they relate to security). Why do we 
think we can come up with a new security mechanism in the IETF and have 
it make half a whit of difference to organizations who are clearly 
hostile to IETF-developed security mechanisms?

[JRE] We could provide the gateway identity as a trusted identity, but
it seems unhelpful not also to provide the PSTN number as an untrusted
identity. Unfortunately this complicates the UI.

[JRE] The average user will not understand the difference between
signalling encryption and media encryption. I think any indication of
encryption should mean that anything the user "sends" is encrypted,
which might include voice, video, messages, pictures, geographic
location, the fact that user A is making a call to user B, etc.. I don't
think it is helpful to give the user separate indications for these - a
secure call indication should mean everything is secure. So what I
really mean to say is that all these different factors should be taken
into consideration before indicating that the call is secure.
I understand that your draft was focusing only on the strength of
identity authentication. However, the padlock on browsers means that the
web site has been authenticated AND that data is encrypted. The average
user might not be able to cope with two separate indicators on SIP
devices for these.

[JRE] To a first approximation this might be just "encrypted" or
"unencrypted".

I'm conflicted here. Its a tricky job to sort out which "security 
combinations" can be meaningfully distinguished to the end user. They 
have to be both comprehensible and useful. And it must be possible to 
convey them via a range of commonly used UAs.

On one hand I think this is not an area that we ought to be 
standardizing - it is potentially a good area for innovation. OTOH, 
without some minimal expectations the whole thing is useless.

I can see a bunch of combinations that potentially might be in common use:

1) for single medium (e.g. audio) calls:
    a) nothing is secure
    b) identity is secure, media is not
    c) both identity and media is secure
    d) media is secure, identity is not
2) for multimedia calls (e.g. audio+video)
    a-d) as above
    *) combos where some media is secure and some not

On top of that, we have the cases where the other end is a gateway that 
we may trust, but which has to represent security properties from its 
far side.

And, there is the distinction between trust based on transitive trust 
domains vs trust based on e2e encryption and certificates.

Clearly this is *way* too much to present to the average user, and 
nearly impossible to present without a sophisticated UI. So it needs to 
be boiled down into just a few alternatives.

John is proposing that it should all be condensed into *two* 
alternatives: secure, and non-secure. In this case "secure" would be 
only cases 1c or 2c above, and everything else would be insecure.

Its my feeling that isn't going to be good enough. For one thing, it 
means that there probably will be almost no secure commercial 
deployments. It also means that vendors will want to "bend the truth" a 
bit - perhaps by claiming that certain cases are handled more securely 
than they really are.

So, I'm leaning towards separating identity security from media 
security, but I think I am willing to roll all media security together.
For identity security, I'm thinking of possibly three cases:
- secure (e2e or via transitive trust with some rules TBD)
- secure to the PSTN (secure as above, to a PSTN gw)
- insecure (all the rest)
I would render this as some sort of annotation on the callerid display.
(Colors, icon, etc.)

For media security, I suppose the same three cases apply. This would 
need to be rendered independently of the callerid display. It might be 
in the media stream itself. (Ring tone?) If in display, maybe it would 
be a lock, rendered in different colors - but separate from the callerid.

I think this is important because callerid is important to people, and 
because there is probably a lot better chance of getting secure callerid 
than secure media. Treating the PSTN as a special case is clearly a 
hack. But again, its probably an important hack because people think 
they know what they are getting with the PSTN (even if they are wrong), 
and trust it more than our new fangled stuff. Also, for quite some time 
most calls are likely to have one PSTN endpoint. Treating PSTN identity 
as totally insecure will distress people.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi, Paul,

This was a helpful note.

("analogy alert") - when I was working at a network monitoring company, we 
were asked to provide traffic counts for IPsec. Looking at customer network 
traces (for large ISPs) we saw way more people deploying ESP 
("authentication plus confidentiality") than AH ("authentication without 
confidentiality") - I'm not sure that we even implemented AH, but I left 
before that feature shipped.

I'm thinking that if we didn't even see much uptake on "knowing who you were 
talking to without confidentiality" at the IP layer - that's what AH gives 
you - from networks operators, we're not likely to be able to explain what's 
happening at the application layer to end users with much subtlety.

So I'd expect a single indicator ("it's all secure") to see more uptake than 
two indicators ("the signaling is/is not secure", "the media is/is not 
secure").

Your mileage may vary, and it's worth noting that my information is about 
three years old, so things could have changed since then...

Thanks,

Spencer

I tend to agree, not just for simplicity, but to capture what people  
really care about, which is in nearly all cases only three things, and  
they are pretty tightly related:

- If I say something sensitive, is only the person/people I want to  
hear it going to hear it.
- Is anybody overhearing what they are saying to me?
- Is either of us hearing anything neither of us said, or failing to  
hear it due to manipulation of the communication channel.

The first is a coupling of authenticated identity and encryption- 
strength confidentiality. The second is media encryption strength  
confidentiality. The third is media encryption-strength integrity, and  
is carefully worded to separate out simple packet loss from detecting  
an active attack.

Note that the above applies equally to non-audio media, such as video  
and text. There are cases where you can make do with out authenticated  
identity if you don't care who it is you are talking to and only care  
that you aren't leaking to anybody else, but those cases are a small  
minority, IMO.

I also agree that trying to mandate the way the state is presented to  
the user is not something the IETF has the skill set to do a good job  
of.

Going onto this tangent however...
My personal preference is for something different from the lock icon  
one sees in web browsers. Rather I like having a "go secure" button on  
the phone that lights up green if the above conditions are met and  
flashes or turns red if they are not. This allows either for the light  
to come on in the few cases where everything works out at call  
establishment time, or allows an attempt to secure the call via re- 
invite, transfer, or whatever, during the call.

This should be resurrected already (that is, in the repository).

This draft _is_ getting cycles, but I do not anticipate a revision  
before Dublin at this time.

By IETF-defined security solutions, are you referring to Speermint, 
which is all about SBE and DBEs?  Speermint has not created an RFC
yet.  Hadriel's document explains in detail what he has seen 
in existing, real-world deployments.  I agree the reality is
depressing.  I have thrown up my hands many times, too.

By developing protocols that meet their needs and work in their
networks -- the same as every protocol that someone will use.  Right
now, 4474 doesn't work.  Right now, service providers are abusing
P-A-I in a way we know will cause harm.  We could sit back and let
them figure out a solution.  Or we could step up and define the
best solution that meets their needs and works in their networks,
and which works best with the academic view of SIP.

There are similarities between the 'Service Providers are 
destroying SIP' argument and the 'NATs are destroying the 
end-to-end Internet' arguments popular in the IETF during the 
1990's.  NATs were (and are) deployed because they met a need.  
The abuse of SIP is being done to meet a need -- it is not being 
done to upset the digerati.

No; I mean solutions like mutual TLS for domain authentication. Or even 
IPSec gateways, like 3GPP has defined. There are secure ways to do what 
service providers want to do. But, for some reason, the idea that you 
can secure networks by whitelisting based on unverified "From" header 
fields has gained mindshare. For some reason, people are still 
authenticating based on source IP address (!!!) instead of using any of 
a myriad of certificate-based techniques. I mean solutions like RFC 3263 
for machine location instead of using point 
codes^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HIP addresses.

I don't think the situations are fully comparable. I understand the 
problems NATs were introduced to solve. You'd have a hard time finding 
anyone in the IETF who doesn't operate at least one NAT of their own. 
It's a sad little secret that we hate them from a protocol design 
perspective, but embrace them for our day-to-day tasks.

Stupid security, on the other hand, isn't something you'll find anyone 
who knows the first thing about computers doing. No one uses stock FTP 
or telnet for real tasks any more -- it's all scp and ssh. But ITSPs 
don't deploy SIP over TLS for reasons I can't fathom. Anyone who knows 
the first thing about IP networks recognizes that it is laughable to 
authenticate based on source IP address. And yet ITSPs insist on doing 
so. The most popular application on the internet has a well-exercised, 
certificate-based, crypto-secure means of determining the identity of a 
server (TLS). SIP, from its inception, has been able to leverage this 
exact mechanism at least for authentication of servers and for 
confidentiality of signaling. ITSPs aren't deploying it.

The problem isn't a lack of available solutions for these kinds of 
problems -- it's the fact the ITSPs are employing the same kind of 
moronic "security" that gave rise to blue-boxing in the 1970s. I don't 
claim that it's being done to upset us; the reasons aren't exactly 
clear. They could be ignorance. The could be intransigence. They could 
be plain stupidity. But there's something there that's preventing the 
adoption of any real IETF-defined security by ITSPs.

Given that as a backdrop, I don't see how our defining Yet Another 
Security Mechanism is going to make one whit of difference. ITSPs aren't 
deploying the stuff we've already done, even the stuff that is 
completely ready for prime time and doesn't get in the way of any 
business needs. How will this effort be different?

Maybe it's the certificates. If ssh required certs to operate, do you 
think it
would have the massive uptake that it's seen? I don't.

Great responses on this thread... replying to the last one:

DY> I agree that I don't think "normal users" out there care about (or  
even know about) the differences between secure signaling and secure  
media.  If we were to ask them what makes a call "secure" they would  
probably almost always think of the media.  I think there is zero  
value in distinguishing between secure signaling and media.  It should  
just be "secure" or "not secure" where "secure" equals both signaling  
and media security.

DY> However, I wonder if there's a need for a separate indicator for  
authenticated *identity*.  If I'm in a meeting and a call comes in and  
the "Caller ID" displayed on the screen is for my wife, I might want  
to interrupt what I'm doing and answer the phone.  If I have some  
unethical salesperson on the other end who was masquerading as my  
wife's caller ID, I'm going to be very upset.

DY> Likewise, when I call my bank and wind up in some call center, I  
would like assurance that I *am* talking to my bank and not some other  
call center that I was re-directed to.

DY> In those cases, I want to be sure of the *identity* and I'm  
potentially less concerned about the "security" of the call (although  
with a bank I hopefully am).   Does this need to be separate  
indicator? Or could this fall into the same as the "secure"  
indicator?  I'm not sure. Given the woeful lack of implementation of  
media encryption, I guess I could see more success of an identity  
indicator being implemented than of a "secure" indicator.

DY> And "- Is the company/organization/person I am speaking with who I

we know with our ears, but for large companies, call centers, etc. we  
don't really have any way to do so.

DY> And such a light look far better in a spy movie! :-)

DY> Seriously, though, this does point out the challenge with "visual  
indicators" and perhaps why they can never really be standardized.  On  
the "hard" IP phone on my desk, having a light like this suggestion  
would be far better than having an icon on the small little display  
screen that is there. (Yeah, I should get an IP phone with a larger/ 
nicer display.)  But if I'm using a SIP softphone, what does that  
light mean?  There, you need an icon or something like that.

DY> Interesting.  I hadn't thought of the PSTN as a special case with  
media encryption but of course it is.  We can do end-to-end media  
encryption from a SIP endpoint to the SIP-to-PSTN gateway but after  
that it's unencrypted.

DY> Agreed.

DY> (laughing) Wonderful statement!  And very true. It continually  
amazes me the degree to which people believe PSTN identity is solid  
and reliable.  But on one level, why not?  The vast majority of people  
out there have probably never received a PSTN call with a spoofed  
Caller ID.

DY> That trust in the integrity of the PSTN identity will probably  
remain until such time as the spammers start abusing it and people are  
getting calls they think are from people they know.... and then over  
time they realize that they can't trust Caller ID just like they can't  
trust sender email addresses.

Regards,
Dan

P.S. Sadly, if you think about it, the components for abuse are very  
readily available... an attacker could have a piece of malware on a PC  
that grabs a users Outlook address book (or similar address list) and  
sends that to the attacker. The attacker could then call everyone in  
that address book and use some VoIP server/system that lets the  
attacker set the Caller ID to that of the original user.   The  
recipients think they are getting a call from someone they know and  
answer... only to get some telemarketing pitch.  The economic model is  
probably not there yet for doing this, but you could see how it could  
be done very easily on a *technical* level.

That works well for handling of this kind of information during the 
call. But I think there are two very different sets of decisions people 
want to be able to make:

   1. Am I (reasonably) certain that the caller identity on my ringing,
      unanswered phone is accurate?
   2. Once I am in a call, how do I conduct myself?

I think your analysis is spot on for #2.

But #1 is a fairly different kind of decision based on a different kind 
of information, and would probably be rendered differently.

Well,

ssh without certs requires that I share a secret with each destination I 
want to connect to. That isn't going to fly for phones.

And while https doesn't require the client to have a cert, it still 
requires the server to have one. So that isn't going to fly (for e2e) 
either.

And as soon as you say "well, maybe it doesn't have to be e2e" then you 
end up back where we are.

Both Dan and Adam have now restated the distinction I was trying to 
make. Hopefully they have been more successful.

One criterion that I think is important, though perhaps irrational, is 
how calls to/from the PSTN are represented. Among all the possible ways 
that the trustworthiness of the callerid may be represented, this case 
had better be one that makes sense to most users. That probably means it 
should not be "no trust at all", because that will be interpreted as 
indicating that this new phone system makes calls less reliable. That is 
why, as irrational is it may be, I'm thinking of three levels (bad, far, 
good / red, yellow, green / ...) where an identity from the PSTN that 
has been secured for the sip portion of the path, probably falls in the 
middle.

You're completely missing my point.

We, the IETF, have developed various security mechanisms with varying 
properties and different levels of complexity.

Even the dirt-simple, well-deployed, proven ones -- like server 
authentication and hop-by-hop confidentiality -- are being ignored by 
the ITSPs.

If they're ignoring the no-brainers, why do we think they'll pay 
attention to anything with even a slight bit of complexity (like signing 
P-Asserted-Identity)?

Do you think that those same ITSP's are still using FTP and Telnet?

Not true, or at least misleading. Anything you can do with a cert, you can
do with raw keys too which shouldn't be surprising since certs are just a
particular manifestation of a key/name binding mechanism.

SSH is a real life example of a mutually authenticated e2e crypto scheme
that basically just appeared at out nowhere to quickly rid ourselves of
ftp and rsh. The fact that IETF keeps ignoring why SSH works and
nothing else does remains a serious problem.

Key centric, leap of faith, and "good enough" manifestly work in real
life. Everything else is suspect.

I don't have enough visibility into ITSPs' operations infrasture to 
register an informed opinion. I wouldn't be surprised, if the same guys 
design their operations infrastructure as do their SIP infrastructure.

I'm not sure how this point plays into the conversation, though -- these 
same organizations all have a valid HTTPS certificate they use for their 
web site.

(Reading this as I just finish FTP'ing files up to a web hosting  
provider.)    Sadly, I think there's still a great amount of FTP  
floating around.  Thankfully, though, I'm seeing very little telnet  
left.

(Tossing on my VoIP Security Alliance (VOIPSA) hat)  So over the past  
couple of years I have been asking this exact question of ITSPs with  
whom I talk - why aren't you using TLS-encrypted SIP.  The answers  
almost always come down to:

1. Performance.  "TLS-encrypted SIP is great in theory but when you  
are terminating 10,000 simultaneous SIP connections there is too much  
overhead."  (My typical response: Can't you get hardware SSL  
accelerators?  Or, gee, giant websites can do SSL for HTTP, are SIP  
connections really that much different?)

2. Ignorance of the security issue. "Well, it's all running mostly  
over my own network? What's the real exposure?" (My response - point  
them to http://www.voipsa.org/Resources/tools.php )

3. Laziness.  "None of our customers are asking for it!"  (My  
response: "Because they don't realize it's an issue and are trusting  
in you to keep them safe. They think it is like the carrier-controlled  
walled world of the PSTN.")

4. Ignorance of the state of the standards/technology. "Well, the IETF  
is still defining all of that."  (My response is to point out that  
media encryption and SRTP key exchange may be still evolving but TLS/ 
SIP is well understood.)

5. Cycles/Staff, aka "We'll get around to it".  With especially  
smaller ITSPs, I often get an answer of something like "it's on our  
roadmap but we just haven't yet gotten around to it".  With limited  
staff and cycles, they say (understandably) their first issue is  
making the system work... and then they'll worry about securing it...  
some day... if they make money... if they hire more staff... then  
maybe they'll get around to it.   (My response - throw up hands in  
dismay and go search for a beer.)

The performance argument, especially, is one I have heard repeatedly  
for TLS-encrypted SIP.  I certainly do understand that there *is* some  
degree of a performance hit, but in this era of high-volume and high- 
performance SSL-encrypted web sites I find it odd that we can't  
leverage that technology into TLS-encrypting SIP sessions.

I think, sadly, that ultimately it will take some kind of "significant  
event" where there is a significant information loss or denial of  
service for customers to start asking ITSPs for it.  Either that or  
perhaps some legislation around privacy or something like that.

In my somewhat jaded opinion, ITSPs are going to deploy "the stuff  
we've already done" related to SIP security when either:

1. It makes them money.

2. It saves them money. (Really a variant of #1.)

3. It reduces their "risk" in a way they can quantify. (A variant of  
#2.)

4. It becomes a market requirement (variant of #1), potentially  
because either:
      a) a market leader adopts it and the ITSPs start losing sales  
for lack of it; or
      b) some event happens where they need to for PR/marketing  
purposes.

5. It becomes a differentiator in the market place for them to compete  
against larger competitors. (Variant of #1, and something I've seen  
from a few smaller ITSPs ("We're your source for secure SIP  
connections."))

6. It becomes a requirement based on government compliance legislation  
or other industry compliance requirements (variant of #1).  (Tip: Get  
VISA/MasterCard to throw SSL-encrypted SIP into the next iteration of  
the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) and you'd  
wind up with rapid deployment.  You can't connect to the VISA/MC  
network if your networks don't meet PCI-DSS.  If you can't connect,  
you can't take credit cards... and we're back to #1.)

My 2 cents,
Dan

I don't know that signing P-A-I is necessarily the answer, but in my  
opinion there are perhaps two reasons why ITSPs might be inclined to  
adopt some form of authenticated identity that we arrive at:

1. PERCEPTION VS. THE PSTN - There's a whole lot of ITSPs out there  
who would like to get your "SIP trunk" business and ultimately would  
like to build their own federated SIP networks to bypass the PSTN  
entirely.  So if you're going to do that, you have to be "at least as  
good" as the PSTN.  Right now, the majority of folks out there have a]  
belief in the integrity of PSTN identity / "Caller ID".  We all on  
this list may understand how easy that identity is to spoof... but the  
majority of folks out there do not.  So if I'm an ITSP building a SIP  
infrastructure and I want people to come to my system, I would think  
that ITSP would not want telemarketers masquerading as other numbers  
on a large scale.... this could lead to customers saying "Hmmm... we  
didn't have these problems with the old system."  I would *think*, but  
certainly could be wrong, that preventing this would be of interest.   
(A savvy ITSP could even turn it into a marketing feature in that they  
provide *better* identity security than the PSTN.)

2. GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE - As an example, the US Congress continues to  
work on Caller ID-related legislation, the latest being last year's  
"Truth in Caller ID Act of 2007" which passed the US House and then  
floundered in the Senate:
   http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-251
   http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-704
   http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s704/show

This bill "amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful  
for any person in the United States, in connection with any  
telecommunications service or Internet protocol (IP)-enabled voice  
service, to cause any caller identification (ID) service to knowingly  
transmit misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the  
intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of  
value..."

I'd imagine that sooner or later something like this will pass in the  
US (especially if there is a public case of identity theft linked to  
spoofed Caller ID) and somewhere in there it may fall to ITSPs to  
prove that they were not the ones altering identity information.

Obviously the IETF is a global organization and so it can't  
necessarily care what the US gov't does... but I'm sure other  
governments will pass similar legislation (if they haven't already).   
At some point I think the ITSPs will have to care a bit more about the  
identity of who is on their network.  If there is an open standards- 
based solution, they'll look at that... if not, they'll look at  
proprietary solutions.

Then again, I could be completely wrong about all this. The warranty  
expired long ago on my crystal ball.

My 2 cents,
Dan

Yes, a bit.  For one, HTTPS works fine as long as the server has
a certificate.  SIP can do so as well, but for TLS connections
between two proxies, both of which have certificates, the mutual
authentication problem is rather new in SIP.  Second, the
temporal nature of a TLS connection is different in SIP than
in HTTPS.  In the latter, clients typically establish many
simultaneous connections to pipeline downloads and then promptly
close them (unless keep-alive is negotiated.  Even if keep-alive
is negotiated, the life of a HTTP transaction is shorter than a
SIP transaction, so closing the TLS connection is a perfectly
good thing to do when a client is done accessing the resource
in HTTPS.)  Third, the whole notion of upgrading/downgrading
URIs does not exist in HTTP, so when you see a https:// scheme,
you know that it is TLS from client to origin server, even in the
presence of HTTP proxies.  Fourth, even in the presence of HTTP
proxies, the certificate displayed to the client is that of the
origin server, which is not the case in SIP's hop-by-hop TLS model,
which has lead to its own set of problems amply documented else-
where.  And finally, in HTTP there is only one transport: TCP.
So TLS-over-TCP accelerators became commodity items.  In SIP, with
the multiple transports to support and the fact that TLS can run
on top of all of them makes it hard to get accelerators that
support multiple transports (maybe EKR or someone else can correct
me here, but I don't think there are dtls accelerators in use
today -- I am not sure whether a TLS-over-TCP accelerator's firm-
ware can be used to support TLS-over-UDP without any modifications.
Even OpenSSL had to be modified to support dtls at the TLS record
layer, so I would assume that any existing TLS accelerator would
have to be so retrofitted.)

Media encryption and SRTP key exchange have stabilized of late, as
have some TLS-specific concerns in SIP through various drafts
like sip-sips and domain-certs, sec-flows, etc.

Sadly, many of these issues exist within enterprise too Adam. SDP gets 
rewritten there all the time and its almost never for NAT traversal 
reasons. Most of them boil down to practical issues that arise from the 
nature of those networks. Examples include transcoding to deal with low 
bandwidth WAN links and 2833 detection to deal with H323 endpoints that 
don't support it.

I'm pretty sure its not malice at work here. Rather, I think its that, 
there are lots of practical issues that got in the way of deploying SIP 
in the 'pure' way it was originally envisioned. I have no doubt that 
folks with working SIP networks would welcome a security solution that 
improves upon the current situation and is actually deployable. So the 
choice we have to make is - do we continue to produce specifications 
that ignore SIP as it is deployed, guaranteeing that these documents are 
of academic interest only, or do we consider "works with actual 
deployments" as a legitimate engineering constraint?

If you are accepting the notion of trust domain defined in 3324 and used 
by 3325, then I think PASS doesn't provide any additional value. If we 
do indeed all mutually trust each other, then why do I need to 
cryptographically verify the asserter?

I would argue that your draft is really trying to make PAI work in a 
different type of 'trust domain' - one in which there are some folks 
that I trust a lot less. So if I have:

stub1 - SP1 - SP2 - stub2

with stub1 and stub2 being enterprises which insert their own PAI, your 
  draft would allow stub2 to determine that it was indeed stub1 who 
inserted the PAI, and stub2 can utilize reputation systems or 
whitelists/blacklists to deal with ones that misbehave.

Indeed, I'd go so far as to say that, your draft is trying to add 
cryptographic assertions to PAI so that it has some possibility of being 
used on the Internet and in topologies that don't fit the trust domain 
definition of RFC3324/5, and in that sense it really is an alternative 
to RFC4474.

What I think is missing from your draft is a clear discussion of what 
attacks are possible in RFC3325 which are now prevented here. Barring a 
reputation system or whitelist of asserters, I wasn't clear there were 
any. Would you agree?

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Robert,

Thanks much for taking a stab at this.

The first thing that probably merits discussion is whether we really 
actually want to move SIP to draft. Looking through the normative 
dependencies, plus the amount of work it will require to agree upon and 
complete the interoperability reports, seems quite daunting. At the end 
of the day, do we think that exercise will improve SIP interoperability? 
Make the life of an implementor easier? Not clear.

Are folks able and willing to commit the time to doing this? That 
includes working out the implementation report contents, collecting 
data, revising the specs, chasing down dependencies, etc. We've had this 
item on our charter for a long time, yet typically make little progress 
on it. Thats kind of a sign that, folks are not viewing it as something 
that is pressing to address.

The biggest complaints I hear about the SIP specs are:

1. there are so many of them; its impossible to figure out what I need 
and figure out which ones are definitely implemented by other folks so 
that we can interoperate,

2. the specs don't line up with reality - SIP barely even mentions 
B2Buas and phone numbers yet these are the more common case

3. there are lots of interop issues - many of which were raised at the 
sip forum session a few meetings ago - that need to get solved

I don't hear too much of, "RFC3261 is confusing since it tells me to 
implement the S/MIME thing and I don't actually need to". That would be 
the main thing we'd get by moving RFC3261 to draft, I think.

So I think the first step is to really figure out, what is the PROBLEM 
out there today, that we are trying to solve here. is it just, "IETF 
process says we should go to draft?". If thats the sole problem, I'm not 
sure its worth the effort.

Flame away...

-Jonathan R.

In practice, the elephant in your elephant (or small hairy predator) is
the body. You're talking about SBCs, and the thing that SBCs want to
change that breaks RFC 4474 is the body. And that was kind of a
necessary hack back before user agents did much in the way of NAT and
firewall traversal. But any real, commercial user agent I've played
with in the past five years or so has at least rudimentary support in
this area, such that body tweaking is mostly unnecessary.

    <br>
In other words: there's a better solution than body mangling, and it's
supported by most modern SIP clients. Let's not gut 4474 to maintain
our older, broken network architectures.

Here are a couple that are both pretty old (one soft, one hard). I
didn't have to go hunting for these; they're just the softphone I have
installed on this machine and the hard phone I have on my desk.<br>

Jonathan,

> Flame away...

These are valid considerations, but it would be much easier to move SIP to
draft standard for _Internet use only_.

Using SIP for closed networks, for a myriad of business plans and models and
B2BUA and other intermediaries is definitely not be doable, though highly
entertaining to watch. Not to mention all those successors to the IN and AIN
(no names mentioned here, but we know them well).

So my vote is in support of what Robert Sparks has proposed, just keep the
scope limited to the Internet model - see the AIB docs what that means.

Lat but not least: Both you and Robert have done a fantastic job to prove
that Internet-style SIP is interoperable, so you have a huge stake in it.

Henry

They are not using them because they do not see the benefit of
them.  The same can be said of ENUM and TRIP, which ITSPs are
either ignoring or 'misusing' (from an IETF perspective).  The
avoidance of RFCs is not at all unique to ITSPs.

But it doesn't matter what the ITSPs do inside their networks -
we can do this without the ITSP needing to do per-transaction
crypto, or TLS, or squat.  If it causes them no harm, causes
them no grief, and lets them continue Business As Usual, it's
a win for them and a win for the edge (their subscribers).

We can provide edge-to-edge identity (between enterprises, or 
handset-to-handset) in both worlds:  the world that exists (which 
has ITSPs with B2BUAs and SBCs) and the world that we hope will
exist (RFC3263 routing on the Internet, perhaps with some
peer-to-peer sprinkled on top).  SIP's current identity mechanism,
RFC4474+RFC4916, only works with the latter.

I want an identity mechanism that works with both.  And I have
long been convinced it is possible to build such a beast.

My point is that we *do* have security mechanisms that are *deployable*, 
like TLS. Not mutually-authenticated-TLS (which is not very widely 
deployed in any protocol), but the normal TLS that _pervades_ the WWW. 
Vijay points out a handful of reasons why these approaches are not 
perfect from a security perspective, but they're certainly an 
improvement over having no security.

So, why aren't *they* deployed?

TLS isn't very widely used on the net though. It's only used on as-needed
basis. SIP is probably not any different in that regard, and even worse
in some ways since there's not any one entity whose self interest is wrapped
up around "this needs to be safer". If you could convince banks, ecommerce,
etc users of SIP to only accept secured calls then you might get some uptake
just like the web, but until then...

The very same entity that cares about identity:  the subscriber
connected to the ITSP, such as an enterprise connected to its
SIP trunking provider.

Ah, so this argues for the media-path identity. I don't have as strong 
an opinion on that yet. My (possibly naive) first impression is that it 
has no better chance of surviving the SBC sausage factory any more than 
4474 does (given that SBCs tend to sit on the media path, too).

But this doesn't give any rationale for signing P-Asserted-Identity 
(which will need to be stripped off as it leaves the enterprise, 
rendering your use case pretty much moot).

Our views clearly differ on the survivability of 4474 identity through 
SBCs and the survivability of other identity techniques through SBCs.

I don't see how to reconcile those views, as there are ample I-D's
written by myself and others that attempt to explain how 4474 fails
and there are three other techniques that exist as individual drafts.

I did not think Hadriels draft was proposing that PAI get stripped at 
that boundary.

 From the abstract: "The use of these extensions is only applicable 
inside a set of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon 
policies for generation, transport and usage of such information."

This means that there's either an agreement with the ITSPs (which I'm 
arguing have demonstrably no interest in making this happen), or the 
information is stripped before handing to the ITSPs. Or am I missing 
something?

I don't think *either* will make it through the networks that Hadriel

The crux of my argument is that the providers aren't playing along.

We're revising draft-ietf-bliss-call-completion-02 in the
Call-Completion committee of BLISS.  It turns out that our design can
be simplified and made more robust toward various difficulties in the
Real World if the the recipient of a SUBSCRIBE request could take the
>From header of the request into consideration when determining the
entity/events that are to be sent in NOTIFYs.

But it does look like having a subscription affected by the From value
has not done before, so we're extending the practice of SIP, if not
the letter of the law.  Use of the From value is not described in RFC
3265, but as one member pointed out, "It doesn't say you can't,
either."

What do people think of this?

The use case:  We want to be able to correlate an incoming SUBSCRIBE
with a previous incoming INVITE from the same UA.  The original idea
was that the SUBSCRIBE should specify in some manner the Call-Id of
the INVITE, but it turns out that in real SIP networks, SBCs often
change the Call-Id, so the caller doesn't know the Call-Id that the
callee sees.  However, it's rather reliable that the From headers of
the two requests will match, as SBCs are likely to change both of them
in the same way.

What if a Target-Dialog header was added to Subscribe by one of the UA?
Will the SBC modify the Call-Id in this header to match the call-id
between SBC and the other UA.

I'll disagree here, why would  xcap-diff need Content-Disposition header 
? There's no ambiguity here since the "recipient-list" uniquely selects 
the right body from the uri-list-services multipart subscription. I 
think it has been made quite clear in the xcap-diff event i-d that it 
describes the very basic stuff (which is indeed quite complex already), 
so if there's need for some more, they can be added in extension specs, 
but imo this doesn't need any additional information.

I'm basically fine with the i-d proposal although there are indeed quite 
many obstacles before it can be utilized in real-life: e.g. credential 
distributions, how to do conditional subscriptions, diff-processing 
changes may cause a lot of unnecessary traffic, and you really need not 
to loose any events etc. So all of this needs probably some 
explanation... So personally i don't see much benefit of implementing 
this for xcap-diff.

I'll have some editorial comments though, first remove all following 
declarations
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" from any example 
xml documents.

Regarding TODO note in 2.2: you can't really define that the cid 
attribute concerns the <entry> element, it is something one of those 
annoying features of the schema tool, so basically the schema is fine, 
it defines a single _qualified_ attribute (one of those things that i 
personally really dislike, too much ugliness  with additional namespace 
declarations, but here it is required because of the chosen extension  
model of the resource-lists format)

(as SIP WG chair)

Dan has posted the following document.

This represents the completion of the WGLC and it is believe all issues
have been addressed.

Dean will be writing this one up for the publication request. While he
is doing this, it would be useful if you checked that all the comments
have been addressed.

Regards

Keith

If you are talking enterprise to some sort of public service provider
you will get both cases happening, and possibly on the same interface
between the two providers.

It may well be distinguished based on whether the traffic is public
network traffic or private network traffic, see the definitions in 

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vanelburg-sipping-private-netw
ork-indication-01.txt
(revision expected shortly)

For public network traffic, the situation you are talking about has wide
acceptance for the PSTN in the US, but virtually no appearance in the
PSTNs of some European countries. When these operators go to IP, you can
expect the same approach to P-Asserted-Identity. 

For private network traffic, I would expect the trust domain to
encompass the enterprise and the public service provider for the support
of such a capability to make any sense, but there are still some awkward
public service providers out there.

Keith

There're a couple points:
1) The trust-domain's transitive nature is brittle - we all know this, and the easy answer is "transitive trust doesn't work" or "that's the nature of transitive trust", but I think there are different levels of what one can and can't believe in for transitive trust - or at least I think providers have different concerns.  For example I don't think providers are very worried about MitM attacks, even in transitive trust domains.  (Or rather they worry about it in a different way)  And I don't think they're very worried about explicitly malicious providers in a transitive trust context.  But I do think they're worried about systems that are mis-configured or more open; or at least I think they will be when peering grows and gets more end-end SIP.

2) PAI's trust-domain is not fully transitive, in practice.  By that I mean some providers trust the PAI asserted by a peer, but not PAI's transited by that peer (PAI's asserted by domains beyond that peer).  Without some asserter identifier it's tricky to figure out the scope of the assertion trust domain.  In other words you could have providers A--B--C, and C trusts B's PAIs for calls originating at B, but not transiting through it.

One possible way to address those is with just a P-Asserter value, and not bother to sign it - under the rationale that if you're not worried about malicious behavior or MitM or whatever, an asserter identifier is sufficient to determine scope, and troubleshoot and such.  But I'm guessing that certain provider domains may be more believable by some folks based on their size or brand reputation, and that those high-profile providers would want to protect their brand from being used/abused by others.  But it's just a guess.

Sort of, yes.  The idea for adding a P-Asserter id actually started before the idea of signing it - some of my customers were running into issues with PAI where troubleshooting it was painful in big peering arrangements (they weren't purposefully fraudulent, just wrong).  Then I was having an off-line discussion with some folks on this mailing list regarding 4474 Identity, and someone mentioned that PAI was very popular and that some providers will think PAI is good enough for identity.  So then we got into a discussion of why PAI will fail, and I suggested we just sign it, instead of From, and so yes that's the genesis of the draft.

But no I don't mean it for the "Internet", because it won't work right for all use cases/scenarios, and only applies for PAI.

Yup.  I should add that in far more detail.

Well, it certainly has a "better" chance.  I mean we *know* 4474 won't survive *any* SBC, purely by definition of what an SBC does to be an SBC.  I *know* this draft will survive *some* deployed SBCs.  So it's a "better" chance.  How many it can survive across I don't know.  For example I do know of deployed SBC's even this PASS mechanism won't survive.  (and I'm not talking about particular vendors - I know some providers do modify the PAI)

I'm guessing it also has a better chance of surviving more b2bua's in general (not just SBC's) than 4474 would.

But there's no doubt it's a gamble.  I'm just trying to make the odds as good as possible while still having some payback.

Huh?  It doesn't need to be stripped on leaving nor entering the Enterprise.  You lost me.

Hi Dale,

the context-id solves this use case

in the draft: 
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-loreto-sipping-context-id-requirements-00.txt
I have described how the context-id can solve the problem to "correlate 
the INVITE,
SUBSCRIBE request and recall INVITE in SIP Call completion scenario"

Hi Adam,

this is the paragraph we are talking about (in Section 8):

    The situation with 'multipart/related' is similar.  Per [RFC2387], a
    UA processing a 'multipart/related' body processes it as a compound
    object ignoring the disposition types of the body parts within it.
    However, UAs that do not understand 'multipart/related' will treat it
    as 'multipart/mixed'.  These UAs will not be able to process the body
    as a compound object.  Instead, they will process the body parts
    according to their disposition type.

What you are asking for is not to ignore the disposition types of the 
body parts within the multipart/related. If we go down that path, we 
will need to describe how multipart/related will be different from 
multipart/mixed. That is, we would need to clarify what we mean by 
"processing the body as a compound object" if the body parts are still 
processed per their respective disposition types, as if they were in a 
multipart/mixed instead of in a multipart/related.

Following the "propose text" principle, could you please edit the 
paragraph above so that we have a concrete proposal on how to describe 
the processing of multipart/related bodies and how it would differ from 
the processing of multipart/mixed bodies?

Thanks,

Gonzalo

If that's not the intention, then I had mistaken the scope of 
applicability to imply that the asserter identity would be stripped upon 
leaving an administrative domain, unless the domain it was going to was 
part of a federation formed by specific business arrangements regarding 
identity.

Given that such isn't the case, the intention of the document is a bit 
clearer. I'm still queasy at adding additional ways to do the same 
thing, even if the properties are somewhat different. But if anyone else 
thinks that's important, I'll let them fight that battle.

It's a bit wordy, but my first attempt at addressing the situation came 
out like this:

    The situation with 'multipart/related' is similar.  In [RFC2387],
    email clients processing a 'multipart/related' body are expected to
    processes it as a monolithic object, ignoring the disposition types
    of the body parts within it. Because SIP's use of
    Content-Disposition varies markedly from that of email, this
    constraint may not always make sense in SIP. Authors of SIP
    extensions making use of 'multipart/related' bodies are advised to
    explicitly address the handling of Content-Disposition on
    'multipart/related' body parts.  Authors wishing to make use of
    'multipart/related' bodies should keep in mind that UAs that do not
    understand 'multipart/related' will treat it as 'multipart/mixed',
    including the handling of Content-Disposition headers on body parts.

Adam,

Its pretty unsatisfying to end up with the manner of processing C-D 
varying from one use of multipart/related to another. This seems like 
the kind of thing that one would like to implement *once*.

If it is important to take C-D into account when processing 
multipart/related, can we define exactly *how* it should be taken into 
account? Does it supercede that of the container? Does it get merged 
with that of the container? Does it get merged (in a well defined way) 
with some default that the application is expected to provide for each part?

	Thanks,
	Paul

   the context-id solves this use case

   in the draft: 
   http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-loreto-sipping-context-id-requirements-00.txt
   I have described how the context-id can solve the problem to "correlate 
   the INVITE,
   SUBSCRIBE request and recall INVITE in SIP Call completion scenario"

We've discussed context-id in the design committee, and we've also
discussed having the SUBSCRIBE provide the Call-Id (or from-tag) of
the INVITE, which for our purposes is very similar to context-id.
Unfortunately, neither proposal works well in the "call completion"
context, for several reasons:

The vast majority of INVITEs will never be subject to call-completion,
and there is no way to predict in advance which ones will.  Thus, for
efficiency's sake, providers don't want to attach to each INVITE an
additional context-id.

One would hope to avoid the first problem by using the Call-Id or
from-tag of the INVITE as its context-id, but in practice, many calls
pass through SBCs which modify both of those.

In addition, for truly wide-scale use, we would have to get the
operators of SBCs to configure them to propagate the context-id, which
cannot be done immediately.

   What if a Target-Dialog header was added to Subscribe by one of the UA?
   Will the SBC modify the Call-Id in this header to match the call-id
   between SBC and the other UA.

That is a clever idea, although I'm nervous about overloading
Target-Dialog like that.

An SBC might not process Target-Dialog as well as we would want,
because the INVITE dialog would be terminated before the SUBSCRIBE
arrives, and the SBC may have forgotten about the Call-Id translation.

Keith,

I understand that some service providers expect PAI to identify the
charged user, so accepting any PAI value outside the legitimate range of
the authenticated entity from which the request is received (e.g.,
authenticated at the IPSEC or TLS level) causes them grief. Hence,
considering an enterprise network to be part of their trust domain is
problematic for these service providers. In my opinion, the From URI is
more likely to pass through unchanged than the PAI. But perhaps the best
chance of success is to place the e2e-authenticated identity in some
other header field.

John

I agree that it is unreasonable to expect middleboxes to remember dialog 
ids and be able to translate them, after the dialog has ended.

But after listening to all of these problems, I wonder if it might be 
necessary to expect SBCs to do *something* that they might not currently 
do. And just recognize that this won't work until the SBCs are updated. 
In the end we can't work around all the damage SBCs do - they have some 
responsibility.

	Thanks,
	Paul

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Addressing Record-Route issues in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : T. Froment, C. Lebel
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-record-route-fix-03.txt
	Pages           : 26
	Date            : 2008-07-11

A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is to
set a Record-Route header on initial requests in order to make
subsequent requests pass through it.  This header contains a SIP
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) indicating where and how the
subsequent requests should be sent to reach the proxy.  Like any SIP
URI, it can contain sip or sips schemes, IPV4 or IPV6 addresses, and
URI parameters that could influence the routing like different
transport parameters (UDP, TCP, SCTP...), or a compression indication
like "comp=sigcomp".  When a proxy has to change some of those
parameters between its incoming and outgoing interfaces (multi-homed
proxies, transport protocol switching, sip to sips or IPV4 to IPV6
scenarios...), the question arises on what should be put in Record-
Route header(s).  It is just not possible to make one header having
the characteristics of both sides at the same time.  This document
aims to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified on
this topic; it formally recommends the use of the double Record-Route
technique as an alternative to the current RFC3261 text, which
describes only a Record-Route rewriting solution.

P-Original-From?

Actually, that would work pretty well -- if we add "P-Original-Call-Id," 
"P-Original-CSeq," "P-Original-Contact," and "P-Original-Identity," we 
could use RFC 4474 with just minor modification.

Or, even better, we could do away with P-Original-* headers altogether, 
and put the relevant header fields (including Identity) in an 
application/sipfrag body part. Then, you could use a normal RFC4474 
identity service, and add a security mangler to make the signature SBC-safe.

Or, we could put the "original-From" in From, the "original-To" in To, etc.

[JRE] I was thinking more of the proposal in the Fischer draft.

[JRE] It depends what we are trying to achieve. The Fischer draft is
aimed mainly at providing some authentication of the source of the
fingerprint of the certificate used to secure the media, rather than a
more general integrity protection of all these various bits of a SIP
request in general.

Therein lies the conundrum with intermediate manglers like B2BUA's
and mailing lists managers, etc. On the one hand, you can sign very little
and be far more successful at surviving the mangler. However, that's buying
you very, very little since things that the manglers mangle are the very 
things
that you want to protect. So why bother.

An alternate approach is "you break it, you own it". That is, if you must
break the signature, all you can do is resign it and hope that your own
reputation is enough to convince the called party to accept the call. Yes,
this is messy and unsatisfying at many levels and leaves many unanswered
questions. But fundamentally what people are asking for here is impossible
if you insist on b2bua manglers.

Lastly, if you want e2e security the conversation needs to be... e2e. Be it
straight over the top of the internet, through a tunnel -- however you can
route opaque packets to and from the two ends -- that is the only way to
have any both security as well as robustness. If we'd just get over that,
our heads would eventually stop hurting from repeatedly bashing them
up against this brick wall.

Yes! I was trying to put together something explaining this, but never 
could make it concise enough. Your explanation is perfect.

The way to get identity through B2BUAs is to have them *be* back-to-back 
USER AGENTS. They demonstrate to a 4474 signer (which may be colocated 
with the B2BUA) that they are authentic agents of the signer's domain, 
authorized to assert the identity in the "From" header field, and all 
the 4474 goo can be added just fine.

It is the conundrum for the entire Internet -- TCP 'protocol 
scrubbers' exist, TCP options get dropped, DSCP bits get changed,
ECN bits are mangled, and Router Alert Option gets dropped.

Such is the reality.  I wish it weren't the reality, too.

   But after listening to all of these problems, I wonder if it might be 
   necessary to expect SBCs to do *something* that they might not currently 
   do. And just recognize that this won't work until the SBCs are updated. 
   In the end we can't work around all the damage SBCs do - they have some 
   responsibility.

Emotionally I agree with your position, but as a practical matter, we
want to have call-completion work without any change in the transit
networks (even though the transit networks are not truly
SIP-compliant).

Yet IPsec and TLS still work most of the time. Sticking a b2bua into
a stream is fundamentally different than routers and scrubbers, etc. Their
job is to change the very things you want to protect. Either you get to the
"break it/own it" or tunnel it across manglers. Anything else is eating
caking and having it to.

Has any one proposed tunneling SIP in SIP? Ie, the manglers get to
set up their rendezvous ("because they simply must") and then the
ends get to set up theirs? This is one way the real world routes around
damage too.

So... are groups within TSV proposing new extension header fields to 
carry things like "orginal diffserv codepoint" with the hope that TCP 
protocol scrubbers won't mess them up?

Yes, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gurbani-sip-sipsec-01.  But
that only gives encrypted SIP signaling end-to-end -- it does not 
cause a firewall or SBC or B2BUA to open its permission for the
RTP flow.  A firewall or SBC will only open permissions for a 
flow it knows about: that is their primary purpose.

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3168#section-8

   This section considers the issues when a router is operating,
   possibly maliciously, to modify either of the bits in the ECN field.
   We note that in IPv4, the IP header is protected from bit errors by a
   header checksum;  this is not the case in IPv6.  Thus for IPv6 the
   ECN field can be accidentally modified by bit errors on links or in
   routers without being detected by an IP header checksum.

   By tampering with the bits in the ECN field, an adversary (or a
   broken router) could do one or more of the following: falsely report
   congestion, disable ECN-Capability for an individual packet, erase
   the ECN congestion indication, or falsely indicate ECN-Capability.
   Section 18 systematically examines the various cases by which the ECN
   field could be modified.  The important criterion considered in
   determining the consequences of such modifications is whether it is
   likely to lead to poorer behavior in any dimension (throughput,
   delay, fairness or functionality) than if a router were to drop a
   packet.

Paul is 100% correct -- if we limit any future protocol extensions to 
what will work through unmodified SBCs as they exist today, then we 
don't need to meet in Dublin. We're done. Shut the working group down 
and send everyone home. Dean and Keith, please be sure to turn the 
lights off on the way out.

Let's not the SBC tail wag the SIP dog to death.

Maybe new drafts should have an SBC behavior section which should call
out how the SBC should handle messages, similar to existing RFCs/drafts
which call out how UAC & UAS should handle messages.

has representatives speaking in the forum regularly) are pretty well 
equipped to do something new that might be required, without a lot of 
hassle.

Well, you could use SIP to establish a TLS "media session" e2e (using 
comedia). Then you could put another SIP session through it.

Ok, so we're already half way there. The other half is to use TCP or
whatever other means to get the media through. Sneer if you like, but
millions of skype users can't be wrong. If that's what it takes to route
around firewalls, then that's what it takes.  The fat lady has pretty much
sung on this security vs. new and kewl issue, and the firewall owners
have pretty much said that if you're willing to go through the TCP hoops
for media, we're willing to ignore that you're bypassing policy. Stupid,
I know, but that's manifestly what we have to work with.

          Mike

Yes, the authors of RFC 3168 analyze what happens when a router is 
acting outside of specification, potentially with malice. But is TSV 
actively engaged in specifying how to duplicate information in a 
different part of the message in the hope that these non-conformant, 
potentially malicious intermediaries won't find it?

No, they aren't. Because that would be patently ridiculous. Recognizing 
the potential for an attack doesn't necessarily force the definition of 
comically[1] ill-conceived and easily defeated countermeasures.

Assume the draft on the table is published and implemented. How long 
before someone decides that their SBC "needs" to modify the 
"P-Original-To" header field? And when they do, will we just define 
another header field to squirrel away yet another copy of this 
information? (Should we go ahead and define "P-Original-P-Original-To" 
right now?)

/a


[1] I'm not using this word lightly -- when I presented the proposed 
solution of "signing P-Asserted-Identity" to a room full of engineers 
familiar with the SIP protocol, they broke out in spontaneous laughter. 
Without the frog-boiling that led us here as a working group, this idea 
is clearly humorous.

This implies I'm trying to hide/tunnel the information from intermediaries to get around their policies.  I'm not.

SBC's (and others) modify the From/To URI for a bunch of reasons.  One of those reasons is relationship hiding, and for any such policy there is clearly no point in trying to avoid/bypass it, as they'll just go delete or modify any new headers as you point out.  There is nothing we can do for such cases, imho.

But for a lot of cases they're not modifying To/From for that reason - they're modifying it to either "fix" them for specific interop reasons, or to hide topology (ie, when it contains IP Addresses or hostnames).  Those are the cases I'm trying to get the information through.

Hello,

There are times reality sucks..Hadriel is just giving you reality. 

Or better said, growing up my Irish born father told me many a times to
have some common sense and stop acting like a bloody American.

See you all in Dublin,

Martin

This implies I'm trying to hide/tunnel the information from
intermediaries to get around their policies.  I'm not.

SBC's (and others) modify the From/To URI for a bunch of reasons.  One
of those reasons is relationship hiding, and for any such policy there
is clearly no point in trying to avoid/bypass it, as they'll just go
delete or modify any new headers as you point out.  There is nothing we
can do for such cases, imho.

But for a lot of cases they're not modifying To/From for that reason -
they're modifying it to either "fix" them for specific interop reasons,
or to hide topology (ie, when it contains IP Addresses or hostnames).
Those are the cases I'm trying to get the information through.

That would work if and only if the B2BUA owned a cert of the same domain as the From they changed it to.  That is actually not the case in practice, even when the From is an E.164.  It would also not work if the From was not an E.164, since they can't go changing sip:adam@nostrum.com to sip:adam@garden.eden.com, for example.

So the question is: what is it that you really want to protect?  Is it literally the To/From/Call-id/etc. headers; or is it the source AoR, target AoR, and some additional info to prevent replay?

My belief is the latter.  Using the To/From/Call-id/etc. in 4474 was essentially a convenience, because the assumption was the info is already in those headers so one might as well reuse them for 4474's purpose.  But for some deployment scenarios those headers get changed - not because the changers *want* to hide the source/target AoR and anti-replay info, but for other reasons generally.  So I'm proposing creating specific headers to contain the same type of info.

no, but garden.eden.com could  could sign an identity header with a  
From: of adam@nostrum.com.

Would a recipient trust it?  Why would you trust anything that was  
mangled by a B2BUA in the first place? If you trust the operator of  
the B2BUA, then trusting the re-signed identity seems just as  
reasonable. The good news is that this lets people who DON'T trust the  
operator of the re-signing B2BUA know that the call has been mangled.

Not according to 4474.  The cert domain and From domain must match.

Hi,

I agree with Paul that having a common way for handling 
multipart/related would be good.

In any case, if we decided to use the disposition types of the body 
parts in a multipart/related instead of ignoring them, we would need to 
understand what would be the difference between:

- a multipart/mixed where body parts are treated according to their 
disposition types, and

- a multipart/related where body parts would also be treated according 
to their disposition types.

If we do not explicitly explain what the difference in processing is, 
implementers are going to be confused.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP
	Author(s)       : M. Munakata, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-02.txt
	Pages           : 10
	Date            : 2008-07-14

This document defines a best current practice for a user agent to
generate an anonymous SIP message by utilizing mechanisms such as
GRUU and TURN without the need for a privacy service defined in RFC
3323.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-02.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP at:
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/

DY> Just to add to what Hadriel said, one of the additional arguments  
*for* an SBC that I've had given to me by different vendors at various  
shows is that they can "normalize" SIP and make SIP interoperability  
actually work between different vendors.  The SBC understands how  
exactly Vendor X speaks SIP and how exactly Vendor Y speaks SIP and  
can then enable the interconnection/interoperability.  So the reality  
is that there are SBCs out there that view as part of their function  
to "fix" SIP so that it can be interoperable.  In doing this "fixing",  
one can expect that the SBCs would be changing headers.

Dan

	Title           : Domain Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : V. Gurbani, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-domain-certs-01.txt
	Pages           : 17
	Date            : 2008-07-14

This document describes how to interpret certain information in a
X.509 PKIX-compliant certificate used in a Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.  More
specifically, it describes how to find the right identity for
authentication in such certificates and how to use it for SIP domain
authentication.

	Title           : Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : R. Mahy, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-11.txt
	Pages           : 20
	Date            : 2008-07-14

This document enables a pair of communicating proxies to reuse a
congestion-controlled connection between themselves for sending
requests in the forward and backwards direction.  Because the
connection is essentially aliased for requests going in the backwards
direction, reuse is predicated upon both the communicating endpoints
authenticating themselves using X.509 certificates through TLS.  For
this reason, we only consider connection reuse for TLS over TCP and
TLS over SCTP.  A single connection should not be reused for the TCP
or SCTP transport between two peers, and this document provides
insight into why this is the case.  As a remedy, it suggests using
two TCP connections (or two SCTP associations), each opened pro-
actively towards the recipient by the sender.  Finally, this document
also provides guidelines on connection reuse and virtual SIP servers
and the interaction of connection reuse and DNS SRV lookups in SIP.

Folks: Scott and I have just released new versions of
domain-certs (-01) and sip-eku (-02).

Regarding sip-eku, Paul Hoffman from the PKIX WG has advised
us that we should probably NOT use EKU to indicate that the party
associated with this public key is an authorized SIP proxy for
the domain named in the certificate.  Instead, it has been
suggested that it will be cleaner to use a actual extension that
goes into the "extensions" field at the end of TBSCertificate
sequence.

Scott and I will be meeting Paul and others from the PKIX WG
to sort this out during the DUB IETF.  The changes that result
from this will be minor from the editing point of view, so we
will expeditiously get a new version out as soon as we agree
to the semantics.

In the meantime, the new versions of the drafts can be obtained
from:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-domain-certs-01.txt
and
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-eku-02.txt

Thanks,

Folks: Rohan, Brett and I have updated connect-reuse (-11).

The main changes are editorial in nature, stemming from post-
WGLC review and WG-chair review in preparation for moving this
work forward.  No technical changes have been made.

[SIP Forum Chair Hat On]

This is a sad state of affairs, if we have to break SIP to make it  
work for broken implementations.

I can see this kind of work going on outside the IETF, but it seems  
out of place to hack Internet protocols willy-nilly to make them work  
for either non-Internet deployments or to interoperate with obsolete  
or broken implementations.

Well...

This was WGLC, and you did get your comment in before the WGLC closed.

If the draft isn't right, its better to fix it now than later.

Like a lot of things, it seems that they only get noticed by a small 
number of people until it is almost "too late".

Well, the handling parameter wasn't invented for sip. So presumably we 
should try to stick with its intended definition if we can. Assuming we 
knew what that was.

ISTM that if a part has handling=optional, and you choose not to handle 
it, then you won't notice the handling parameter of any enclosed parts. 
But that is an ISTM, not a normative reference.

IMO this is a huge problem with all Accept-* headers. There is a fairly 
good chance that the 415 will only list those supported in a particular 
context. Consider for instance a case where a proxy for an AOR routes 
SUBSCRIBE requests for presence to one UA, and INVITE requests to a 
different UA. Those two UAs will most likely support different content 
types.

Even within a single UA there may be routing to different "applications" 
and that may result in different indications of what is accepted.

One might argue that this only makes sense within a dialog, but there 
are plenty of examples where the dialog is the wrong scope for this. I 
don't know a good answer here, but I expect that in practice the 415 may 
only reflect "this is what I can support here and now in this context."

This is just the tip of an iceberg. The iceberg is the meaning of "handle".

IMO, "handle" has to mean "process in a way compliant according to the 
specifications for this C-T and C-D in the current context. (Which 
includes the current message type and the processing of any containing 
body parts, referencing headers, etc., as well as the role (UAC, UAS, 
proxy, ...) of the processor.) In many cases, "ignore" may be a valid 
form of processing.

The specification of C-D states that the default for the handling 
parameter is "handling=required", so omitting it solves nothing.

Goes back to the meaning of "required".  I don't think it is 
tautological, but maybe it could be stated better. The goal here would 
be define the relationship between "handling=required" in the header to 
desired behavior in the recipient of the body part.

We discussed this a lot, and I thought we finally got something workable.

As I understand it, processing based on a reference and processing based 
on presence are more-or-less independent.

Assume for the moment that the type and disposition are understood. If 
there is some implied processing based on the type and disposition, then 
it will be done. If there is also a reference to it via CID from one or 
more headers (or other body parts), then those may also be performed 
based on the rules for those references. If the goal is to include a 
body part solely so that it can be referenced from elsewhere, then it 
ought to have a C-T/C-D that doesn't result in any unexpected processing.

If a part has handling=required, but is not understood, then references 
to it aren't going to work.

This is all pretty hard to explain. Expecially if you include references 
from other body parts. After listening to Adam, I suspect that maybe 
reference between body parts should be within a multipart/related, which 
will get us into the other discussion of C-D with multipart/related. But 
I think there are cases where multipart/related isn't appropriate.

Consider the following:

An INVITE that contains both sdp and a body part referenced by a Geoloc 
header. Those two parts aren't related to one another, so they go into a 
multipart/mixed in the INVITE. The reference is from the headers of the 
sip message to one of the body parts within the multipart/mixed.

Something similar could occur in a response to an INVITE as well, though 
probably not with geoloc. For instance there could be an Alert-Info 
header referencing a body part containing a picture of the callee.

Now suppose a REFER causes an INVITE that has such a response. And the 
entire response is returned in sipfrag in a NOTIFY to the referror. So 
then you have: A REFER with a body of type sipfrag. The body in turn 
contains a body of type multipart/mixed. The multipart/mixed contains an 
SDP part and an image part. The sip headers in the sipfrag reference the 
image part in the contained multipart/mixed.

Now *probably* the image part in the response to the invite would have 
handling=optional. Or it could have had handling=required if the callee 
felt strongly about presenting its image. I don't know what should 
happen to the INVITE if the image body part wasn't understood. Nor do I 
understand what should happen to the NOTIFY if the recipient doesn't 
understand the image.

But that part COULD be changed, if one adequately described other  
acceptance rules. One could potentially  also "compound @" so we have  
an @nostrum defined in the context of @eden. Something like a signed  
uunet route.

	I would say I don't know whether I should laugh or cry, but laughter  
is obviously much more fun. Seriously; how ridiculous do things need  
to get before we can no longer keep a straight face? (I gave up a  
while ago)

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS
	Author(s)       : J. Fischl, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework-02.txt
	Pages           : 33
	Date            : 2008-07-14

This document specifies how to use the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) to establish an Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
security context using the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
protocol.  It describes a mechanism of transporting a fingerprint
attribute in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) that identifies
the key that will be presented during the DTLS handshake.  The key
exchange travels along the media path as opposed to the signaling
path.  The SIP Identity mechanism can be used to protect the
integrity of the fingerprint attribute from modification by
intermediate proxies.

At least, once they notice them, they'll delete or modify them. Until 
then, the identity stuff will quite possibly get through them just fine 
(potentially in violation of intended policy). But that's neither here 
nor there, really; because, as you point out, the real issue is:

> But for a lot of cases they're not modifying To/From for that reason - they're modifying it to either "fix" them for specific interop reasons, or to hide topology (ie, when it contains IP Addresses or hostnames).  Those are the cases I'm trying to get the information through.

And they're doing this because some products have unilaterally taken the 
intended meaning of "To" and "From" and (intentionally or not) 
misinterpreted them.

Now, let's imagine a world in which we take on 
draft-kaplan-sip-asserter-identity as a working group item, and publish 
it as an RFC. Over then following several years, it sees a relatively 
high level of deployment. Are we to imagine that "P-Original-To" won't 
be hijacked by the same kinds of systems that currently hijack "To" to 
mean something other than it should? Sorry, I can't suspend my disbelief 
that far.

All you're doing is taking the next step in a losing battle -- even if 
the opponent is blithely unaware of the damage they are wreaking, it's 
still a battle and we're still going to lose.

Well sure, ALL of it COULD be changed. :)
(one could argue the P-Asserted draft is in fact proposing such changes)

The only point was it won't work as defined today.

Of you could express it cryptographically. Well-Known-Root signs @eden; 
@eden signs @nostrum. Recipient can examine the cert and determine 
whether they trust the chain.

On this last part, message/sipfrag is not a multipart so I don't think 
the rules in the body-handling draft really applies to how the referrer 
processes this NOTIFY. The sipfrag may include a body which may be a 
multipart but the entire sipfrag will be transported as an opaque 
non-multipart in the NOTIFY. So I would tend to think that this draft is 
irrelevant as far as interpreting sipfrags is concerned.

Yup, that's possible.  It's possible for anything we do, no doubt.  But there is a difference: we're starting with it being signed.  If it becomes popular and people start hijacking and mucking with it, the signature fails, and they will be introducing call failures or errors into a previously working deployed system.  Customers don't like to introduce failures into an already working deployed system (the Spice must flow).  Today if you try to do 4474 and it breaks, you're the one introducing errors into a working deployed system.

Yes, that's pretty much what I meant by "adequately described  
acceptance rules".

The question is how do you decide whether to trust @eden to sign  
@nostrum? There is no delegation tree like in ENUM, so it has to be  
done based on a trust relationship (possibly a contract) between you  
and @eden. That's what we'd have to describe to extend RFC 4474  
transitively.

How is P-Asserter breaking SIP??

The P-Asserter draft is an Informational one, for private use... just as P-Asserted-Identity was (rfc3325).  It's not asking for 4474 to be deprecated.

That would be ideal if the b2bua was in fact part of the same administrative
domain of course. However, the "you break it, you own it" scheme obviously
couldn't require such a thing. As in the case of this mailing list 
breaking DKIM
signatures, the IETF could resign as IETF leaving the From: (or p-a-i or 
eieio
...) the same. At that point there's no ex(-im?)plicit binding between 
the sig
and the From: domain, but that probably doesn't make much difference if my
domain has ietf.org whitelisted for, oh say, mailing list traffic.

Like I said, not entirely satisfying but throw in some local and reputation
based whitelisting and it seems like a pretty plausible scenario for SIP 
too.

You're right, it's a Really Big Mess.

There are several mistakes we've made again and again that got us  
where we are:

1) Writing specifications dramatically ahead of implementation  
experience.

2) Hacking up bits of our core protocol model to appease the adherents  
of strict interworking with legacy phone systems, and accepting broken  
requirements from the same.

3) Using MUST to describe "does" in explicative text, thereby  
preventing RFC 2119 language from being useful in tabular comparison  
of implementations to the specification or to other implementations.

4) Multiple ways of doing things, including a P-header appeasement  
thing vs a "standard" solution.

5) Failure to deprecate the specifications and pieces of specs that  
either don't work or don't get used.

6) Demanding "perfect" security in the specification, when we know  
quite well that nobody will implement the security features,  
especially if they're hard to build or operate.

6) Refusal to deprecate a whole lot of cruft and revise the version  
number of the protocol. Trying to negotiate backward compatibility for  
every design mistake we ever made is a nightmare. Let's at least find  
a way to make this a bounded problem.

6) Listening to me when I'm wrong.

6) Not listening to me when I'm right.

7) Trying to count our mistakes on our fingers while we're busy typing.

Can I make a suggestion to you, the chairs and the rest of the group? That
nothing be advanced in this area to PS until you have shown real and 
interoperable
versions that are deployed in real life situations? Not in the DS kind 
of rigor,
but at least _something_ that demonstrates that that this is a) not 
academic and
b) there's real community interest in deploying.

For DKIM, a small group of us (me, Murray from sendmail, Arvel from
Alt-n and others) kept on top of the spec and pushed out deployed code
sooner rather than later. This was a  huge help for both interoperability,
but much more importantly to test out to see where the real-life corner
cases are.

Do you mean this in the context of the P-Asserter draft, or for rfc4474?
I'm fine with that for the P-Asserter draft.  I have no interest in updating it if no one uses it.  I submitted it before implementing in order to get feedback on whether people thought it was meaningless/useless in value, or provided anything worthwhile; and if anything needed to be corrected or taken into account for the mechanism.

So far, though, it's mostly just been complaints about why anyone would need anything other than 4474.  Now if we could only have gotten such a real-world deployment experience requirement before moving 4474 to PS...

I mean with whatever it is that gets us closer to the day that there is
light at the end of a tunnel that could in principle lead us closer to the
shore of the quagmire that Dean so eloquently detailed.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : SIP SAML Profile and Binding
	Author(s)       : H. Tschofenig, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-saml-04.txt
	Pages           : 45
	Date            : 2008-07-14

This document specifies a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) profile
of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) as well as a SAML SIP
binding.  The defined SIP SAML Profile composes with the mechanisms
defined in the SIP Identity specification and satisfy requirements
presented in "Trait-based Authorization Requirements for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP)".

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-04.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP at:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional Event Notification
	Author(s)       : A. Niemi
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-03.txt
	Pages           : 24
	Date            : 2008-07-14

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables
receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP
user agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating,
refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and
periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures have a serious
deficiency in that they provide no tools to avoid replaying event
notifications that have already been received by a user agent.  This
memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to
condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed
since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition
is true, either the body of a resulting event notification or the
entire notification message is suppressed.

Hi All,

I am doing some robustness testing of my SIP stack/service. During this
I have encountered an issue and a bit doubtfull about the action.

Problem description: I injected an INVITE method with a C-style format
string error added in the request line. The message looks like

20080711 16:42:28 INVITE sip%999d:+33711428101@172.21.183.55 SIP/2.0

20080711 16:42:28 a=3Drtpmap:0 PCMA/8000

As per my understaning the call should have failed with 480 response and
time out. But to my astonishment, the call completed successfully with

=20



The discussed diagram is a success call w.r.t to my test bed. Can anyone
please explain this kind of behavior.

The starting point of the mistakes was tying any form of identity to the
transaction identity of the protocol. At least some of the problems
would not have existed if we had broken that link.

But that is way back in the fundamentals of the protocol design along
with the poor compatibility specification.

		Well, I hope the lack of comment means everybody's
happy, but to make sure...
	=09
		This is a WGLC for comments on
draft-ietf-geopriv-sip-lo-retransmission-00.txt
	=09
		This LC will expire August 1.
	=09
		If, in fact, everyone is happy with the current draft,
publication request will occur shortly on the heels of the Dublin
meeting and SIP can start moving again on  its Location Conveyance
draft.
	=09
		It would be _very helpful_ to everyone involved if we
could be pretty confident about whether everybody's happy or there are
still problems to work out long before we get to Dublin.
	=09
		To that end, please send an "I'm OK with this" note to
the list as soon as you've convinced yourself you are.
		If you're pretty sure you aren't, start a conversation
on-list ASAP.

Subject: [Sip] INVITE message error!!



Hi All,

I am doing some robustness testing of my SIP stack/service. During this
I have encountered an issue and a bit doubtfull about the action.

Problem description: I injected an INVITE method with a C-style format
string error added in the request line. The message looks like

20080711 16:42:28 INVITE sip%999d:+33711428101@172.21.183.55 SIP/2.0

As per my understaning the call should have failed with 480 response and
time out. But to my astonishment, the call completed successfully with

=20



The discussed diagram is a success call w.r.t to my test bed. Can anyone
please explain this kind of behavior.

There are implementations of 4474 around and were long before it  
became and RFC but ignoring that ...

I asked some folks on this thread a few years ago for an example of a  
real deployment where it would not be possible to use 4474 as long as  
the SBC implemented 4474. I'm still waiting for an example of where it  
actually is broken. Hadriel  hypothesized a type of situation where it  
could be broken. That was the case where service provider A passed  
call to B who passed call C and they were not using E.164 numbers but  
were using email style addresses and the one in the middle wanted to  
do media steering or restrict what codecs where allowed.

FYI -- some discussion on PKIX list about the sip-eku issue I
pointed out in my email yesterday.  It may be the case that
the use of EKU as we have it in sip-eku-02 is okay after all.

Scott and I will let the SIP WG know of the final outcome.
We will summarize discussion from PKIX list to the SIP WG list
as needed.

Thanks,

I think it is more appropriate to focus on the EKU text from 5280, 
vs. the KU text, since the proposal is to assign an EKU OID for this 
use of certs. Section 4.2.1.12 describes the EKU extension and gives 
examples. The examples include TLS server vs. client authentication, 
code signing, time stamping, and OCSP response signing.  These 
examples from 5280 illustrate using EKU to signal what type of entity 
holds the corresponding private key, and for what purpose that key is 
being used.

So, using an EKU to signal that the private key holder is a SIP proxy 
(e.g., vs. a SIP end entity) is clearly consistent with the examples 
cited in 5280. I think that using an EKU to signal that the DNS SAN 
in the cert is to be used to constrain the range of SIP IDs can be 
verified using the cert is not completely inappropriate either.

If the From is an E.164, then you're right transit providers can re-sign it anew, changing the From domain to their own.  There are several problems with this, though:
        a) It has a deployment problem; we'd need all intermediaries which change anything signed by 4474 to all support 4474 re-signing, for 4474 to be deployable.  Otherwise the signature will constantly fail.  If it constantly fails, no one will try to use it.  If no one tries to use it, the intermediaries have no reason to implement re-signing.  Ergo, Catch-22.
        b) It changes the From URI.  Of course many intermediaries already do that for other reasons, but it's not like we should *require* them to do it if the only reason they would need to is to re-sign a message.
        c) We shouldn't *want* to force the intermediaries to re-sign.  It just makes it hop-by-hop trust.  Unless of course you believe the things being changed by the intermediaries are such that they MUST NOT be changed by intermediaries for the purposes of identity, because they are inherent to the meaning/value of "Identity".  For some things I don't believe you or anyone really feel that - for example call-id and cseq.  The questionable one would be SDP.
        d) Re-signing is expensive; it's both validating the received one, and signing it again.  The transit provider business is about low cost.  So they'll just delete the identity headers rather than resign, if they even do anything.

Well, to be fair the one in the middle could have any number of reasons for changing things which would break the signature.  Call-id obfuscation, CSeq number re-writing due to various b2bua functions, changing SDP for transcoding or dtmf interworking, etc.  You or your company knows all the reasons as well as I do. :)

We had a large, long, and lengthy thread of discussion that I will try
to summarize.

So far, almost everybody who has voiced an opinions says we need to fix,
rather than deprecate, INFO.

Opinions on fixing it vary.

Most people seem to think we need a registry of INFO usages that will,
at the very least, give us a table of the existing usages and the RFCs
or other specs that define them.

The sticky point of discussion is a negotiation and discovery mechanism.
We've had on-list proposals for a strong mechanism based on the mode
used in RFC 3265.

Some folks think we need to do this, and others thing there's no reason
to bother since it is not likely to get implemented because just
inventing a non-standard INFO use is easier.

Is there a middle ground?


What if we were to:

1) Establish an INFO registry and register our existing usages, policy
either "first come, first served" or "Specification required".

2) Define an Info-type header field and register (in the regoistry of
#1) a value for each known Info usage. Fully-compliant implementations
would send an Info-type header field with the appropriate value in every
INFO message.

3) Require registration of an Info-type for each future usage into the
registry of #1 above.

4) Define an "Info-type not supported" error response message. This
handles the use case of a UAS that receives an INFO with an Info-type it
does not understand.

5) For Info-types for which discovery is required, use a standards-track
RFC to define a SIP extension and option tag, and use the usual
OPTIONS/Require negotiation mechanism for discovery. We might consider
revising each INFO-using RFC to define an appropriate option tag.

This lets people easily register INFO usages and a corresponding
Info-type tag. It lets nodes that don't understand an Info-type usage
reject the message (at the expense of whacking the dialog, which
arguably was already in need of whacking). And it provides a standard
(although heavy) mechanism for discovery and negotiation when those are
required.

I think the above addresses the major concerns, is reasonably
implementable, is reasonably operable, and requires the smallest
possible effort to document. It's also pretty much backward compatible.

My guess is that we would focus on "Standard-Track" INFO (e.g. # 5).

Of course, all others such vendor-specific INFO implementations can be added as a part of the above. For example, options can be built-in in the standard-track INFO to have those capabilities (e.g. #s 1, 2, 3, & 4) if one does not want to use the standardized one.

Its probably a little different from either of these existing policies.
Thats because it should only be applicable to *preexisting* usages.
We don't want new, yet to be deployed, usages registered in this way.
(We will probably have to use the honor system for determining which 
usages qualify.)

I think either this is a different registry, or else it is the same 
registry but a different class of entry.

I'm inclined to think it is a different registry because it is a 
different namespace. The namespace for (1) is mime-types, while for (2) 
it is a unique namespace of Info-types.

Revising the old usages is IMO counterproductive. They are what they are.

Its not even that bad. It only whacks the dialog if you put Requires in 
the dialog-establishing request. If you simply put it in the INFO 
itself, then the dialog doesn't get whacked.

Works for me. Its pretty much what I had in mind.

IMO the registry of existing usages is at least, if not more, important 
than standardizing future usages. It gets all the proprietary usages out 
in the light of day. That will provide a way to understand what sort of 
mess we have.

I'm proposing that new, yet-to-be-deployed INFO usages would be in the  
same registry. Only if they need a SIP Option Tag for negotiation  
would they need a standards-track RFC.

I do NOT want the SIP working group to live forever as the "INFO  
police". It just really doesn't matter that much what people put in an  
INFO as long as they don't hurt each other with conflicting usages.

That's not what I'm suggesting; it's NOT mime-types; it's Info-types  
in all cases. I'm saying we retroactively invent an Info-type for each  
documented existing usage. As people rev their old-use code, they  
would add the Info-type to their Info messages.

It might be OKAY to have a mime-type as an additional column in the  
registry, although that potentially leads us down an area of mime-type  
exclusion.

Do we also need a set of content-dispositions for each Info-type?

Let's say that you send a 4XX error response to an in-dialog INFO  
(because you don't understand the Info-type of the dialog). What does  
that do to the dialog?

Possible registry structure:

Usage-Name  Info-type MIME-Type              Content-Disposition   
Option-Tag Specification
----------  --------- ---------------------  -------------------   
---------  -------------
ISUP        ISUP      application/ISUP       N/A                  N/ 
A        RFC 3398
QSIG        QSIG      application/QSIG       N/A                  N/ 
A        RFC 4497
DTMF        DTMF      application/dtmf       N/A                  N/ 
A        N/A
DTMF Relay  DTMFrel   application/dtmf-relay N/A                  N/ 
A        draft-kaplan-sipping-dtmf-package-01
Snapshot    snapshot  image/jpeg             render                
snapshot   draft-ietf-sip-snapshot-00 (std track)


Here's a question: The ISUP docs use an outer multipart MIME type,  
with the application/whatever inside. What does it mean when you have  
an INFO containing multiple parts of mismatched types?

Depends on the 4XX.

404, 410, 416, 482, 483, and 485 destroy the dialog. 405, 480, 481, 489 
destroy the INVITE usage, which will usually destroy the dialog. Pretty 
much any other 4XX only impact the transaction.

See RFC 5057 for the details.

That's a good list. Someone should make sure to capture the above so  
that we can see how 4474 compares to any other solution that is  
capable of providing end to end secure assertion about who's phone a  
user is talking and collaborating with.

Just to be clear, I'm aware of lots of situations where the service  
provider A and C might want to do the extra things you mention but I  
am not aware of real deployments where service provider B needs to do  
the things beyond media steering and codec restriction. I'm happy to  
be educated.

So let's say you return the new 4xx response to an old-fashioned  
sender who doesn't understand the 4xx response. It gets treated as a  
400. This doesn't destroy the dialog or the dialog usage, but kills  
the INFO transaction.

I have no idea what that does to the sender's state, and I'm pretty  
sure the sender doesn't either. Can we live with that? I'd think it  
would be better if it destroyed the dialog usage, but AFAIK we have no  
way of specifying such behavior in a backward-compatible manner  
(unless we reuse 405, 480, 481, or 489). What do we know about real- 
world implementations treatment of these responses? Is everything RFC  
5057 compliant?

I should have chased down all the footnotes before I posted; as I 
mentioned in an earlier mail, 405 to INFO doesn't tear down the usage. 
In addition to that, 489 to an INFO isn't defined, and 5057 calls it 
reasonable to treat it as a 400. 480 and 481 are clearly the wrong 
answer. So there's not a reasonable way to leverage 5057 to make the 
usage fail when an INFO type isn't recognized.

However: I don't think we *want* the usage to fall down when an INFO 
fails. That was a key decision we took during the development of 5057.

That's why I asked "Can we live with that?"

Let's step through the use cases.

Alice is an INFO sender for DTMF. She's talking to a new voice mail  
system and starts sending it info-dtmf-relay. The VM doesn't  
understand, so it 4xxes the INFO. Is Alice better served by having the  
call drop or her DTMF attempt ignored? I suspect here that "ignore",  
with its potential of a UI indicator to Alice saying "My attempt to  
send info-dtmf-relay failed", is probably better than the call dropping.

How about the ISUP and QSIG use cases? I'm guessing they would fail  
typically not with the new 4xx, but with the 415 Unsupported as  
documented in RFC 3372.

So it looks like you've convinced me; it's better for the INFO failure  
to NOT drop the dialog or dialog usage.

Replace A or C or both to be an Enterprise, lather, rinse, repeat.
But there're also cases where even if A and C are providers, that B would want to transcode, strip or modify ISUP mime, and convert number formats; this seems especially true in international transit peering.  And they almost all seem to want to replace the call-id.

Dean,

It does no good to retroactively invent new info usages for the existing 
usages of INFO, because the implementations don't know about them. They 
figure out that it is *their* usage from context, which in practice ends 
up being content-type. (I suppose its *possible* that somebody overloads 
a c-t and discriminates on some other basis, but I strongly doubt it.)

But the new ones are going to discriminate on info-type, not 
content-type. At least I think so.

The only way you can force them all into the same namespace is by making 
all the new ones discriminate based on c-t.

Having two namespaces/registries does not require the sip wg to stay 
around as police. All we need to do is define the admission rules. A 
simple rule would be:
- the usage had to exist before date D1
- it must be added to the registry before date D2
- FCFS per C-T
Then on D2 that registry is permanently closed. That means that anybody 
with an existing usage needs to hurry to get it registered.

Or, we can forget about D2, and leave the registry open forever on a 
FCFS basis per C-T, with a proviso that only usages that were in 
existence prior to D1 are eligible. (But with no enforcement mechanism 
for that.)

Now that I think about it, maybe it can't even be FCFS per C-T. If it 
turns out that more than one usage uses the same C-T, then they can't 
interoperate, but presumably they still exist. I guess we would need to 
register them and note the conflict, as a warning to users. Hopefully 
this won't happen in practice.

I agree with Paul; these need to be different registries.

I also agree that inventing a new info framework will NOT make us the 
INFO police; quite the opposite. I think we make it easier to do vendor 
proprietary stuff (within a vendor namespace), and we can define the 
extension procedure such that the bar is lowered for things that folks 
want cross-vendor interop but don't want to go through the whole ietf 
process.

Frankly, I think the framework defined in Hadriels' draft is pretty 
barebones minimum - its basically a couple of headers which define what 
you support.

I do NOT want to use the existing option tags mechanism for this - or 
Require/Supported - it then requires standards track for these and we 
don't want that.

I've been informed that despite what I incorrectly thought, transitive  
signing doesn't require any modification to RFC 4474.

The 4474 spec requires that the subject of the cert used to sign  
correspond to the domain of the From. This is different from requiring  
that the common names match. So any SBC can re-sign anything at any  
time and break nothing, at the expense of some crypto work.

So, let's say adam@nostrum.com calls mat@cisco.com. Nostrum's AS might  
sign Adam's INVITE.  Cisco's SBC might verify the signature, munge the  
fields, mint itself a cert with a subject of "nostrum.com" (using its  
well-known Nostrum CA key to sign that cert!) , and then sign the  
request (replacing the Nostrum signature) using the new cert. Then mat@cisco.com 
  would verify Cisco's signature, and transitive trust is created. Of  
course this doesn't say anything about why Michael should trust that  
signature, although in this simplest case the rationale is obvious.  
But for a 3rd service provider "in the middle", it is much less obvious.

This is apparently how some people intended RFC 4474 to be used.  It's  
much looser cert-matching than we're specifying in draft-ietf-sip-certs.

Am I alone in being made nervous by this approach? It seems that I  
could, for example, use the well-known (hah!) softarmor CA cert to  
forge INVITES from our ADs, and unless you just happened to know that  
softarmor shouldn't be signing for Cisco and Neustar you're likely to  
believe me. After all, you believed the signature when I called you  
myself. Now, it does make it easier to track me down later . . . is  
that good enough?

Q.1912.5 and RFC 3204 specify what you are trying to do at the body
level rather than at the INFO transaction level.

Thus it sets the Content-Disposition header parameter handling to
"required". (Note that Q.1912.5 mandates this setting whereas RFC3398
does not constrain it, essentially leaving it to the implementor). The
response if this is set, and the receiving entity is not able to
understand it, is to send a 415. While this is defined in RFC 3204, it
does get a normative reference from RFC 3261 so I assume this parameter
and its handling is mandatory to implement for all RFC 3261
implementations, rather than specific to ISUP/QSIG.

415 destroys the transaction only.

Q.1912.5 doesn't seem to mandate anything useful with the 415 response
in any case.

In any case, if you are using INFO to encapsulate an ISUP message, I
would assume you had already encapsulated such a body in an INVITE
message earlier in the sequence, and therefore you would have performed
the Content-Disposition / 415 sequence on an INVITE transaction already.

Keith

In section 3 (Motivation) it states:

"In order for SDES and MIKEY to provide this
      security property, they require distribution of certificates to
      the endpoints that are signed by well known certificate
      authorities."
Why is this? For MIKEY, the certificate could be self-signed, and by
including the certificate in the MIKEY message within the SDP body, the
RFC 4474 signature will protect it in the same way as for DTLS-SRTP.

For additional information, this was originally targetted as an
essential correction, but we agreed at IETF#70 that it should instead we
progressed as a standalone BCP as it was not essential. 

It does not not directly update RFC 3261, and is currently not intended
to.

Keith

(As SIP WG co-chair)

I note that:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-02.txt

Has undergone substantial changes since the last version.

Please review the document and make some comments to the list - good,
bad or whatever.

I don't believe I have seen any list discussion since before IETF#71 and
this is chartered work.

Regards

Keith

The IESG has approved the following document:

- 'Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests in the Session Initiation Protocol 
   (SIP) '
   <draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt> as a Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working 
Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Cullen Jennings and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt

Technical Summary 

This document specifies a mechanism that allows a SIP User Agent 
Client (UAC) to request a SIP URI-list (Uniform Resource Identifier list)
service to send a SIP MESSAGE request to a set of destinations. The client
sends a SIP MESSAGE request that includes the payload along with the
URI-list to the MESSAGE URI-list service, which sends a similar MESSAGE
request to each of the URIs included in the list. 

Working Group Summary 

The document was originally produced by the SIPPING working group, but
was transferred to the SIP working group due to the need to define a new
option tag, in conformance with RFC 3427. There is consensus in the WG to
publish this document. 

Document Quality 

There is a strong requirement from OMA and 3GPP for a SIP solution in
this area. 

Personnel 

Keith Drage is the document shepherd for this document. 
Cullen Jennings is the responsible Area Director.

Note to RFC Editor
 
Page 10:
OLD:
 Failing to copy the From header field of the sender would
 prevent the recipient to get a hint of the sender's identity.

NEW:
 Failure to copy the From header field of the sender results
 in unacceptable security and privacy failures.

Page 11: add reference to RFC 3261
OLD:
  o  A MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD create a separate count for the
     CSeq header field of the outgoing MESSAGE request.

NEW:
  o  A MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD create a separate count for the
     CSeq header field [RFC3261] of the outgoing MESSAGE request.

Andreas/Joao

how is this new offering different than
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-saml-04.txt

which is a WG item within SIP and has been around for a while...

I'm not gleaning the delta from your new -00 offering and the 
existing WG item, making me question why the new ID was written.  I 
might have missed a key facet of this new ID not in the existing WG 
item, and am asking if you can explain the need for this second SAML in SIP ID?

Thanks

James

I've been informed that the above is also completely wrong. So I'm going 
to shut up until I can beat the truth out of somebody.

And we wonder why implementors have trouble with our specs!

This is a really good place to start bashing from. Thanks for going  =

through the pain it takes to put this together.

Everyone should take note that the second session has a RAI conflict
(with DRINKS) and think through where to put conversations so that
we minimize the pain caused by the necessary split of people.

I think I'd rather see the large, architectural questions,
INFO and Identity, moved into the conflict free spot and
put topics with a smaller constituency into the second session.

I also think people across the working group should chime in with what  =

they think
the three most important _DRAFTS_ to talk about, in person, at this  =

meeting are.
I strongly suspect there's a surprise or two that will come out of that.

I'll throw my own list in later (because I want to think awhile about  =

what's _not_
in the proposed agenda), but to help tune things early:

I do want to talk about 199.

I don't see why we should spend face time on sip-keep at this point.

I think we can get away without face time on record-route fix.
(its unlikely at this late stage that we'll find a crisis to work  =

through there).

I have received very little feedback on invfix, and I don't think
     we need to spend any in-meeting time on the essential
     corrections process itself. So, I propose we take that entire
     topic to the list and/or hallways. I'll take on pushing a few
     key folks to review the big recent changes to invfix and
     speak up that they've done so before we get to the meetings.

Everybody else: If you hold the token on any of the other drafts and  =

feel you can
  resolve any issues you currently have the same way, I strongly urge
  you to propose something similar for your time.

I do have a significant comment on this draft, because of decisions
in the final version if draft-ietf-sip-sips that fix some of the bugs
hightlihted in this draft (and remove a use case for double record route).

I believe those changes fix BUG 734 and BUG 735 as listed by Robert.

Since draft-ietf-sip-sips does NOT use double record routing
anymore (in fact, it prohibits mapping from sip to sips), references 
to this effect need to be removed from the document. Specifically:

- In section 1:
	- In first paragraph, delete ", sip to sips".
      - Please delete the fourth sub-bullet.

- Section 3.2: I believe the following sentence in the 4th paragraph
  shall be deleted: 
  "Then, this section speaks about record-route requirements
   when transiting from sips to non-sips.  It's not clear that the
   section doesn't apply to TLS to non-TLS transitions where SIPS is not
   involved (see [BUG734]).".
  Later in this section, you quote the following paragraph from RFC 3261/
  section 16.7 bullet 8:
  "If the proxy received the request over TLS, and sent it out over a
   non-TLS connection, the proxy MUST rewrite the URI in the Record-
   Route header field to be a SIPS URI".
  As per draft-ietf-sip-sips-08/Appendix B, this whole paragraph has 
  been deleted as a "Bug fix". So you should remove it from the text
  (and maybe refer to it's removal as per draft-ietf-sip-sips-08). 
  Furthermore, ther paragraph right after should thus be reworded as 
  follows:
   Indeed, [RFC3261] suggests rewriting the Record-Route header in
   responses.
  (i.e., everything starting with ", and mandates..." until the end of the 
  paragraph is deleted.
  I believe this means that BUG734 and BUG735 has been adressed by 
  draft-ietf-sip-sips-08 since mapping between sips and non-sips has been deprecated.

- In section 4, change the last sentence to "This recommendation 
  applies to all uses of Record-Route rewriting by proxies, including 
  transport protocol switching and multi-homed proxies."



I would like these changes do be done before WGLC.

Having looked at the agenda, I think we can do without the 2nd session. Wha=
t
I mean is that we can remove presentations from the 1st session that we
don't think need face time (Robert pointed at a couple) and move the ones
requiring face time from the 2nd session to the 1st.

I don't think we need 10 mins to bash the agenda. I also don't think we nee=
d
10mins for draft-ietf-sip-saml-04. We can limit face time to drafts that
have open issues to discuss that were not resolveable on the list.

Thanks,
Hisham

Well, I have to say I based the invfix and steps-to-draft times on  
Robert's request from last week, so I'm surprised but not unhappy  
about the suggestion to nuke them.

Keith and I discussed that. I suggested 5. He pointed out that for the  
last 10 meetings or so, every time we've said 5 we've used 15.

Here's the open issue with SAML. Are we actually going to do anything  
with it? The two people who seem to care about the draft have worked  
at it steadily. Does it have any meaning to the rest of us? Should we  
publish it? Maybe as experimental?

Hi,
 =

As I said earlier, I see no major issue with 199 at this point which would =
require face-to-face discussions. I could give a status update, but that wo=
uld only take about 5 minutes.
 =

I think we DO need to decided, based on Keith's requirement questions etc, =
how to move forward with keep.
 =

I also think two slots now give us a good opportunity to discuss (and decid=
e) what to do with INFO, so I really think we should use the two slots that=
 have been given to us. =

 =

Regards,
 =

Christer

This is a really good place to start bashing from. Thanks for going =

through the pain it takes to put this together.

Everyone should take note that the second session has a RAI conflict
(with DRINKS) and think through where to put conversations so that
we minimize the pain caused by the necessary split of people.

I think I'd rather see the large, architectural questions,
INFO and Identity, moved into the conflict free spot and
put topics with a smaller constituency into the second session.

I also think people across the working group should chime in with what =

they think
the three most important _DRAFTS_ to talk about, in person, at this =

meeting are.
I strongly suspect there's a surprise or two that will come out of that.

I'll throw my own list in later (because I want to think awhile about =

what's _not_
in the proposed agenda), but to help tune things early:

I do want to talk about 199.

I don't see why we should spend face time on sip-keep at this point.

I think we can get away without face time on record-route fix.
(its unlikely at this late stage that we'll find a crisis to work =

through there).

I have received very little feedback on invfix, and I don't think
     we need to spend any in-meeting time on the essential
     corrections process itself. So, I propose we take that entire
     topic to the list and/or hallways. I'll take on pushing a few
     key folks to review the big recent changes to invfix and
     speak up that they've done so before we get to the meetings.

Everybody else: If you hold the token on any of the other drafts and =

feel you can
  resolve any issues you currently have the same way, I strongly urge
  you to propose something similar for your time.

Christer,

The 2nd session conflits with DRINKS, therefore you will find that it may
well end up having all the unimportant topics discussed in it. I therefore
suggested cancelling that session compeletly. I really believe important
topics can be queezed into the one session.

Regards,
Hisham

<div>Christer,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The 2nd session conflits with DRINKS, therefore you will find that it =
may well end up having all the unimportant topics discussed in it. I theref=

My list is the same as John's, fwiw.
I'm also very surprised SIP can be scheduled in conflict with any other RAI WG, especially a brand new one. :(

All;

I have updated ua-privacy draft.
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ua-privacy-02.txt

Changes between -01 and -02 are as follows:

1) Incorporated the result at the last meeting

Depending on whether SIP-Identity is applied or not,
>From header can be set as anonymous@anonymous.invalid
or anonymous@{user's domain name}.

2) Modified the expression of "new mechanism"
   to "best current practice"

I use the expression "best current practice" in Abstract
and Introduction because SIP charter says it is BCP.
Is it better to use the term of "guideline" and proceed
the draft as informational?

3) Deleted the Requirement section

All the requirements seemed to be too obvious.
(UA MUST anonymize a SIP message by itself,
the backward compatibility MUST be secured.)

4) Deleted citations from RFC3323

Since this draft does not intend to replace RFC3323,
but defines UA-driven anonymization separately, it does
not have to include the same description with RFC3323.

5) Organized the text in Sec 4
   (Treatment of Privacy-Sensitive Information).

Overall treatment of privacy-sensitive information, and
how to obtaining functional anonymous URI and IP address
using GRUU and TURN are shown.

6) Resolved FFS items in Sec 5 (User Agent Behavior)

Added instructions to treat each SIP headers such as
Contact, From, and Via as well as SDP and host name.

The editors realized that the indication of anonymization
using this UA-driven privacy mechanism was not necessary.

At the last meeting, we discussed the privacy-sensitivity
of domain name in From header, and the result was that
domain name was not essential privacy information.

In that case, intermediaries do not add any privacy-sensitive
information that is essential, except for P-Asserted-Identity.
  (UA can request to delete the P-A-ID before it is forwarded
   to the other UA by using the existing privacy mechanism,
   Privacy:id.)
Therefore, UA does not have to request intermediaries not to
add any extra information to the already-anonymized message.


The editors believe that there is no remaining issues.

Thanks,

Mayumi

Despite any vagaries in Dean's calling notice - this is WGLC.

Hence we will consider this as a WGLC comment.

It would be useful if other members of the working group comment on this
comment to ensure the editor has some WG consensus to work from, as well
as reviewing the draft for their own WGLC comments.

Regards

Keith

Hi,

We are looking at doing alternate capabilities as part of
draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-09 using a new attribute
(sescap).=20

=20

Reading section 5.2 of the body-handling draft , I understand that I
cannot offer a multipart/alternative having two Content-Disposition :
session bodies both with content-type application/sdp. I can have one
'session' body with application/sdp and the other with
application/sdp-new which is not SDP for example.=20

Is that what section 5.2 says?

=20

Thanks

Roni Even

These are the slots we think we need to address the issues that have =
surfaced on the list, and where we believed face to face time would be =
beneficial, or where we as chairs need guidance on how to progress an =
item. In that respect the inclusion or exclusion of items is certainly =
discussable.
=20
For all you agenda replanners out there, here are some issues to take =
into account.
=20
1)    We have already missed one significant issue off the agenda which =
was the identity issue. Large number of drafts, large number of posts to =
the mailing list - that outqualifies most of the other items on the SIP =
WG list and in every other RAI WG without exception. If we gain an hour =
on agenda planning, then that item goes back in, or we fall back on our =
current plan of trying to have some discussion outside the main meeting.
=20
2)    The agenda bashing time is also for 1 slide questions on WG drafts =
outside the main agenda. For example, I believe we have to point out the =
current status change of domain certs and make sure everyone is OK with =
that. Also pointing out that 10 minutes is excessive hurts - there are =
other RAI groups that take longer than this on this item.
=20
3)    3 of the items are documents that have recently, or are currently, =
in WGLC. We want to get these out of the door with completion of open =
issues raised. If there are WGLC comments that would benefit from face =
to face time in addition to list discussion to complete those documents, =
then those documents will get agenda time. invfix already has one issue =
to raise. Am still waiting for editor feedback on body-handling. =
record-route-fix is still in WGLC with only one set of comments made so =
far - where are your comments?
=20
4)    SIP is one of the larger groups and therefore the mic queues are =
longer. If we have scheduled the right question it takes at least 10 =
minutes for all the people at the mic queue to have one go at making =
their point, and some of you want more than one go. Attempts at asking =
people to be more concise don't improve the situation. Therefore one =
appropriate question at the face-to-face meeting takes 10 minutes to =
discuss.
=20
5)    We didn't schedule the clash with DRINKS. We suffer from the =
problem that there are too many RAI groups, and some of them ask for =
more time than they need (and some of them get their requests in late!). =
People propose sets of groups that can meet in parallel, but seem unable =
to agree on the split. And then you want core meeting time for BOFs as =
well. SIP hasn't had time for a navel gazing agenda item for a long long =
time. It distresses me when SIP has thing it needs to discuss but =
cannot, and we see other groups scheduling an hour for an agenda item =
entitled "way forward" or 20 minutes for "remaining direction" without =
any list discussion or incoming drafts to back it up. I have no =
intention of asking to cancel the second SIP session. We'll move stuff =
from one session to the other if it is possible and the move helps =
people, but that is it.

	Having looked at the agenda, I think we can do without the 2nd session. =

the ones requiring face time from the 2nd session to the 1st.
	=20

		This is a really good place to start bashing from. Thanks for going =
through the pain it takes to put this together.
	=09
		Everyone should take note that the second session has a RAI conflict
		(with DRINKS) and think through where to put conversations so that
		we minimize the pain caused by the necessary split of people.
	=09
		I think I'd rather see the large, architectural questions,
		INFO and Identity, moved into the conflict free spot and
		put topics with a smaller constituency into the second session.
	=09
		I also think people across the working group should chime in with what =
they think
		the three most important _DRAFTS_ to talk about, in person, at this =
meeting are.
		I strongly suspect there's a surprise or two that will come out of =
that.
	=09
		I'll throw my own list in later (because I want to think awhile about =
what's _not_
		in the proposed agenda), but to help tune things early:
	=09
		I do want to talk about 199.
	=09
		I don't see why we should spend face time on sip-keep at this point.
	=09
		I think we can get away without face time on record-route fix.
		(its unlikely at this late stage that we'll find a crisis to work =
through there).
	=09
		I have received very little feedback on invfix, and I don't think
		   we need to spend any in-meeting time on the essential
		   corrections process itself. So, I propose we take that entire
		   topic to the list and/or hallways. I'll take on pushing a few
		   key folks to review the big recent changes to invfix and
		   speak up that they've done so before we get to the meetings.
	=09
		Everybody else: If you hold the token on any of the other drafts and =
feel you can
		 resolve any issues you currently have the same way, I strongly urge
		 you to propose something similar for your time.

[JRE] I would like to support what Keith says, in particular this last
point (5). Over recent years I have been in sessions of some RAI groups
that have finished early or had relatively large amounts of time for a
small number of topics, yet this never seems to be the case in SIP or
SIPPING, which seem to be time-constrained on a regular basis. Maybe
mailing list activity between meetings should be one of the criteria on
which WGs session durations are determined.

Nope, not your fault, nor anyone's - and I don't think anyone thinks or claimed it was.  But I think actually that the parallel groups suggested on the RAI mailing list had no dissenters; and regardless, it's really just unfair to make SIP conflict with anything in RAI.  But I'll take this topic to the RAI list.

Hi Robert,

I've been through this draft recently, and it broadly matches up to the
changes we have been using successfully for a while now (modulo some
implementation details).  I only have a few minor comments:

Figure 2:
This might be a minor typo, or I may have completely misunderstood the
draft.  Should the state labelled 'Completed' actually be labelled
'Accepted'?

8.4 para 7:
The first sentence is a little awkward.  It currently contains
   'the "Accepted" state, The client'

Obvious fixes are either
   'the "Accepted" state.  The client'
or
   'the "Accepted" state, the client'
but both end up with the sentence sounding a bit clumsy.

You could replace the entire sentence with something like this:
   When in either the "Calling" or "Proceeding" states a 2xx response is
   received, the client transaction MUST transition to the "Accepted"
   state, and Timer M MUST be started with a value of 64*T1. The 2xx
   response MUST be passed up to the TU.

Minor typos
===========
7.1 para 2:
"transisition" should be "transition"

7.3 para 1:
"any response SIP response" should be "any SIP response"

Figure 3:
"Timer B fired" should be "Timer B fires" (and used to be)

8.10 Timer M:
"retranmission" should be "retransmission"

Best regards,

Michael

I did not offer to remove steps-to-draft - we do need face time on that.

And I mentioned when I scheduled invfix that we could pull it if there  
were no comments before the meeting.

I also do not think we need to discuss the document during the meeting.
There are open issues but they are mostly technical in nature and I
don't expect a lot of feedback on these issues during a face-to-face
discussion with a 10 min slot. 

My impression at previous SIP meetings was that there is not enough time
for some discussions related to the overall direction of the work. Many
of the detailed discussions on drafts, where often only 5 folks know the
subject well enough or care about it enough to join the discussion, are
not really well-spent time given the larger number of folks in the
meeting room.

See the response Dean made, but we will come up with a more general post
from the chairs to the SIP list on what we expect to ask here.

Thanks, John.

This is, in large part, why I'd like to see SIP and SIPPING split up  
into more modular working groups. They're ALWAYS time constrained, and  
can never seem to focus on the right subset of their myriad tasks to  
make people happy,


But your post points out one important issue: a large, complex working  
group can pack a meeting agenda more completely with topics than can a  
narrowly-focused WG.

Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

If our goal is to build the most efficiently packed agendae, it's a  
good thing. If, however, our goal is to get issues thoroughly  
discussed and build solid consensus, I suggest it is not.

I'm reminded of the old management saw: "Be careful what you measure,  
because whatever is measured, improves according to the definition of  
that measurement."

SIP and SIPPING have been very effective at efficiently packing agenda  
time. We've even been pretty good at turning out pages of RFC.

Have we been effective at producing clear, simple, well-thought-out  
specifications that are easy to implement? I fear we don't score as  
well on that axis of measurement.

Okay, that makes sense. The only invfix comments I've seen so far have  
been typographical.

Does anybody have issues of substance to discuss face to face?

So here are the questions:

1) Are we getting anywhere, as a WG, with SAML?

2) Is there some other process we should be using that would be more  
effective, such as a) a design team leading to AD-sponsored individual  
or experimental draft, b) a dedicated working group on identity issues  
such as I have proposed?

3) Does the work NEED to be done at all in the IETF? Is there a  
constituency of implementation, or are we engaging in a purely  
academic exercise? Perhaps academic publication would be a more  
appropriate direction if we lack a constituency.

I have a specific suggestion on this topic.

I would like to see a late night education session:

Explain SAML

Explain how we use SAML with SIP

Show how the whole thing is used to solve a problem.

We might ask on the list who would attend such a session, but I suspect it
may be well attended, and after it, you may get some more feedback.

Brian

One of the reasons for us being slow with the document was the
dependency on SIP Identity and all the discussions around it during the
past year or so. SIP SAML is dependent on SIP identity, at least it was
up to the current version of the specification. 

Initially, I was hoping that these discussions would come to a
conclusion rather soon. As it turns out this wasn't the case. 

I am currently leaning towards avoiding the dependency with SIP Identity
(by using an independent header) and to ignore the discussions that
happen in SIP identity (SBC issues, E.164 numbers, etc.). 

>3) Does the work NEED to be done at all in the IETF?

Is the question focusing on "should this be done at all" or is the
question "is the IETF the right place for it"? 

> Is there 
>a constituency of implementation, or are we engaging in a 
>purely academic exercise?

There are implementations. Unfortunately from different versions of the
draft -- and the draft has changed over time.

Academic exercise: With the current state of deployment almost all SIP
security mechanisms are to some degree academic rather than enjoying
widespread deployment. 

When starting the work I obviously had a different picture of the next
steps of the SIP deployment in mind. I was hoping for a more end-to-end
usage of SIP for things other than voice. The document builds, with
regard to the functionality, on SIP Identity. If nobody wants SIP
Identity then I doubt that they are extremly interested in the advanced
version of SIP Identity. 

>Perhaps academic publication would 
>be a more appropriate direction if we lack a constituency.

This document is not more or less academic than the rest of the
documents in the SIP working group. I could list many things -- but I
better try to avoid that. Have already upset the GEOPRIV working group
today. 

If you are, however, asking whether the status of the document is
correct (currently PS) and whether it should probably experimental then
I am not so sure. 

Ciao
Hannes

was something lke "folks participating in the IETF should obtain their
technical knowledge themself"

Ideally, I would like to have one of the SAML authors todo the SAML
tutorial part to have the best possible expertise in the room. I,
however, don't know whether Jeff is attending this IETF meeting.

Alternatively, I could also imagine that a podcast would help to get
things explained quite well.

I think we did something like this a while ago - and it was attended 
well (maybe 20 or 30), so this idea has merit *BUT* needs to be 
before the SIP preso of SAML (making it Monday evening) to 
effectively tune the SIP preso with what was learned from the 
unofficial bof of SAML...

Is the SIP WG successfully moving the document along, or is it stuck  
in perpetual hold zone? Note that we've slipped the charter milestone  
for this draft several times. This is not the hallmark of good  
management.

Please tell me this doesn't mean you're inventing yet another identity  
mechanism for SAML . . .

The latter. Is the IETF the right place for this work?

Commercial or widely-deployed free implementations? Or lab

True. There is some pressure to stop putting effort into security  
mechanisms that are not being deployed.

That's a fair statement.

Well, the bar to publication as experimental is somewhat lower than  
PS. And if we don't expect near-term large-scale deployment,  
experimental may be exactly the right track to be on, as it's also a  
lot easier to change later once the implementation experience teaches  
us what we did wrong.

That's indeed true. 

If I ignore the ongoing SIP Identity discussions then I could finish the
document next week.

We are re-using the same way how SIP Identity signs the header fields. 
As such, if the raised issues with SBCs & co are real then the problems
would be the same.

Would it be reasonable to write the SAML doc against RFC 4474,  
documenting  the issues with RFC 4474 that you've raised, and then  
publish as experimental? Then if we ever get Identity revised, we can  
come back to the SAML document. And it gets one more thing off our  
plate for now.

And I'd still like to have a SAML tutorial.  We've had lunchtime  
tutorials on things like XCAP in the past that were well attended. All  
we need is a sponsor (asking people to pay for buffet lunch doesn't  
work) or a facility that is amenable to "brown bag" lunches in a  
conference room. And of course, we need somebody to organize and  
present said material . . .

Sure. That's essentially what we currently have in the document. 
Still, there is one unresolved issue we never really figured out how to
fix: "wrt RFC4474 'absoluteURI' in Identity-Info header field and
SIP-SAML implications"
http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/issue12

This let us wonder whether we should maybe go for a separate header.

I just dropped a mail to Jeff to see whether he is in Dublin. He
informed me that he hasn't received an OK from his boss yet. Let's see.
I can also give a tutorial myself but there is certainly a difference
between the person who wrote the SAML spec and the person who read it.

[JRE] Sounds reasonable. I know SAML is becoming important in the
applications world and it seems very likely that integration with SIP
will become important sometime in the future. However, I don't see the
drivers at present.

[JRE] I would try to attend such a session. One thing I am missing from
the draft is a set of real life use cases - I guess these were in RFC
4484, but something to link the two together would be good, i.e., how
exactly SIP/SAML would operate to solve each of these. Maybe it is just
me, but if you were to explain that in a tutorial it would be helpful.

In previous versions of the draft we had short descriptions of these
scenarios. 

We later removed them and put them in more detail in separate drafts
that also define the attributes. We did not update these drafts; they
all expired since we wanted to get the main spec done first before we
define attributes for the different scenarios.

I would also suggest the same list. And in particular, if we don't make 
a lot of progress on INFO and rfc4474, we have wasted our time. Those 
two IMHO should cover 75% of our meeting time. Having a bunch of 10 
minute presentations, each of which is on a topic that only three people 
care about, is not a good use of everyones time. Those two topics 
clearly have big impact on SIP as a whole and are of broad interest.

Having beaten a new version of the truth out of myself (assisted by  
questions from Hadriel and Cullen), I now know that what I meant to  
say was subtly but critically different:

-------
I've been informed that despite what I incorrectly thought,  
transitive  signing doesn't require any modification to RFC 4474.

The 4474 spec requires that the subject of the cert used to sign   
correspond to the domain of the From. This is different from  
requiring  that the common names match. So any SBC can re-sign  
anything at any  time and break nothing, at the expense of some crypto  
work.

So, let's say adam@nostrum.com calls mat@cisco.com. Nostrum's AS  
might  sign Adam's INVITE.  Cisco's SBC might verify the signature,  
munge the  fields, mint itself a cert with a subject of  
"nostrum.com" (using its  well-known Cisco CA key to sign that  
cert!) , and then sign the  request (replacing the Nostrum signature)  
using the new cert. Then mat@cisco.com  would verify Cisco's  
signature, and transitive trust is created. Of  course this doesn't  
say anything about why Michael should trust that  signature, although  
in this simplest case the rationale is obvious.  But for a 3rd service  
provider "in the middle", it is much less obvious.
------

I hastily typed "using its well known Nostrum CA key" instead of  
"using its well known Cisco CA key" in the last paragraph. I knew what  
I meant, I just typed the wrong word. Sorry.

This (as corrected) AFAIK cryptographically works. But it doesn't work  
any better than P-Asserted-Identity and TLS. It still lacks a  
reversible chain-of-trust that is visible to the end user.

I suppose the advantage is that, in the absence of an evil crypto- 
mangling SBC, you'd still get the benefit of end-to-end (or at least  
authentication server to verifier) RFC 4474, which MIGHT involve less  
transitive trust. But that doesn't seem too useful to me. I think it  
would be much better to just patch RFC 4474 to work through the SBC.

Another option would be to have each rewrite take the old request and  
wrap it in a a sipfrag body, then sign that request as part of the re- 
siging process. That way the final verifier would be able to work  
backwards through the chain of rewrites and verify each and every one  
of them. Of course, it one of the re-signing SBCs were more evil than  
usual, they'd still be able to lie to us about what was happening. But  
we'd be able to debug which SBC had "broken", from a diagnostic  
perspective.

Ah. I understand, I think. Check me:  SIP-SAML  doesn't work with RFC  
4474 because the Identity-Info header field of RFC 4474 has as its  
value a URI that points to a cert, and SIP-SMAL needs it to point to a  
SAML assertion.

So you're proposing a new header like "SAML-Info" that would have as  
its value a URI that points to a SAML assertion?

This could be done easily enough in an Experimental (although current  
3427 rules mean it would be P-SAML-Info, note that Keith has a draft  
out on revising 3427). It would certainly be easier than revising RFC  
4474.

If you went that route, you might note that the requirement for a  
separate header to reference the SAML assertion is an artifact of RFC  
4474, and that it could be done away with if a revision of RFC 4474  
allowed the Identity-Info header field to reference a SAML assertion.

Are we done with this now?

I don't disagree. In fact, I think you are absolutely right.

But while they are within the scope of our charter, neither INFO nor  
revision of RFC 4474 is a milestone on our charter. The other things  
we currently have on the agenda (except "keep") ARE milestone items.  
And we're LATE on most of them!

So either our charter is wrong, or we're out-of-scope in our interests.

I've previously tried to charter deliverables on both items and been  
shot down.

So what do you think we should do?

Like other protocols (see below), SIP needs to identify who injected 
a message into the SIP network.

We can't identify who injected a message using RFC4474.  As described
above, RFC4474 only identifies the most recent hop.  As you point out, 
the most recent hop is already known because the signaling is SIP-
over-TLS.


Identifying who injected a message into a network is the same problem
that USENET had for its posts and its cancels.  For a few years you
could assume the last host in the Path: header injected the message,
but of course people started forging the Path: header when they
injected a message, causing misdirection.  With USENET, you could
start asking your neighbors and eventually learn which host really
injected a certain USENET message.  But this was not an appealing
solution.  To authorize 3rd party cancels and identify who injected
cancels into USENET, various mechanisms to sign 'cancel' messages were 
born.  (Of course, USENET growth has tapered off, especially with 
the recent killing of alt.coffee by the New York Attorney General).

Coming back to protocols the IETF has standardized:

Email also benefits from identifying who injected a message into the
email network, even when the message traverses alias expanders,
mailing lists, or had footers inserted ("The contents of this message
are proprietary, burn it if you aren't supposed to receive it").  DKIM 
was born.

Transport protocols experience blocking and interference from
firewalls -- much like SBCs block and interfere with SIP and RTP.
Blocking ICMP is the most famous:  ICMP messages are blocked by
mis-configured firewalls (if you are an IETF person) or blocked by
properly-configured firewalls (if you are a non-IETF person).  
Noticing this reality, and the lack of success with TCP PMTUD 
black-hole discovery in many implementations, RFC4821 was born.


Yet SIP continues to stand apart.

In Dublin we have an opportunity to drink real beer.  We should
also tackle one of SIP's real problems:  identity.

So, which is it? Robert, are you aware of any specific issues? Or do  
you just have general concerns that we aren't getting closure on the  
list?

Dean,

So these milestone items we are late on, how many of them are late
because they are held up waiting for face-to-face discussion?

Dear James, all,

We apologise for not clearly stating the purpose of draft-pashalidis-sip-saml-00 and its key differences with draft-ietf-sip-saml-04.txt - we should have done that.

> [...] making me question why the new ID was written [...] [...] asking 
> if you can explain the need for this second SAML in SIP ID [...]

We wrote this ID having in mind the following main use case (among others).

The user wants to register with his SIP proxy, and is then put in contact with his IdP to perform authentication. 
The IdP provides authentication (as a service) but is not itself a SIP proxy. In general, the IdP provides authentication and user attributes to a multitude of service providers (including SIP proxies, webservers, and other types of service).

In other words, we would like to have a solution where the authentication is offloaded to an IdP, and where the relevant messages are SAML messages. We do not think that this competes or interferes with other user authentication mechanisms for SIP in any way. The reason why would like to have the messages encoded in SAML is because this is likely to maximise overall interoperability (and hence, positively affect overall user experience) since one can make the system work with any SAML-based IdP with limited effort. Having a SIP proxy accept a SAML authentication assertion means that we can have Single Sign-On *across* application domains (e.g. across HTTP and SIP) - this is what we would like to have. 

The main differences of draft-pashalidis-sip-saml-00 and draft-ietf-sip-saml-04.txt are as follows (according to our current, perhaps limited, understanding).

1. the former addresses the main use case above; the latter doesn't because it only allows the exchange of attributes (and "trait-based authorization" 
somehow conveys the message that the user's authentication status is NOT regarded as an attribute, i.e. explicitly excluded) 2. the former focuses on the SIP REGISTER method; the latter focuses on the SIP INVITE method 3. (as a side-effect of 2:) the former focuses of the provision of user authentication and attributes  to the SIP proxy of the *caller*; the latter focuses on the provision of attributes to the *callee* (or its SIP proxy) 4. the former specifies how to carry SAML over SIP, in a fashion that is similar to the way that HTTP has been specified to carry SAML. The advantage of SIP carrying SAML messages is that SIP UAs or SIP proxies do not need to implement two different transport protocols (SIP and HTTP), as is currently required by draft-ietf-sip-saml-04.txt. However, this could be easily added to the existing WG doc as well (at least we think so).

As to the why we submitted this draft, we wanted to support these activities which we think are important and fit to our current use of SIP and SAML. The current WG doc has a scope founded by rfc4474 and rfc4484 which does not cover all the use cases we'd like. Perhaps those are outside the scope of the WG, we think that's the discussion we'd like to have. 
The draft should be seen as input on this topic rather than competing or a statement of disagreement.

The other reason to submit this draft was to try and rekindle the discussion on the use of SAML in the context of SIP (it's recently been rekindled enough :)). We believe it is very important to have a consistent view on SSO and attribute exchange - a view that is consistent across platforms and, as much as possible, application domains.

Best Regards,
Andreas & Joao

I have specific issues which I will bring to the list before the  
meeting.
If I am the only person with issues to discuss, then any face time  
needed to close this can be with Christer in the hall.

This is part of why I want people to send in what the three _drafts_  
they think are the most important to talk about
(I re-emphasize draft here - its different from topics - we know we  
have some large issues to discuss, but we need
to give the editors, and frankly the reviewers, more insight into how  
much constituency each topic really has at
the moment).

You seem to be assuming that spending meeting time on them will make  
them less late. For the most part, that's only going to be true when  
there's some blocking discontent that an in-face meeting can resolve.  
Most of the stuff that you are expressing frustration over isn't in  
that state.

This is a false dichotomy, even if both statements turn out to be true.

I think, rather, that we have a lot of chartered items that just need  
to finish. They may need management to make sure review happens. They  
may need editors to punt them to somebody with more time. But the  
majority _aren't_ cross-community controversial. The in-the-room in- 
face meeting time needs to focus on things that are.

And quite often, the discussions requiring face time to resolve are  
exactly the kinds of things that result in new milestones and  
occasionally revised charters.

And yet, you're one of the first to complain that the WG/ IETF won't  
say NO. :)

(Lest someone read more into that than I intend, I am not trying to  
say no to the info or identity discussions.)

That's a good question. I'm having a hard time telling, since some  
(like SAML) don't seem to get a lot of list discussion either.


Let's take a look:

Jun 2007 Mechanism and guidelines for outbound connections to IESG
	-- Waiting on me

Jul 2007 Example security flows to WGLC
	-- Waiting on author, I think

Jul 2007 Location Conveyance with SIP to IESG
	-- Waiting on face-to-face, but in GEOPRIV

Aug 2007 Connection reuse mechanism to IESG
	-- Waiting on Keith

Sep 2007 Session Policies to IESG
	-- Waiting on Keith

Sep 2007 Example security flows to IESG
	-- Waiting on WGLC

Sep 2007 Using SAML for SIP to WGLC
	-- Not sure, maybe F2F?

Nov 2007 Requirements for media keying to IESG
	-- Waiting on me

Dec 2007 Extensions to SIP UA Profile Delivery Change Notification to  
IESG
	-- Hey, this one is done! I've just notified the secretariat. Yay!

Dec 2007 Using SAML for SIP to IESG
	-- Waiting on the WGLC, which may be waiting on F2F

Dec 2007 Extension for use in etags in conditional notification to IESG
	-- Waiting on the author. Somebody buy Aki a beer!

Dec 2007 Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to WGLC
	-- DEFINITELY waiting on F2F
	
Dec 2007 Establishment of secure media sessions using DTLS-SRTP to WGLC
	-- Waiting on author. Somebody buy EKR a babysitter!

Feb 2008 Identify requirements for test matrix to move SIP to Draft Std
	-- Waiting on F2F. On current agenda.

Feb 2008 Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to IESG
	-- Waiting on WGLC, which is waiting on F2F

Feb 2008 Revise charter
	-- Waiting on some decisions WRT Identity, which is probably F2F

Feb 2008 Establishment of secure media sessions using DTLS-SRTP to IESG
	-- Waiting on WGLC, which is waiting on author

Apr 2008 MIME body handling in SIP to IESG
	--  I'm not exactly sure.

Apr 2008 Essential corrections to RFC 3261 (1st batch) to IESG
	-- May or may not need F2F for invix

May 2008 Mechanisms for UA initiated privacy to WGLC
	-- Waiting for F2F

Jul 2008 Mechanisms for UA initiated privacy to IESG
	-- waiting for WGLC, which is waiting F2F

Aug 2008 Guidelines for double route recording to IESG
	-- In WGLC from July 16, may or may not need F2F

Sep 2008 X.509 Certificates for TLS use in SIP to IESG
	-- Waiting on Keith

Sep 2008 X.509 extended key usage for SIP to IESG
	-- Waiting on Keith

Sep 2008 Termination of early dialog prior to final response to WGLC
	-- Waiting on F2F

Nov 2008 Termination of early dialog prior to final response to IESG
	-- Waiting on WGLC, hence on F2F


So, it looks like we MAY require F2F time to advance the following:

SAML
Record-Route Fix?
invfix (Essential Corrections #1)?
Delivery of URI and Parameters to UAS Through Proxy
Requirements for Test matrix to Move to Draft
Revise Charter
Body Handling?
UA Initiated Privacy
Termination of Early Dialog (which isn't "late" yet)

The three "?" items (Record-Route, invfix, and Body Handling) are all  
in a WGLC cycle, so we don't know yet whether we he have critical F2F  
issues.

All the RAI groups that requested more than one session had their  
second session scheduled in conflict with another meeting. If anyone  
wants to tell me what groups should be closed to make more time for  
SIP, or what WG needs less time than they are currently getting, well  
that would be very useful input to me. Wishing there was more time is  
something the IESG is working on for IETF 73. We are trying to  
consider how to run meetings on Friday afternoon to provide more time.  
No final decisions have been made on this but you can expect to hear  
more about this in Dublin before any decisions get made.

>Jul 2007 Location Conveyance with SIP to IESG
>	-- Waiting on face-to-face, but in GEOPRIV

This one is interesting: I believe that it was not a good idea to have
the document in SIP when most of the controversial discussions happen in
GEOPRIV, i.e. the encoding wasn't been the problem --  the semantic was.


Spreading topics over different groups always makes the process more
complicated. 

Ciao
Hannes

PS: I also have to add that GEOPRIV clearly isn't the easiest group I
have dealt with. Hence, the delay is probably not so surprising.

This message is heavily crossposted. It is set to reply-to geopriv.
If you manually reply-to, please reply there.

There are some questions about how to best provide location for some  
applications. To date, the answer from GEOPRIV has been to use  
Presence as defined by SIMPLE and extended by GEOPRIV. (We've spent  
time arguing that in GEOPRIV more than once).

There are some new proposals, perhaps with new information, that push  
at that answer again, and in some cases, if they move forward, its not  
clear what the best venue to vet them in is. But we have to start  
somewhere, and the plan at the moment is to have a framing discussion  
in GEOPRIV.

Please review the following drafts, comment on the GEOPRIV list if you  
have an opinion, and plan to attend this section of the GEOPRIV  
meeting if you have an interest in how the conversation turns out.

Interesting coincidence with my insanely-cross-posted message of just

The key difference is that one merely requires an explanation of how 
things can be made to work; the other requires development of Another 
Way To Do The Same Thing, which (in protocols) is pretty much always a 
bad thing -- to be reasonably interoperable, implementations are forced 
to implement both (or all of) the defined mechanisms.

Publishing a document that describes how RFC4474 is expected to work
with SBCs would be very valuable.  Such a document is long overdue.

this is already being discussed on the ietf.ietf.org list -- btw, 
most like the idea, some want a specific measurement of success 
(silly them) - but are also in favor of the experiment.

yeah *but* there is thing about the ID that creates new SIP headers, 
and header parameters and a new response code... that makes it be in 
SIP, according to an existing RFC (4485 I think)

RFC 3427 placed location conveyance correctly in SIP.

There was a requirements exercise outside SIP, which preceded it, which
apparently some key players did not buy into. But not buying into the
requirements documents at the time they were written is apparently a
general GEOPRIV problem.

The semantic of the current GEOPRIV draft should have been written into
the location conveyance requirements draft before it was endorsed by the
working group that produced it. Then we would not have had this
continual reversal of opinion.

We seem to have too many people who think protocol design consists of
listing all the codepoint values they can think of, and then getting
IETF to endorse it. Use cases and requirements are a key part and the
charters of various RAI groups make clear provision for those drafts to
be written, and the work then passed over.

Having the second slot of a multi-slot WG meeting conflict with another WG is missing the point if the other WG it conflicts with is not a multi-slot one.  What it's doing then is penalizing the other WG.  For example, it is unfair to DRINKS that SIP conflicts with it - *DRINKS* didn't ask for two slots.

To reiterate what I've posted on the RAI mailing list, I grok the overlap problem, I think.  What I suggest, though, is that the overlap decision be implemented differently.  Instead of just forcing any RAI WG that needs 2 slots to have its second slot conflict, choose the conflicts based on topic relativity.  One proposal I posted was to break the groups into topic threads, such that different threads could conflict but not with the globally relevant groups (like SIP).

Let me put it a different way - what if the second slot for SIP conflicted with P2PSIP?

Given the time we have, this is how I think I'd like to see the SIP  
agenda look:

Tuesday

10 Agenda Bash, Status, Announcements, and Throwing of Folding  
Currency at Chairs
20 Steps to Draft Standard -- RJS
30 Delivery of Request URI and Parameters to UAS -- JDR?
30 Info Issues -- Dean? Hadriel?
30 Identity Issues -- Hadriel? Dan?


Thursday

30 UA Initiated Privacy -- Mayumi
20 199 -- Christer
10 Keepalive -- Christer



Does this make you noisemakers any happier than the original proposal?

However, adopting this sort of agenda requires some discussion with  
the ADs on how we think we might be able to formulate the identity  
problem in such a way that we might be able to make progress on it. It  
also requires "No Issues That Need Face To Face Time" from those other  
milestone drafts.

Keith and Cullen and I will try to get together Monday or Tuesday  
(assuming we can sort out the calendar) and if it works out, we'll be  
coming back to you with a revised agenda.

In the meantime, I'll start a separate thread on Identity and what we  
might want to accomplish.

We seem to have some disagreement as to whether we have any issues  
with SIP Identity, aka RFC 4474, which defines a certificate-based  
authentication service for authentication and partial integrity  
protection of SIP messages.

Some people seem to think the existing approach is complete and  
satisfies all the use cases that we believe to be real.

Others believe that the SBC re-signing use case is either bogus or  
requires too much crypto work on the SBC to be useful.

Others ask "Just exactly how is it you think RFC 4474 is supposed to  
work with a transit SBC that is in neither the originating nor  
terminating domain and that has no contractual trust agreement with  
either?"

I think we have SOME sort of problem, else we wouldn't have nearly a  
dozen related drafts kicking around the archives. But as I said, we  
lack universal agreement on the existence of such a problem, and we  
certainly lack consensus on use cases that illustrate the problem.

So it seems to me that before we launch into solutions to the problem  
(which the SIP working group isn't chartered to do), that we should  
develop a consensus on what the problem is and what requirements we  
would place on a solution.

Is this something we can do?

 From a "charter" perspective, I believe it is.

Our charter says:

-------------
Specific deliverables toward these goals include:

1. Mechanisms for secure expression of identity in requests and
responses.

2. Mechanism to securely request services delivery by non-terminal
elements ("end-to-middle").

3. Guidelines for use of existing security mechanisms such as TLS,
IPsec, and certificates.

4. Guidelines for the use of descriptive techniques such as SAML
(Security Association Markup Language) with SIP.

5. Draft standard versions of SIP and critical supporting
specifications.
--------------

RFC 4474 certainly does nothing for identity in responses, so it  
doesn't meet the requirement of our charter. so work on responses is  
clearly in the scope of the charter. And note that the charter doesn't  
say "A mechanism" but "mechanisms", so revising RFC 4474 or  
documenting an alternative is arguably within the scope of our charter.


Is developing the requirements for #1 above something we can actually  
accomplish with a strong consensus? I hope so.

But do we have the political will to achieve such a consensus? That's  
what I'd like to hear from you.

For the following two:

Sep 2008 X.509 Certificates for TLS use in SIP to IESG
	-- Waiting on Keith

Sep 2008 X.509 extended key usage for SIP to IESG
	-- Waiting on Keith

There has been a major change in domain-certs since WGLC which I am
waiting for enough people in the WG to read (and if necessary to object
to).

There is a potential further change coming in based on comments from
PKIX - see Vijay's message of a few days back.

And having worked my way through both of them, I will be trying to take
some time in Dublin with the editor's to clean a few things up!

Agree - this was considered. If this had seemed unworkable for the  
DRINKS folks, we would not have done this.

Of course the overlap is considered - but looking at it as the overlap  
of everything SIP does and everything  DRINKS does it leads one to the  
wrong conclusion. A better way to look at it is, can the SIP chairs  
arrange the material they have for this specific meeting for three  
hours such that the stuff they put in the 1/3 of time that overlaps  
with DRINKS does not have large overlap with DRINKS.  When you look at  
who is participating in the discussion around the items in SIP right  
now and the work in DRINKS, I think this is possible. It is certainly  
not ideal - a lot of permutations and combinations were looked at -  
none were good.

The basic problem is that to create a bunch of time for new work in  
RAI, we need to get some of the things currently using time to use  
less time - that can be done by finishing work or deciding that work  
is not longer a priority and removing it.

This part of the charter was written to cover the work in RFC 4474 and  
RFC 4916.

As folks figure out what is the problem that Dean wants to solve  
around Identity and what solutions are possible, we can figure out if  
it should happen in SIP, SIPPING, or a new WG and adjust charters  
accordingly.

Hi All,

When two useragents subscribed to peer-peer Presence.

For example:

 UserAgentA ----SUBSCRIBE-------> UserAgentB
 UserAgentA <----200OK------- UserAgentB
 UserAgentA <----NOTIFY(ONLINE)------- UserAgentB
 UserAgentA <----SUBSCRIBE------- UserAgentB
 UserAgentA ----200OK-------> UserAgentB
 UserAgentA ----NOTIFY(ONLINE)-------> UserAgentB

 After Sometime UserAgentB restarted, before it goes to reboot, it send
UnSubscribe to UserAgentA.

 UserAgentA <----SUBSCRIBE(Expires:0)------- UserAgentB
 UserAgentA ----200OK(Expires:0)-------> UserAgentB

 What would be expected behavior on UserAgentA?

   - should carry UserAgentB has a online/offline on UserAgentA ?
   - when UserAgentA receives subscribe(from UserAgentB) with expires 0,
UserAgentA should remove the status  of UserAgentB?

Any response is highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Regards
Sudhir

All,

I squeezed in an update before the IETF72 cut-off. The changelog:

      * Added text in the introduction as well as in sections 4 and 5.3
        to address WGLC comments.
      * Added Subscription-State field in example flows
      * Fixed figure numbering mismatch

The full diff to version 02 is available here:
http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sip/draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags/draft-ietf-sip-subnot-etags-03-from-02.diff.html

(Note that there is a regression since 02: a few typos that were fixed
aren't any more. Even though I was using SVN...)

>From my point of view, this draft is ready for publication (modulo a few
remaining typos).

Cheers,
Aki

Dean,

Agreed, and several of the recent drafts focus on defining the problem,
rather than a solution.

Here are a set of comments to start/continue some discussions on the  
199 draft around.
Many of them are nits. Some of them are fairly big.

The draft has quite a bit of cooking to go through yet, but its mostly  
of a nature that can be
cooked through fairly quickly I think. I plan to spend time in the  
hall with Christer to address
what we haven't killed off on list this week.

----

1) The header says intended status is Informational? You mean PS, right?

2) The draft is still unclear about proxy interaction with the 199  
idea, particularly
      when it comes to sending them reliably. We need to spend more  
time making
      the text clear, being particularly careful when there are  
multiple proxies in the
      path of a response. I bring this up here as a general comment  
because I don't
      think just fixing individual sections is going to be good enough  
- I think its going
      to take a holistic editing pass to address.

3) In section 6 you talk of a non-2xx final response terminating one  
or more early
     dialogs. Can you give me an example scenario where "more" comes  
into play?
     (preferably add one to the text)? I'm having a hard time seeing  
how this ever more
      than one.

4) Section 6 says the proxy MUST send a 199 when it receives on of  
these non-2xx
      final responses. Why is this MUST and not MAY?
      There's no Require header here. We can have motivational text  
saying why
      proxies might really want to, but saying MUST or even SHOULD  
seems wrong
      from a protocol requirement point of view.

5) With respect to that same requirement - it looks right now like  
you're requiring
      the proxy to 199 this to-tag even if the UAS that generated it  
already did and the
      proxy already forwarded that 199 even.

6) Section 6 paragraph one's "MAY release resources" might be  
misconstrued to
      imply releasing the transaction state, which is NOT what you  
mean. I'll propose
      text to help try to avoid that later.

7) Section 7: "A UAC that receives a 199 response for an early dialog  
MUST NOT
    send any further requests on that dialog...". Can you point to any  
list discussion
    around this requirement? I think there's some danger to consider  
there. At the
     very least we need to make this statement multiple-usage safe.

8) The last paragraph of section 7 uses MUST NOT and MUST where it  
really
      should be using does not and is. This paragraph describes things  
that are
      rather than mandate behavior.

9) Section 8 second open issue: We agreed that we were not addressing  
HERFP
      with this draft. If we are going to open this mechanism up to  
something that
      even _partially_ starts to address HERFP (by, as proposed,  
including the
      non-2xx response that caused the 199), then we need to stop work  
on this
      draft and go work on HERFP. In other words, my vode for the  
answer to this
      open issue is "NO".

10) Section 8 first open issue: This looks, at best, to be an  
optimization of an
        optimization. Considered in the light of having multiple  
proxies on the
        response path that would have to do extra parsing work because  
of this
        optimization, I don't think we should consider it further.

11) I can't follow the second paragraph of section 9 at all. Can you  
rephrase it?
       Once I know what its trying to say, I'll propose alternate text.

12) The open issue in section 10 (can we get a proxy involved in  
sending its own
        199 reliably) is a big part of the confusion I pointed to at  
the beginning of
        these comments. This is the part of the draft that I expected  
needing face time
        in Dublin, but maybe we can make enough progress on it in the  
hallway.
        I don't think there's any way to allow it, and what we'll need  
instead is text
        more strongly recommending the endpoints do this themselves  
and restrict
        any proxy genesis of 199s to the unreliable case (and explain  
more that this
        is just a transitionary optimization - we _really_ want the  
endpoints doing this
        work if anything's going to be doing it at all.

13) The security considerations section is TBD.
        There's a lot to talk through here. For instance, I can spoof  
199s to affect how a call
        is ultimately answered in ways that are different (from the  
endpoints visibility into
        what happened point-of-view) from cancels/byes or even other  
response manipulation.

Keith: Regarding draft-ietf-sip-eku, we have received word from
PKIX that the text in the current version of the draft (-02)
can proceed as is.  So technically, there will not be any
changes in what is described in -02.

Scott and I can meet up with you in Dublin to get your comments on
cleaning it up, but I suspect that any cleanup now will be more
editorial in nature.

Thank you.

	The resource-lists schema in RFC 4826 does not match the normative  
text wrt whether the "anchor" attribute is required in <external>  
elements.

The normative text reads:

"
    The <external> element has a single
    mandatory attribute, "anchor", which specifies the external list by
    means of an absolute HTTP URI.
"

The schema reads:

"
     <xs:complexType name="externalType">
      <xs:sequence>
       <xs:element name="display-name" type="display-nameType"
        minOccurs="0"/>
       <xs:any namespace="##other" processContents="lax" minOccurs="0"
        maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      </xs:sequence>
      <xs:attribute name="anchor" type="xs:anyURI"/>
      <xs:anyAttribute namespace="##other" processContents="lax"/>
     </xs:complexType>
"

	Should I go ahead and file an erratum?

Here's a new version of the SIP agenda that may make some of you folks  
happier:

Tuesday

Min	Topic
5 	Agenda, Status, Announcements, and Throwing of Folding Currency at  
Chairs
25 	Steps to Draft Standard -- RJS
30 	Delivery of Request URI and Parameters to UAS -- JDR
30 	Info Issues -- Eric Burger
30	Identity Issues -- John Elwell


Thursday

Min	Topic
5	Agenda
25	UA Initiated Privacy -- Mayumi Munakata
20	199 -- Christer
10	Keepalive -- Christer
TBD Record route fix -- Thomas Froment (if we have issues appear on- 
list).

We may also have to make adjustments for any of the other WGLC docs  
that develops an issue requiring face-to-face resolution.


A pretty hyper-linked version with a reading list (that includes some  
expired INFO documents for historical purpose) is at:

http://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/SIP_Agenda_IETF_72

and I'll be getting that onto the official IETF site soon.

Most excellent agenda.

objects at chairs"? I don't want to be throwing my extra-expensive euros 
at you guys...

In case y'all don't already know this ... there is a free shuttle
between the hotel and three drop-off points in the city
(http://www.ietf.org/meetings/72/Shuttle-Info_v5.pdf).

Although that will not help you get *to* the hotel from the city
in the mornings; the first shuttle leaves the city at 10:00 AM.
I wonder why they did that, considering the sessions start at
9:00 AM...

This is a very good catch. This needs to be aligned with dialogusage. If 
the 199 contained the final response that triggered it, then that final 
response could be used to determine the impact on the dialog or dialog 
usage or just the transaction. But if the 199 doesn't contain the final 
response, then this is a problem.

If the "proxy" wants to send a reliable 199, then I think it needs to do 
so on its own dialog. But that makes no sense. Having the proxy attempt 
to send the reliable response on the dialog belonging to the UAS is 
*insane*.

Presumption is that you stay at the CityWest, and the bus is for  
getting meals in the city.

So I've made what is probably a mistake and booked in Tallaght, which  
is the last stop on the LUAS Red Line on the way to the City West.   
But it is only about 60 euros a night.

It has some level of bus service to the meeting site, and is  
supposedly only a couple of miles from the City West, although I'm  
told now that this is on a very busy country road and walking or  
biking would likely be suicidal. No way to win at this game, eh?

But I think we all agree that there are some problems with existing SBCs. S=
o if there is a SIP compliant solution for these problems, why not use it n=
ow? Of course we still would have to discuss if Dale's proposal is SIP comp=
liant.

Finding guidelines for describing the behaviour of SBCs probably would take=

I have just a couple of nits:

1. State labeled Completed on Figure 2 should be labeled Accepted

2. section 7.3 paragraph 1 contains "... receiving any response SIP
response ..."

3. While whole section 18 in RFC 3261 deals with SIP transport layer
regardless transaction stateful or stateless behavior, it could be
explicitly clarified that suggested change of section 18.1.2 (in invfix
section 8.8) tells just about stateful behavior.

4. INVITE server state machine doesn't react to transport error in
Accepted state. It could contain transition from Accepted to Terminated
state conditioned by transport error - analogy to transitions from
Proceeding and Completed states.

Re:draft-sparks-sip-invfix-01: comments and questions)

Ok, I've just submitted -02 of the INVITE fix draft.

There is one really big change to correct the bug Brett found in the  
thread below.
There's a new state in the INVITE client transaction and an associated  
new timer.

The attempt to reuse Completed as in the previous draft  didn't work  
out -
Setting Timer D to 0 for TCP caused the wrong things to happen if we  
were in
that state waiting for additional 2xxs. So, instead of always setting  
Timer D to 64*T1,
regardless of transport,  this draft uses a new "Accepted" state  
instead. This way
transactions that get a 3xx or greater response over TCP can still go  
away quickly.

There's a smaller related change - 3261 had setting Timer D at SHOULD  
strength.
I can't remember why that wasn't a MUST (and neither can anyone I've  
asked), and
it _really_ breaks things if it doesn't get set when using UDP, so  
I've changed that
to a MUST in this draft.

Please review this carefully. (We really need a _lot_ of people to  
think about it, not
just a few).

Eric,

I like the idea of an Identity Working Group because it would attract others who, like you said, don't care as much about some of the SIP connection issues. However, given that "identity" is such a loaded term these days on the Internet, I think we need to be clear that this is about *SIP* identity and not about general Internet identity issues. Otherwise we could easily wind up off in the land of web identity, OpenID, etc.

I even have a name for you... How about something like:

CIRCUS - Communication Identity & Relationships Using SIP

:-)

In this case, I would offer we have the same, awful user experience.   
Alice connects to the VM system, and the call is immediately dropped  
(dialog dies).  Alice calls her service provider and says, "Voice Mail  
is broken."  Or, Alice connects to the VM system, and the VM system is  
totally unresponsive (dialog does not die).  Alice calls her phone  
manufacturer and says, "your phone doesn't work" or calls her service  
provider and says, "my phone doesn't work."

Now assume your very highly paid customer service rep at the service  
provider trying to debug the dialog does not die scenario...

Must be different registries for all the reasons JDR & Paul mention.

I am torn on the Proprietary Registry, however.  We *think* we know  
all the bizarre ways people use INFO in the world, but I am constantly  
surprised by some of the "unique" things that get discussed on the SIP  
Forum Discussion list.  On the one hand, we would want to have an open  
call for proprietary implementations so we can register and analyze  
them.  On the other hand, one could see how that could encourage new,  
yet obsolete, INFO usages.

Given that at least two of the extant INFO I-D's enumerate the classes  
of INFO usage in the wild, is there ANY value to a Proprietary INFO  
Registry?

I would offer two courses of action:

1. Bring SIP to Draft the easy way (3261-bis), as it will eliminate a  
bunch of options that are really proprietary extensions.

2. Bring SIP to Draft the hard way (bring all related drafts  
together), as it will reduce the number of (sometimes conflicting)  
documents as well as start the clock on reducing the options that just  
don't go together.

My personal vote is for #2, but I do not think there is enough energy  
behind the effort to get it done.

I agree, it depends on the use cases and one rule does not apply in all
cases. Another use case is for an IVR system and in that case as well,
where if dtmf usage does not work, there is no point in continuing with
the dialog.

I'm happy to see this finally WGLC'd, too!



Overall:

The framework document needs to require endpoints send and
receive ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation.  Without support
for that draft, many of the media security requirements cannot be 
met (as mentioned in A.1 of draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework-02).
ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation should be promoted
to a normative requirement, and should be required (MUST) for 
endpoints to support in order to adhere to the DTLS-SRTP framework.  
Otherwise, we are hosed for forking and hosed for retargeting.




Section 1, Introduction:

   However, even hop-by-hop security such as provided by SIPS provides
   some protection against modification by attackers who are not on the
   signalling path.

With or without SIPS, if the attacker is off the signalling path, the
attacker has little hope of doing much damage -- they need to 
guess a lot of SDP values and guess a bunch of SIP values (call-id)
in order to be successful.

So, I would replace the last phrase with:

"... who are not in control of on-path signaling elements."

resulting in:

   However, even hop-by-hop security such as provided by SIPS provides
   some protection against modification by attackers who are not in 
   control of on-path signaling elements."
 

Section 5, Exchanging Certificates:

(the text exceeds the section title when it goes beyond just what 
happens with certificate exchange; perhaps consider re-titling).

My slightly more substantive comment is:

  The answerer SHOULD use the setup	attribute value of 
  setup:active and will send the client_hello in the media path."
                   ^^^^
                   MUST



Section 6.6, "ICE Interaction":

   ...
   If ICE is not being used, then there is potential for a bad
   interaction with SBCs via "latching", as described in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-media-path-middleboxes].  In order to avoid this
   issue, if ICE is not being used and the DTLS handshake has not
   completed, upon receiving the other side's then the passive side MUST
                                             ^
                                            SDP

   do a single unauthenticated STUN [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis]
   connectivity check in order to open up the appropriate pinhole. 


Requirements to do something when ICE is *not* being used should not be in a
section titled "ICE Interaction".  I would move this paragraph describing how
to handle SBC 'latching' to its own section perhaps titled "SBC Interaction".


Section 8.6,

   o When phone number URIs (e.g., 
     'sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com') are used, 

I believe the current consensus is that a phone number would include
;user=phone, so the example should be
sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com;user=phone



Section 8.6, "Limits of Identity Assertions"

(This section is well written.)


   Implementors should therefore take care not to indicate
   misleading peer identity information in the user interface. e.g.  If
                                                             ^^^^^^
                                               formatting error around here
   the peer's identity is sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com, it is
   not sufficient to display that the identity of the peer as
   +17005551008, unless there is some policy that states that the domain
   "chicago.example.com" is trusted to assert E.164 numbers. 

chicago.example.com only needs to be trusted to assert numbers you trust
it to assert -- not a blanked "to assert E.164 numbers".  For example,
I might trust, and expect, Verizon to claim E.164s that it owns, but
I do not trust, nor expect, Verizon to claim an E.164 with a +353
country code.

I would revise the above to end with something like:

   ... unless there is some policy that states that the domain
   "chicago.example.com" is trusted to assert the E.164 number
   is it asserting.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


later,

   Otherwise, the recipient cannot rely on the RFC 4474 Identity
   assertion and the UA MUST not indicate to the user that a secure call
                        ^^^^^^^^
                        MUST NOT
   has been established to the claimed identity.  Implementations which
   are configured to only establish secure calls SHOULD terminate the
   call in this case.




Section A.3:  


add a reference to draft-ietf-avt-dtls-srtp-03.txt
which describes how session resumption is supposed to be
implemented.



Section A.12., "3rd Party Certificates (R-CERTS, R-EXISTING)"

   Third party certificates are not required.  However, if the parties
   share an authentication infrastructure that is compatible with TLS
   (3rd party certificates or shared keys) it can be used.


RFC4474 is part of the framework for securing DTLS-SRTP, and
as you know there is a lot of consternation around this point.
Citing section 13.4 of RFC4474 would be helpful, because section
A.12 of sip-dtls-srtp-framework relies on the following small 
sentence in Section 13.4 of RFC4474:

   It
   is strongly RECOMMENDED that self-signed domain certificates should
   not be trusted by verifiers, unless some previous key exchange has
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   justified such trust.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Section A.15, Denial of Service Vulnerability (R-DOS)

Please add a reference to Section 4.2.1 of RFC4347.



Section A.18., "Downgrading Protection (R-DOWNGRADE)"

   DTLS provides protection against downgrading attacks since the
   selection of the offered ciphersuites is confirmed in a later stage
   of the handshake.  This protection is efficient unless an adversary
   is able to break a ciphersuite in real-time.

This should also mention integrity protection of signaling is 
necessary in order to prevent downgrade to RTP (because I believe
we need to require sdp-capability-negotiation for all of this to
work correctly.)

I would think it would be advisable for the UAC in this case to provide 
some sort of feedback to the user that the dtmf isn't working.
E.g. instead of playing the dtmf tone to its user, it could play 
nothing, or some error tone. Would probably hear the normal tone for the 
first button pressed, but after that, when the UAC has received an error 
for the INFO, the other behavior would kick in.

This of course doesn't *solve* the problem. But then nothing will short 
of the UAS supporting the dtfm.

If the UAS doesn't support DTMF, there will be a problem even if the 
dtmf is sent in the media stream. Probably if telephone-events can't be 
negotiated the tones will simply be sent in the audio stream, and there 
will be no feedback if they aren't understood. So almost anything done 
here will be an improvement.

I've been tagged as proto shepherd for outbound.

Here's a draft writeup. Please look through it. If there are no  
objections, it will accompany the publication request to the IESG on  
Friday.

--------


    (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
           Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
           document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
           version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

SIP chair Dean Willis is serving as the Document Shepherd for this
document.  He has personally reviewed this document and believes it is
as ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication as it is ever
going to get.


    (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
           and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
           any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
           have been performed?

The document has been intensively reviewed within the working
group. It was formally reviewed by John Elwell:

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg22870.html.

which resulted in several small changes.


    (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
           needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
           e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
           AAA, internationalization or XML?

The shepherd has no such concerns.

    (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
           issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
           and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
           or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document,  
or
           has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
           event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
           that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
           concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this  
document
           been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the
           disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on
           this issue.

The shepherd has no specific concerns with this document.

    (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
           represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
           others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
           agree with it?

Working group consensus is quite strong for this document. It was
considered "high profile" during the entire cycle, and has been very
thoroughly discussed. Numerous design changes were made in the process
in order to accomodate various points of view.


    (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated  
extreme
           discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
           separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.   
(It
           should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
           entered into the ID Tracker.)

The shepherd is unaware of any extreme discontent with this version of
the draft. A previous version that did not require two "outbound
proxy" entries was disparaged on-list, but the document was revised to
accomodate this issue.



    (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
           document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
           http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
           http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
           not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the  
document
           met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
           Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The document appears to satisfy the various checklist nits.

    (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
           informative?  Are there normative references to documents  
that
           are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
           state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
           strategy for their completion?  Are there normative  
references
           that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
           so, list these downward references to support the Area
           Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

References are appropriately divided. There is one reference to a
draft that has been revised, but this does not impact the document.

    (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
           consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
           of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
           extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
           registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
           the document creates a new registry, does it define the
           proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
           procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggest a
           reasonable name for the new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the
           document describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd
           conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG
           can appoint the needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

This document specifies seven IANA actions that appear to be valid and
complete. It defines no new registry or expert review process.

    (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
           document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
           code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
           an automated checker?

The document shepherd verified the ABNF using Bill Fenner's checker.



    (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
           Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
           Announcement Write-Up?  Recent examples can be found in the
           "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
           announcement contains the following sections:




Technical Summary

This document defines a n extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) that provides for persistent and reusable connections between
SIP User Agents and SIP Proxy Servers. In particular, this allows
proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP
datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a
large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such
as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs)
or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers
from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification
defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars and proxy servers that
allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by
the User Agent.  It also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep
NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from
the User Agent to its Registrar.




Working Group Summary

The working group process on this document was exceptionally long. The
first WG version of the draft appeared in the summer of 2005. Working
group last call initiated in the summer of 2006 and extended until the
summer of 2008, requring several iterations of the draft and the
assignment of Francois Audet as a "process champion" for the draft
within the working group. Most delays seem to have been related to
slow cycle time on the part of the authors, but the process was also
delayed by a number of changes occurring during the review cycle.

Particular sticking points included the keepalive mechanism and a
requirement for binding to multiple outbound proxies if so
configured. The latter was eventually resolved by a widely-accepted
compromise, but the keepalive topic is still being debated.  Although
there is a strong consensus for the keepalive technique specified in
this document, there is some reason to believe that there may be a
need for the keeplaive mechanism independently of the outbound
relationship. There is currently a draft proposing such a mechanism.

This suggests that it might have been more effective to document the
outbound binding and keepalive mechanisms independently.


Document Quality

There are numerous implementations of the protocol, and it has been
tested at SIPit events since 2005.

In reviewing the document I have the following comments. In general I
found the document appropriately complete and ready for submission.

1)	Does the document update RFC 3261. The particular normative
statement I am thinking of is:

   For all MIME-based extensions to work, the recipient needs to be able
   to decode the multipart bodies.  Therefore, SIP UAs MUST be able to
   parse 'multipart' MIME bodies, including nested body parts.  In
   particular, UAs MUST support the 'multipart/mixed' and 'multipart/
   alternative' MIME types.

My understanding is that we do not want to regard this as an extenision,
i.e. we wish all RFC 3261 implementations to abide by it. Does that
therefore not mean an "updates".

2)	Does the document update RFC 3204. Here the particular
requirements I am thinking of is:

   If at least one of the body parts within a 'multipart/mixed' body has
   a 'handling' value of 'required', the UA MUST set the 'handling'
   parameter of the 'multipart/mixed' body to 'required'.  If all the
   body parts within a 'multipart/mixed' body have a 'handling' value of
   'optional', the UA MUST set the 'handling' parameter of the
   'multipart/mixed' body to 'optional'.

   If the handling of a 'multipart/alternative' body is required, the UA
   MUST set the 'handling' parameter of the 'multipart/alternative' body
   to 'required'.  The UA SHOULD also set the 'handling' parameter of
   all the body part within the 'multipart/alternative' to 'optional'
   (the receiver will process the body parts based on the handling
   parameter of the 'multipart/alternative' body; the receiver will
   ignore the handling parameters of the body parts).  The UA MUST use
   the same disposition type for the 'multipart/alternative' body and
   all its body parts.

Again this seems to be further specifying the handling parameter defined
in RFC 3204 rather than defining an extension.

3)	Section 4.3: 

   UAs SHOULD avoid unnecessarily nesting body parts because doing so
   would, unnecessarily, make processing the body more laborious for the
   receiver.

I had some problem with this because it seems an impossible statement to
determine conformance to. Is the RFC 2119 language therefore
appropriate.

4)	Section 11, IANA considerations.

Should the following registry not be updated to add a reference to this
draft (in addition to [RFC3261]):

Registry Name: Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values
Reference: [RFC3968]
Registration Procedures: Published RFC (A standards-track RFC is NOT
required)

Registry:
                                                           Predefined
Header Field                  Parameter Name               Values
Reference
----------------------------  ---------------------------  ----------
---------                                     
Content-Disposition           handling                     Yes
[RFC3261]

I also had a number of editorial comments which I have sent directly to
Gonzalo.

Regards

Keith

IMO this MUST be an update to 3204. It is tightening down incomplete 
specification. Without it being mandatory it isn't helpful.

IMO this SHOULD be an update to 3261. There are just too many needed 
uses of multipart that just won't work if you can't count on it being 
supported. The alternative is to try it, and if it fails, try again 
without the multipart. That presumes it makes sense to leave something 
out to get down to one part, and you can guess *which* part to fall back 
to. OTOH, making it mandatory won't make it happen. But I think that may 
just be a matter of giving some time, as long as it has been made mandatory.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi
=20
I have seen some discussion happened on this topic in the following mail
trail, but still not clear with one thing:
https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/sip-implementors/2003-December/0
05829.html
=20
=20
Is there any use case where we receive second REFER message that creates
a subscription while there exists an already an 'active' REFER
subscription in the same dialog? RFC 3515 has given a use case by saying
that "If more than one REFER is issued in the same dialog (a second
attempt at transferring a call for example)". But in the above scenario,
I assume that the first attempt to call transfer has failed (i.e. first
REFER subscription terminated).
=20
Please clarify me.

Hi
=20
To solve this problem we could use the mechanism defined in RFC 4488 -
Suppression of SIP Refer method Implicit subscription.=20
=20
So here when the UAC i.e the REFER Issuer is sending the 2nd REFER
request, it can follow the procedures defined in above RFC so that the
REFER recipient does not create another implicit subscription for the
REFER request.
=20
But here too it is not clear how the REFER issuer would know if the
REFER recipient supports RFC 4488 or not - unless REFER recipient
inserts the mentioned option-tags in the response to first REFER request
-- because if it does not, then implicit subscription is anyway created
for 2nd REFER request too as per RFC 3515.

Hi Dale,

what we have tried to do with this draft is to clarify things that were 
unclear and to specify stuff that we think it is essential (e.g., 
support for multipart). Since a certain degree of backwards 
compatibility has to be achieved, we are not free to specify whatever we 
want at this point. As you point out, maybe some pathological cases are 
not well covered, but we need to work within the constrains given by the 
current situation.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Hi,

I understand that the conclusion of this thread is that we may want to 
tackle the issue of large SIP messages (not only bodies) at some point 
but that this is not the appropriate draft to do so. So, I will not make 
any changes to the draft.

Thanks for all your comments,

Gonzalo

Imagine an outbound proxy handling numerous endpoints to the registrar, with one TCP connection to the registrar - if it passes any body size up to the registrar willy-nilly, any endpoint's random 10MB body will impact message forwarding for all others due to HOL. (heck, given the horsepower of some nodes, a 64KB body could too)  Then there's also the reality of TCP not being exactly ubiquitous, to put it mildly, and the odds of a >64KB message making it not being too high.

yes, I think this document should update RFC 3261. I will add that to 
the draft.

Yes, I will also add to the draft that it updates RFC 3204.

Well, you are right that the "unnecessarily" makes it sound like a 
motherhood-and-apple-pie statement. But you could actually check 
conformance to it. If an implementation nests a body part without having 
a specific reason to do it, then it is not conformant. Any implementer 
should know why he or she is doing something. So, I would like to keep 
the capitalized SHOULD. In any case, if you have a strong opinion on 
this, it would not be a big deal for me to make the statement 
non-normative instead.

yes, that is probably be a good idea. I will add that to the draft.

Yes, I will introduce those editorial changes in the next revision of 
the draft.

Section 6.2 explains exactly this. If you would like to propose some 
introductory text to clarify what is defined there, I will be happy to 
add it.

Paul already answered this one. There are issues with how different 
methods are routed. Describing the limitations of the Accept-* mechanism 
is the best thing we can do, IMO.

the paragraph in the draft does not contain normative statements because 
it is simply giving background information (per the title of the 
section) about normative statements in other documents. Therefore, we 
cannot really use normative statements there.

However, I agree that "this way" is not a good link between both 
sentences. I will simply remove it.

What do you have in mind? I guess you are thinking of a body whose 
handling is required but its "father's" handling was optional. But the 
rules in Section 6.2 intend to keep that from happening. Could you give 
us an example where this happens?

Per RFC 4485, we are supposed to specify the behaviors of UACs and UASs 
separately. That is what the draft does. The note you are referring to 
is just an informative note.

> The sentence before that one is peculiar: "If the handling of a
> 'multipart/alternative' body is required, the UA MUST set the
> 'handling' parameter of the 'multipart/alternative' body to
> 'required'."  This seems tautological -- why is it stated?

It is there for completeness. If you put that sentence in context, 
together with the next sentence in the text, it makes sense to state it 
like that so that the specification is not ambiguous, I think.

> In section 7.3, it is stated that "If the SIP message contains a

Section 7.4 explains that we define the 'by-reference' disposition type 
to avoid that problem. The last paragraph on Section 7.4 explains that 
in the past, option tags have been used to avoid that same problem.

Thanks for your comments,

Gonzalo

You are not likely to run into this for transfer.

I'm not aware of any applications that will exercise this use case  
today, but I expect someone eventually will come up with something (it  
might look like referring a UA to multiple MSRP connections or some  
other conference-like mesh, or somebody may eventually try to use  
REFER to ask the UA to look at several things over HTTP at once).

The id= parameter on the Event header in the notify is there to allow  
you to tell the subscriptions apart (so you can manage those usages  
independently). The element accepting the REFERs is required to send  
it  in the NOTIFYs of the  second and subsequent subscriptions. Again,  
I haven't seen attempts to use this capability in applications yet -  
it would not surprise me if there's something there that turns out to  
be really hard (like figuring out which of those subscriptions goes  
with which REFER).

What Robert said.

Perhaps it is possible that the operation requested by the first refer 
fails, and is notified, but does not *immediately* terminate the 
subscription. (Not that I can think of a reason why.) Then the requester 
might try another refer and get a second subscription before the first 
goes away.

In the usual way of things, you should probably try to avoid creating 
such a situation, unless you have some as yet unknown good reason. But 
if you are on the receiving side you should do the right thing if it 
happens to you.

The key thing we need to do is write a statement where we clearly understand whether the implementor has chosen not to apply the constraint.

Is it possible to write "SHOULD NOT nest" in this case, and then give some examples of where we might expect that to be broken. That then gives a clear test of conformance to the requirement, and the assessor of conformance can then decide whether breaking the SHOULD was acceptable or not.

If there are key aspects where be know nesting are best used, then maybe we should bring those out as separate requirements in RFC 2119 language, i.e. if <condition> then MUST nest else SHOULD NOT nest. But I suspect that we do not actually have anything specific for this. Speak up if anyone knows of any.

I know we do have this paragraph in section 4.1:

   Nested MIME bodies are yet another useful tool to build and combine
   SIP extensions.  Using the extensions in the previous examples, a UA
   that supported a new session description format and that needed to
   include a location object in an INVITE request would include a
   'multipart/mixed' body with two body parts: a location object and a
   'multipart/alternative'.  The 'multipart/alternative' body part
   would, in turn, have two body parts: a session description written in
   SDP and a session description written in the newer session
   description format.

But thinking about this, I suspect we define no semantics anywhere (please correct me if I am wrong) about what nesting means. Does a nested body require different interpretation to a multipart body, and if so, how do I discover what that difference is. All the nesting would seem to tell me is that there might be a different relationship, but it does not tell me what that relationship is.

Dears SIP wg participants,

You may be surprised that I come to comment the 
draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework-02 at this point in time - I am also!

Anyway, my comment is about DTLS protocol compliance and the use of 
self-signed certificates. Maybe there are things I don't see, but I 
wonder if the envisioned use of self-signed certificates is compliant 
with DTLS, even assuming the "legitimacy" of accepting self-signed 
certificates without a strong trust base in the PKI spirit.

Here are the technical details. I assume the DTLS server protocol entity 
"S" wishes to accept either "self-signed" EE certificates or 
certificates issued by a couple of trusted CA (requirement R-EXISTING). 
"S" would send a DTLS certificate request message containing either an 
empty list of CA distinguished names (meaning "I accept any CA") of a 
list of CA distinguished name (meaning "I trust these CAs"). In the 
latter case, the DTLS client protocol entity "C" would not be allowed to 
send a self-signed EE certificate. In the former case, "C" would be 
allowed to send any certificate it has on hand, including a self-signed 
EE certificate.

There are two alternate adjustments to the draft I see that would 
improve its technical quality if the above paragraph is correct:

A)	State explicitly that the empty list of CA distinguished names (in 
DTLS certificate request messages) option applies. It is then preferable 
to describe the self-signed EE certificate as a special case of e.g. 
"any X.509 security certificate holding a public key that the end entity 
controls (of which the end entity controls the private key counterpart)".

B)	Specify a public domain private key value (i.e. breached, snake-oil, 
meaningless ...) and a dummy CA distinguished name for the corresponding 
public key and let the EE auto-issue an X.509 certificate under this CA 
as a replacement of certificate self-signature.

The idea for option B) was recently submitted to the PKIX wg (see 
http://www.imc.org/ietf-pkix/mail-archive/msg04498.html) and its 
relevance to the draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework (and to 
draft-ietf-avt-dtls-srtp as well) was raised by one of its authors.

Hope it helps,

--

It's explicitly compliant with DTLS. Here's what RFC 4346 says about
certificates (S 1)

   the decisions on how to initiate TLS
   handshaking and how to interpret the authentication certificates
   exchanged are left to the judgment of the designers and implementors
   of protocols that run on top of TLS.

Yes, both of these are legal in this instance. The basic setting
is one in which any certificate is accepted, but implementations
could of course be configured to require 3rd party certificates.

I don't have a problem with indicating that the server should 
provide a compatible CertificateRequest message, but honestly
I think this is redundant, since DTLS/TLS specify how to construct
the CertificateREquest.

I don't think this is that great an idea. The semantics of self-signed
certs are commonly understood and I don't think this adds much
value.

Does a nested body require different interpretation to a multipart body, and if so, how do I discover what that difference is. All the nesting would seem to tell me is that there might be a different relationship, but it does not tell me what that relationship is.

I agree that the current loose wording leaves something to be desired.
I just don't know how to fix it.

Let me give a concrete example:

Is an INVITE valid if it contains a body of:

	multipart/mixed {
	   multipart/mixed {
	      multipart/mixed {
	         application/sdp
	}}}

Must the UAS keep unwrapping multiparts, looking for its SDP?

And while we are discussing weird cases, what about:

	multipart/mixed {
	   multipart/mixed {
	      multipart/mixed {
	         application/sdp-1
	      }
	      application/sdp-2
	}}

If the latter is legal at all, which sdp is the offer? And what should 
happen to the other one?

I know these are bizarre cases. I'm just pushing the envelope to 
understand the implications for the sorts of decoding logic the stack 
should be expected to use.

	Thanks,
	Paul

It's not the server behavior that would benefit from a document 
clarification, it's the client's behavior. If the CertificateRequest 
message contains an empty list of distinguished names, it is valid for 
the client entity to send EITHER 1) a self-signed security certificate 
or 2) any certificate holding a public key it controls. The document 
ambiguity, as it stands, is whether 2) is allowed in the two drafts as 
it is in the bare DTLS.

It would allow a server to announce its preferred trusted CAs 
(fulfilling R-EXISTING) *AND* its willingness to accept "auto-issued" 
certificates. An EE having (genuine) certificates from CA-1 and CA-2 
would select among these two per server expressed preferences. I guess 
you see the point.

But admittedly, I can't speak much for the SIP application area.

I don't think it's ambigous, but I'll try to add some clarifying
text.

Yes, this seems to me to be of relatively modest value. In any
case, this is a feature which could easily be added at some point
in the future if such a fake CA ever existed.

1. I think there should be something pointing out the limitations of
GRUU for obtaining an anonymous contact URI. A temporary GRUU will still
reveal the issuing domain, i.e., the domain with which the user
registers. For the From URI we specify sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid
(except where SIP Identity is used), but I don't see the point in this
if Contact reveals the domain.

2. In section 5.3, I think there should be a statement about sending the
SIP request to the relay server.

3. "A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification SHOULD conceal host names in any SIP headers, such as
   Call-ID and Warning headers, but it is not always regarded as
   essential privacy-sensitive information."
I don't understand what is mean by "not always regarded as essential
privacy-sensitive information". Either a host name in such a header
field is privacy-sensitive or it is not, so the word "essential" seems
redundant.

4. In the Security Considerations section, should there be mention of
the fact that a STUN relay server can introduce addition security
considerations if the signalling and/or media are not appropriately
secured, e.g., using TLS or SRTP?

5. I have a large number of editorial points, which I will submit
directly to the author.

Hi,

	Could any one reason out, why the UAS replies 403 forbidden for an
REGISTER request at times and 200 OK for the same request.


Thanks in advance,
Midun.S

Hi,
=20
RFC3261 specifies Date header in the following format:-=20
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2008 12:01:08 GMT
=20
RFC4119 specifes retention-expiry in the following format:-
   <gp:retention-expiry>2007-07-27T18:00:00Z</gp:retention-expiry>
=20
This seems like another format for representing absolute time.=20
=20
Could somebody provide me info, on which RFC is this absolute time based
on.
=20
Any idea how this can be implemented in Linux for sending and parsing.
=20
Thanks.
Regards,
Rajeev

Dear Eric, SIP participants:

	I don't want to argue on the overall question of EE self-signed 
certificates for SIP security requirements. However, some basic facts 
should be noted, if only for the record.

	The basic TLS handshake has some "features" which are noteworthy in the 
present context:

1)	The TLS protocol provides no direct support for EE public keys that 
are not conveyed in X.509 security certificates.

2)	The TLS protocol Certificate Request message does not allow a server 
to announce its willingness to accept at once EE self-signed 
certificates and a list of trusted CA names.

3)	This leaves a server operator wishing to support EE self-signed 
certificates *and* a list of trusted CA names with the following dilemma:

	a)	it announces its list of trusted CAs in the Certificate Request 
message and fails to support the EE self-signed certificate mechanism, or

	b)	it announces its willingness to accept any CA in EE certificates 
returned by clients, and then will experience EEs returning 
certificates issued by untrusted CAs.

	Obviously, this is a property of the TLS protocol not specific to SIP. 
Point 1) is the basic issue. Point 2) arises when the EE self-signed 
certificate mechanism is introduced as a hack for point 1). Point 3) is 
a side-effect of this hack.

	The SIP security framework requires a solution to 1). This requirement 
is parhaps not unique. The selection of the EE self-signed certificate 
hack should be done under full disclosure of the above, plus the 
availability of another hack contributed at the start of this thread.

Regards,

Hi,

I have received a question related to this, so I assume there ARE use-cases=
 where multiple REFERs are sent within a single dialog (sorry, I don't have=
 any detailed information about the use-case available).

The question is: since REFER is a target refresh request, is it allowed to =
send a new REFER request (within the same dialog) before you have received =
the 202 response to the previous REFER?

Call-flow:

UAC                          UAS

  --------- REFER (1) -------->

  --------- REFER (2) -------->

  <-------- 202 (1) -----------

  <-------- 202 (2) -----------


I don't know whether there is a problem from a transfer perspective, but as=
 far as I understand it is now allowed to issue a new target refresh reques=
t one there is one pending.

Regards,

Christer

What Robert said.

Perhaps it is possible that the operation requested by the first refer fail=
s, and is notified, but does not *immediately* terminate the subscription. =
(Not that I can think of a reason why.) Then the requester might try anothe=
r refer and get a second subscription before the first goes away.

In the usual way of things, you should probably try to avoid creating such =
a situation, unless you have some as yet unknown good reason. But if you ar=
e on the receiving side you should do the right thing if it happens to you.

RFC 3261 says that overlapping non-Invite transactions are allowed and REFE=
R RFC is silent on it, but imo, the UAC should be discouraged from doing so=
. Overlapping transactions are application dependent and there is no one ru=
le which applies to all usage.
Having said that, I am not sure if call flow below is a problem. Since UAS =
will not update the remote target until it has sent a final response and UA=
C should not assume that the remote target is updated until it has received=
 that final response. So even if second Refer contains an updated remote ta=
rget, it will update the previous one.

Sanjay

A reminder that the chairs would like to receive the slide packs for the
Tuesday SIP session by close of play Monday, so we can post them.

For the Thursday session, close of play Wednesday would be essential to
enable us to post them.

If you don't get them to us on time, we'll still allow your slot,
WITHOUT SLIDES! We can investigate other possibilities, like allowing
your slides but making you sing the entire slide deck! Suggestions in
this area are also welcome.

Regards

Keith

Hi Rajeev,

The retention-expiry field in 4119 is an xml dateTime:
<xs:element name="retention-expiry" type="xs:dateTime"

The XMl dateTime is a standard XMl type defined in "W3C XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition
W3C Recommendation 28 October 2004".

The link for this document can be found here: http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/

The link to the dateTime definition can be found here http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime

When you sending and parsing, do you really mean creating?

Cheers
James

Hi,
 
RFC3261 specifies Date header in the following format:- 
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2008 12:01:08 GMT
 
RFC4119 specifes retention-expiry in the following format:-
   <gp:retention-expiry>2007-07-27T18:00:00Z</gp:retention-expiry>
 
This seems like another format for representing absolute time. 
 
Could somebody provide me info, on which RFC is this absolute time based
on.
 
Any idea how this can be implemented in Linux for sending and parsing.
 
Thanks.
Regards,
Rajeev

We've had a few threads over the last few months on the above topic. To 
refresh everyone's memory, the problem is how to deliver the original 
request-URI for a target to the UAS. Currently, a proxy will replace the 
R-URI with the registered contact, thus losing the original URI and any 
parameters. A bunch of use cases where this is needed have been identified:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-02.txt

The debate has been around whether to use the mechanism proposed in my 
draft above, which makes an architectural change to SIP to use loose 
routing to solve this. Alternative solutions are to use History-Info and 
to use a mechanism proposed by Christer:

http://www.watersprings.org/pub/id/draft-holmberg-sip-target-uri-delivery-01.txt

The threads seemed to general favor not doing my proposed UA loose 
route, and the issue was whether H-I is up to the job or whether to use 
the new thing proposed by Christer. The conclusion was that some kind of 
H-I extension was probably needed, but the debate was whether it was too 
complex and a more basic solution, like Christer has proposed, is better.

So, here is my compromise proposal on this:

1. we do NOT to UA loose route. Though I still think this is 
architecturally the best thing, I am convinced that its just too late 
for a change like this. Wish we had done this in 3261, but oh well.

2. We use H-I. However, remember that H-I can be used for many 
applications and those applications can define policies and usage rules 
to fit their needs. So, we can define a really, really simple usage such 
that, if all your proxy cares about is this problem, its basically no 
harder to implement than what Christer has proposed.

In particular, here would be the suggested algorithm:

For a proxy:

   If the proxy is rewriting the r-uri as a consequence of looking it up 
in a registration database, it looks at the incoming request. It removes 
any existing H-I values. It then adds two H-I values that look like this:

   History-Info: <sip:incoming-ruri>;target;index=1
                 <sip:outgoing-ruri>;target;index=1.1

and thats it. So really easy for a proxy.

For a UAS:

   The UAS looks through the H-I header field values in reverse order. 
There is no need to reorder them by index. It finds the first value with 
a target parameter. The corresponding URI will be the most recent target.


This algorithm in the UAS is compatible with a full HI implementation in 
a proxy as well; so this way, a proxy that just cares about target-uri 
delivery can do the simple thing above. One that wants everything 
ignores the policy above and implements the full spec. UA works in 
either case.

Of course this also requires us to extend HI with this new target URI 
param. It indicates that the URI is a request target. The above 
algorithm tries to provide an implementable way to at least positively 
assert that: that this URI is look-up-able in a registration database. 
It therefore is most likely a target for the request.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Last I looked, RFC 3459 fully specifies what to do with multipart/ 
alternative and multipart/related. We did not bother to enumerate what  
to do with multipart/mixed, as it is painfully obvious: one has to  
look at everything to figure out what to do. Sometimes, life is "less  
than ideal."

Like all things Mail (and SIP), handling does not require  
understanding.  What part of the original intention is not clear?   
Both 3204 and 3459 are gateway (B2BUA) scenarios.  3204 is a  
particular instance, while 3459 is the generic use case; mail focused,  
true, but appropriate for SIP, too.

On Keith's point that body-handling updates 3204, that works for me if  
this draft updates the rules for ISUP.  However, if it updates the  
meaning of "handling", then it is 3459 that gets the update, as 3459  
updates 3204 already.

Unfortunately for me, I only have a copy of draft-ietf-sip-body- 
handling-01 handy, so I cannot comment on -02 until this week.

Hi, =


>RFC 3261 says that overlapping non-Invite transactions are allowed and REF=
ER RFC is silent on it,

Yes, but I wonder whether there are more strict rules for target refresh re=
quests. =


>Having said that, I am not sure if call flow below is a problem. Since UAS=
 will not update the remote target until it has =

ll update the previous one.

Yes, but if the first 202 contains a new remote target, I guess the intenti=
on is that it should be used for future requests - including the second REF=
ER.

Christer

Last I looked, RFC 3459 fully specifies what to do with multipart/ 
alternative and multipart/related. We did not bother to enumerate what  
to do with multipart/mixed, as it is painfully obvious: one has to  
look at everything to figure out what to do. Sometimes, life is "less  
than ideal."

Like all things Mail (and SIP), handling does not require  
understanding.  What part of the original intention is not clear?   
Both 3204 and 3459 are gateway (B2BUA) scenarios.  3204 is a  
particular instance, while 3459 is the generic use case; mail focused,  
true, but appropriate for SIP, too.

On Keith's point that body-handling updates 3204, that works for me if  
this draft updates the rules for ISUP.  However, if it updates the  
meaning of "handling", then it is 3459 that gets the update, as 3459  
updates 3204 already.

Unfortunately for me, I only have a copy of draft-ietf-sip-body- 
handling-01 handy, so I cannot comment on -02 until this week.

I've occasionally required noncompliant presenters to wear a large  
rubber chicken tied about their necks during their talks. Does anybody  
have a chicken?

Yes, I have six, but as they are alive, I cannot bring them to  
Ireland :-)

The IESG has approved the following document:

- 'Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol 
   (SIP) '
   <draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-03.txt> as a Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working 
Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Cullen Jennings and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-03.txt

Technical Summary 

This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this
method can be used to refer servers to multiple resources. These
extensions include the use of pointers to Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI)-lists in the Refer-To header field and the "multiple-refer" SIP
option-tag. 

Working Group Summary 

The document was originally produced by the SIPPING working group, 
but was  transferred to the SIP working group due to the need to 
define a new option  tag, in conformance with RFC 3427. There
is consensus in the WG to publish this document. 

Document Quality 

There is a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution in this area. 

Personnel 

Keith Drage is the document shepherd for this document. 
Cullen Jennings is the responsible Area Director.

Note to RFC Editor
 
In the first paragraph of the Introduction:
OLD:
    RFC 3261 (SIP) [RFC3261] is extended by RFC 3515 [RFC3515] with a
    REFER method that allows a user agent to request a second user agent
    to send a SIP request to a third party.  Still, a number of
    applications need to request this second user agent to initiate
    transactions towards a set of destinations.

NEW:
    RFC 3261 (SIP) [RFC3261] is extended by RFC 3515 [RFC3515] with a
    REFER method that allows a user agent to request a second user agent
    to send a SIP request to a third party. For example, if Alice is in a
    call with Bob, and decides Bob needs to talk to Carol, Alice can
    instruct her SIP user agent to send a REFER request to Bob's user
    agent providing Carol's SIP Contact information. Assuming Bob has
    given it permission, Bob's UA will attempt to call Carol using that
    contact. That is, it will send an INVITE request to that contact.

    A number of applications need to request this second user agent to
    initiate transactions towards a set of destinations.

Hi James,

Thanks for this good info. 

Sending (the endpoint sending the XML to another SIP UA) - Any Linux OS
system calls (C/C++) available which can be used for constructing the
date in the xs:dateTime format expected by retention-expiry field.

Receiving- Any Linux system calls which can be used to parse the
xs:dateTime format.

Regards,
Rajeev

Hi Rajeev,

The retention-expiry field in 4119 is an xml dateTime:
<xs:element name="retention-expiry" type="xs:dateTime"

The XMl dateTime is a standard XMl type defined in "W3C XML Schema Part
2: Datatypes Second Edition W3C Recommendation 28 October 2004".

The link for this document can be found here:

When you sending and parsing, do you really mean creating?

Subject: [Sip] Question on format of retention-expiry (absolute time)
inRFC4119 (Presence-based GEOPRIV Location)
 
Hi,
 
RFC3261 specifies Date header in the following format:-
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2008 12:01:08 GMT
 
RFC4119 specifes retention-expiry in the following format:-
   <gp:retention-expiry>2007-07-27T18:00:00Z</gp:retention-expiry>
 
This seems like another format for representing absolute time. 
 
Could somebody provide me info, on which RFC is this absolute time based
on.
 
Any idea how this can be implemented in Linux for sending and parsing.
 
Thanks.
Regards,
Rajeev

Good news: #5 exactly the mechanism RFC 5022 uses.  Brilliant (or  
toasted) minds think alike.

Bad news: it does not solve the interoperability problem in its  
entirety. It means that the MSCML endpoints are sure they understand  
each other. However, if some one *also* does Cisco DTMF INFO, there is  
no way of signaling that, or that a particular INFO message is MSCML  
or DTMF, other than for the fact the Content-Type *hopefully* will be  
different.

Note Content-Type is not enough to solve the problem in the abstract,  
although it works for the known usages.  That means I would NOT  
advocate relying on Content-Type to disambiguate INFO messages.

Rajeev,

There are heaps of standard C libraries that deal with time to strings and vice versa, do a little hunting.

Cheers

Hi James,

Thanks for this good info. 

Sending (the endpoint sending the XML to another SIP UA) - Any Linux OS
system calls (C/C++) available which can be used for constructing the
date in the xs:dateTime format expected by retention-expiry field.

Receiving- Any Linux system calls which can be used to parse the
xs:dateTime format.

Regards,
Rajeev

Hi Rajeev,

The retention-expiry field in 4119 is an xml dateTime:
<xs:element name="retention-expiry" type="xs:dateTime"

The XMl dateTime is a standard XMl type defined in "W3C XML Schema Part
2: Datatypes Second Edition W3C Recommendation 28 October 2004".

The link for this document can be found here:
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/

The link to the dateTime definition can be found here
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime

When you sending and parsing, do you really mean creating?

Cheers
James

Hi,
 
RFC3261 specifies Date header in the following format:-

RFC4119 specifes retention-expiry in the following format:-
   <gp:retention-expiry>2007-07-27T18:00:00Z</gp:retention-expiry>
 
This seems like another format for representing absolute time. 
 
Could somebody provide me info, on which RFC is this absolute time based
on.
 
Any idea how this can be implemented in Linux for sending and parsing.
 
Thanks.
Regards,
Rajeev

If we do a registry for "Bad INFO" usage, I would offer we call it a  
catalog.  My strong preference is NOT to have an IANA registry, as  
that looks like a protocol.  My personal opinion is such a catalog  
(registry) is actually a BAD thing.  If you think Individual  
Informational RFC's get misinterpreted, just wait until we build an  
INFO Registry.

I'm confused.  Why is it removing any existing HI values?  Doesn't that break its compatibility with legacy HI usage?

I don't think it needs to remove them, although the policy of some
proxies might do that. The algorithm for backing up through the
History-Info is not that complex. I think it would be useful to show an
example that has the required entries to support "target", but also
contains "complete" (as possible) HI.

Yeah, that was exactly my concern. 

It should ADD the entries to the existing History-Info if
present.

Hi,

an open issue in the following draft is how to handle multipart/related:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-02.txt

The draft currently recommends to follow the original multipart/related 
spec [RFC 2387]:

    Per [RFC2387], a
    UA processing a 'multipart/related' body processes it as a compound
    object ignoring the disposition types of the body parts within it.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2387.txt

However, there have been some discussions about SIP needing to take into 
account the disposition types of the body parts. The following draft 
illustrates why you need to take into account the body parts' 
disposition types to distinguish between XCAP diff and a resource list:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roach-sip-list-subscribe-bodies-00.txt

An example of a SIP extension that already uses multipart/related is:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4662.txt

The current proposal is to specify that, in SIP, the content disposition 
of the body parts within a multipart/related need to be considered. The 
difference between multipart/mixed and multipart/related would be that 
multipart/related would be used when the different body parts are 
related to each other through a root body, as opposed to unrelated body 
parts.

If nobody has a problem with this, we will be updating the draft 
accordingly. We will probably moving the multipart/related stuff to a 
different section, since now it appears in the guidelines section.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Well if this is the case, then it should have added its own reference to
the IANA registration of the handling parameter, which it did not.
Suggest therefore that sip-body-handling also updates the IANA registry
to include RFC 3459 as well as its own RFC number.

The whole issue of target refresh seems filled with potential race =

conditions and ambiguities. The second REFER before the first is =

complete presents no new issues compared to a second SUBSCRIBE before a =

first is complete, and that is a much more likely case, especially with =

differing event packages.

The semantics of target refresh have always troubled me. Presumably =

there must be some period of time during which both the old and new =

addresses are valid. But when does that period end? And what if you are =

making the change because the old address stopped working already?

I think having such a mechanism will add to the confusion and for the reaso=
ns you mentioned above, will be difficult to implement. I think a better ap=
proach will be to forbid sending overlapping target refresh request until t=
he previous one is complete, as per the rules in RFC 5057.

That doesn't solve the problem. Even if you add that restriction, there =

are issues with:
- non-target-refresh requests that might be sent
- *previously sent* requests that don't get replies and need to be =

retransmitted
- retransmission of responses to earlier requests when a retransmission =

of the request is received.

So these issues either need to be clarified, or will remain ambiguous.

Agree here.

I was just trying to say, "hey, if you don't care or don't want anything 
but this basic usage of HI, this is what you'd do". A spec would say 
something like MAY remove or MAY append. Main thing is, if you append, 
you do need to check to make sure the incoming RURI is not already 
there, and if it is, add the target attribute. So its simpler if you 
just remove everything and re-add, but destroys other usages of HI.

A final update to the status before the SIP WG starts tomorrow. Slides
will be available on the presentation site, but we will not be
presenting any of the material in these slides.

If you have questions then please feel free to arrange this at the
agenda bash.

Changes since last version: 

-	multiple-refer is IESG approved.
-	publication requested on outbound.
-	WGLC initiated on DTLS framework

I would note that we expect 5 of the documents in WGLC to move forward
to publication request fairly shortly.

Regards

Keith

I believe those should be restricted as well. If a target refresh request h=
as been sent which is pending and the successful response to it will indica=
te what the current remote target is, then an application is better off wai=
ting the outcome of that request.

Use current remote target, but there may be race conditions. I am inclined =
to say that UA should not initiate another transaction (target refresh or o=
therwise) if another is pending.

>- retransmission of responses to earlier requests when a =

>retransmission of the request is received.
That will be a transaction layer thing, right, which will just retransmit t=
he last response.

Sanjay,

So I gather you are suggesting that after sending a target refresh =

request, the UA should refrain from sending anything else until a =

response is received. This is in spite of the fact that there is in =

general no reason to believe that the response will change the target. =

(While it *might*, this would in general be a race condition. It it was =

going to change its address it would be sending its own target refresh =

unless you catch it at *just* the right time.)

Probably the most likely scenario for this kind of problem is with =

NOTIFY. There are potentially lots of cases where it might want to send =

another NOTIFY quickly after a first one. I'm very reluctant to say that =

it MUST not.

In general I think we can say you SHOULD NOT send a 2nd request of any =

sort while another is outstanding, because request reordering can cause =

one to fail due to CSeq ordering problems. The potential target refresh =

issues are another justification for this, but probably not worse.

What I think is lacking is any normative statement of what a UA that has =

just offered a change to its address is to do regarding requests =

arriving on the old one.

Ok. I think it should be a SHOULD append.

At today's SIP meeting, the room strongly felt that progressing parts  
of SIP to Draft standard is not helpful at this time.

We will continue discussion on whether to continue down the path we've  
been on for some time, maintaining SIP through the essential  
correction process or biting off the very large task of a SIP-bis.  
(Much of the room felt like a SIP-bis would be useful, but recognized  
the arguments we would have to have, and finding the people to do the  
editing work would be really difficult).

However that conversation goes, the room felt proceeding with the  
interoperability/implementation report was worth doing now. To that  
end, I'd like to ask again that everyone review the list of statements  
in the draft and make sure they're at the right level and complete.

I'm going to set up a series of calls in August/September to work on  
finishing the list of statements. If you have time to help, please  
send me a note, and preferably at least statement to add to the list  
(or refine one of the statements that are already there).

this was the question Ted started, but wasn't asked of the room, 
i.e., who has "some" time to help in writing this.  The question that 
was asked is "who has the cycles to write this", as if an editor was 
to be assigned today...

Throughout the ongoing discussions, and in particular at today's
meeting, I seem to encounter two separate, IMO flawed arguments.

Flawed argument 1:
RFC 4474 is not just for securing the DTLS-SRTP certificate fingerprint,
but also for securing any sort of SIP request, which might not even be
session-related (e.g., MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE). Therefore we can't change
what is signed, because that would break these other usages, and even to
some extent it would break its usage with requests that do contain SDP
but do not involve DTLS-SRTP.

This is flawed, because it does not accept the possibility of signing a
different set of data when using DTLS-SRTP, whereby we ensure that
important things like the certificate fingerprint and codecs get signed,
but not things that might legitimately change en route, such as IP
addresses and ports. In other words, SIP requests carrying DTLS-SRTP
certificate fingerprints do not have the same requirements on integrity
protection as other SIP requests.

Flawed argument 2:
The problem exists when we go through service providers. Service
providers use only E.164-based SIP URIs. We can't do anything about
E.164-based SIP URIs. Therefore we can't do anything to address the case
where the request goes through service providers. Therefore there is
nothing we can do.

This is flawed because it doesn't recognise the possibility of sending
both an email-style SIP URI and an E.164-based URI (SIP or tel), whereby
the former is authenticated, along with integrity protection of
appropriate parts of the message, and the latter is not (and hence can
be changed by intermediate domains). For example, email-style in From
and E.164-based in PAI.

Comments?

Well, I was the one who offered an argument of this type, but it's
not quite what I'm saying.

Rather, I'm saying that Identity is not only to allow DTLS-SRTP, but
also to protect other usages, so if your proposal involves changing
fields which would render those other usages insecure, we have a
potential problem. For instance, as I understood Hadriel's comments at
the mike, he thinks he should be able change Call-Id in
non-offer/answer cases.  Before we consider that, we would need a
security analysis of the impact of changing Call-iD.

Hmm, I don't think anyone made quite that argument. Personally, I'd  
rather spend time thinking about the problems that were presented  
today in the meeting than repeat previous discussions.

Yup.  In particular, I'm claiming that we should sign something else to provide cut/paste protection rather than the call-id and cseq header fields.
I say that because I believe 4474 is signing them for the purpose of cut/paste type protection, not because we actually care whether the call-id/cseq values are changed by a MitM.

Yup, and CSeq, and Contact.

I believe that the problem statement (and associated use cases) that John presented in the WG session are valid.  I think it was unfortunate that those use cases couldn't be discussed more in the WG session.  This email appears to me simply John trying to further the discussions to bring out arguments.

One particular note I would like to share - given a comment at the mic regarding 4474 working as designed and desired - is that there are situations (good, bad or indifferent) that necessitate changes in the SDP. John cited media steering as a use case. Another use case is media steering for transcoding.  Use case below:

Ent A--->SSP1--->Ent B

In this use case, Ent A and SSP1 have established certain "rules of engagement", like G729, 2833, t.38, etc.  Ent B and SSP1 have established their own "rules of engagement", for instance G711 for voice, inband DTMF/FAX, etc.  Being there's no common denominator for the media, the SDP in INVITE "steers" to a device that can trancode.

Another use case, would be for those SSPs that have Lawful Intercept requirements. Steering the media to something that will can intercept should that be a regulatory obligation.

Cullen,
I think there was some confusion or miscommunication - it was my impression that what you asked for previously was for just *one* use-case/scenario where 4474 doesn't work the way we'd like, so the WG could focus on that one case and decide if it's legitimate to drive for a different mechanism.  I think that's why John presented just one case.  But at the mic it sounded more like you wanted to know *all* scenarios we thought should be handled.

Which is it?

This is more that sterring; the media is being terminated at a device  
that transcodes it. Then a new media stream flows out the other side.

When media transcoding is occurring, media integrity is hop-by-hop. I  
maintain that we have no need for an end-to-end identity  
representation when the media itself is hop by hop.

Same as above. Although one should note that proper use of DTLS-SRTP  
to detect the lawful intercept.

This is handled better if one of the UAs arranges for the transcoding, 
as specified in the RFC (number escapes me) that describes that.

Then, any integrity issues about the media are at the discretion of the 
UA that set it up. And in this case it presents no identity or signing 
issues.

(As WG cochair)

If you look at our charter page at:

http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/sip-charter.html

You will see we have now gained two new milestones for INFO packages as
follows:

Feb 2009    INFO package framework to WGLC (PS)  
Apr 2009    INFO package framework to IESG (PS)  

Hadriel Kaplan has "volunteered" to act as editor for the deliverable to
meet these milestones, and as agreed in the WG meeting the basis for
developing the -00 of this deliverable will be:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-sip-info-events-01.txt

There are a number of TBD in this document, and I am sure people have
text they think should also be in this document, either from other
internet drafts that formed part of the discussion so far, or other new
material.

Please feel free to post to the list to help move this work forward, and
close Adam's "festering sore".

Regards

Keith

Adam,

Thanks for your support. However, I do not accept transcoding as a use
case. To perform transcoding the service provider needs to decrypt and
re-encrypt, and therefore DTLS-SRTP will be terminated at the
transcoder. Therefore the service provider will indeed need to re-sign
the SIP request (the certificate fingerprint will have changed, among
other things), and the user will see that media is secure only as far as
the service provider. I think this is the correct outcome.

John

[JRE] Media steering is sufficient to accomplish LI. The encrypted
stream is delivered to the authorities. The authorities need to go to
the end domain to be able to have access to the encryption key and/or
the unencrypted stream. An intermediate domain cannot be held
responsible for encryption done by end domains.

Hello.

I have following problem:

For example, UAC decides to send INVITE via TCP transport and does
it like so:

INVITE sip:echo@sipnet.ru SIP/2.0
Call-ID: e271e3d45ca69c0a
CSeq: 1 INVITE
From: "user" <sip:test@192.168.1.4>;tag=1e5f7ab5
To: <sip:echo@sipnet.ru>
Via: SIP/2.0/TCP 192.168.1.4:5060;branch=z9hG4bKce32ffc97438620028ba85a78311d3cb
Max-Forwards: 70
Contact: <sip:test@192.168.1.4:5060>
Content-Type: application/sdp
Content-Length: 227

Then OK is receivied and it looks like so

SIP/2.0 200 OK
Via: SIP/2.0/TCP
192.168.1.4:5060;branch=z9hG4bKce32ffc97438620028ba85a78311d3cb;received=192.168.1.4

From: "user" <sip:test@192.168.1.4>;tag=1e5f7ab5
To: <sip:echo@sipnet.ru>;tag=000000000518036-57737A9D_lnqxjfk-660DE7A8
Call-ID: e271e3d45ca69c0a

Allow: INVITE,ACK,BYE,CANCEL,OPTIONS,INFO,MESSAGE,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,PRACK,REFER
Content-Type: application/sdp
Content-Length: 193

Then ACK is sent to URI that is defined in Contact header:

Contact: <sip:test@192.168.1.4:5060>
Content-Length: 0


Should this ACK be sent via TCP or UDP, whether URI in Route header
does not explicitly defines transport?

Andrey,

An ACK for a 2xx INVITE response should be sent out in the same way as
any other in-dialog request - meaning in this case it would be direct
to the IP address over UDP unless "rules of SIP define otherwise" (per

Technically, you can send the ACK with either TCP or UDP.

>From RFC 3261, you can use UDP upto a certain message size:

   If a request is within 200 bytes of the path MTU, or if it is larger
   than 1300 bytes and the path MTU is unknown, the request MUST be sent
   using an RFC 2914 [43] congestion controlled transport protocol, such
   as TCP. If this causes a change in the transport protocol from the
   one indicated in the top Via, the value in the top Via MUST be
   changed.  This prevents fragmentation of messages over UDP and
   provides congestion control for larger messages.  However,
   implementations MUST be able to handle messages up to the maximum
   datagram packet size.  For UDP, this size is 65,535 bytes, including
   IP and UDP headers.

Each transaction's transport is determined independently,
If the ACK does not exceed MTU(as in this case probably), it would be
sent via UDP given the ip address presented as route.

As per RFC3263

4.1 Selecting a Transport Protocol
  if no transport protocol is specified, but the TARGET is a
   numeric IP address, the client SHOULD use UDP for a SIP URI, and TCP
   for a SIPS URI. 

And you can also check out draft-ietf-sip-record-route-fix,
Sec 6.  Usage of Transport protocol parameter
Which has detail discussion on this issue.

What was clear from the SIP meeting is we have a communication problem.  We
have several drafts describing the problems.  We have several drafts proposing
solutions to those problems.  We spend time in SIP meetings discussing the
drafts.  

I have no understanding of the objections to John Elewll's scenarios that he
presented.


Cullen and Jon -- as individual contributors and as the authors of RFC4474 --
are you able to provide information to resolve this communication problem?

The point that I want to make is this - I think that end-to-end identity is important. John and Hadriel have pointed out problems with the methods available to attain end-to-end identity.  This is an important issue to address. Those intermediary devices are not only there to address a SSP subscriber's policy for termination or origination services, but also for just plain interoperability.

Is this an ATTACK though? I don't think it is.

One of the points of dispute at the mic is whether or not 'unauthorized' 
changes to signaling constitute an attack or not. I don't think we have 
a very clear definition of what aspects of the request are really and 
truly ones that are authorized to be changed, and which are not. We've 
tried to draw this line at headers/body and also outline certain headers 
which are and are no immutable. However, those were based on the model 
of which parts of SIP a PROXY needed to modify and which it didn't, NOT 
based on whether a modification of that header would truly be an attack.

I would assert that the following is an important litmus test:

   Modification of a portion of the SIP message is an 'attack' if
   and only if it results in an experience for the end user which defies
   their expectations.

Put in the contrapositive, if a change is not noticeably by the end 
users because they get exactly what they expected, then its not an 
attack. Nothing bad happened, so why would it be an attack?

Another way to think about this, is the following litmus test, "If an 
intermediary consistently makes this modification, is it likely that 
some users will open trouble tickets with their IT department to report 
a problem?". If so, the modification is an attack. If not, its not.

Modifying a message to cause it to be dropped clearly is an attack, 
since user expectation is that, if I make a call, it succeeds. So if a 
packet is consistently dropped, my calls consistently fail, which defies 
my expectations.

As another example that is more complicated, consider changing codecs. 
In one way, codecs are invisible to users. Indeed, a change of codec for 
purposes of transcoding will allow a call to succeed when it might 
otherwise fail, and is thus beneficial to users and not harmful. 
However, a downgrade of codecs - for example, removing wideband codecs 
from a codec list - is harmful and noticeable to users. If I have a 
softclient with iSAC and I call someone else who does too, but we get 
only g729, frankly, this is noticeable to the users. Indeed, one can 
imagine that if a user of such a soft client sometimes gets wideband and 
sometimes not, they may ask the person on the other end of the call if 
they also have a softclient with the wideband feature, and if that 
person does, not understand why there was no wideband for the call. In 
this case, modifications of codecs can be considered an attack without 
some indication to the user why they are not getting wideband.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

John,

Thank you for the comments on ua-privacy draft.

See inline.

 > 1. I think there should be something pointing out the limitations of
 > GRUU for obtaining an anonymous contact URI.

Will add the text to mention it.

 > A temporary GRUU will still
 > reveal the issuing domain, i.e., the domain with which the user
 > registers. For the From URI we specify sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid
 > (except where SIP Identity is used), but I don't see the point in this
 > if Contact reveals the domain.

That's true.  There is no point to conceal the user's
domain name in the From header if the same domain name
appears in the Contact header.

However, there is an option to use a third-party GRUU server
to get a temp-gruu that doesn't reveal the use's domain name.

Anyway, the user's domain name is not considered as
critical privacy-sensitive information in this draft.
So it should be concealed only if that doesn't ruin more
important functions such as routing and authentication.

Will fix the text to explain the above clearly.

 >
 > 2. In section 5.3, I think there should be a statement about sending the
 > SIP request to the relay server.

Will add such a statement.

 >

I mean that UA should conceal the user's host name
if that doesn't cause a problem.
Will fix the text.

I have to confess that my detailed review was sacrificed for other  
things.

Based on my past reviews and my understanding of the most recent  
changes, I'm comfortable with the draft proceeding and will do another  
detailed review during IETF LC. (I _really_ don't expect to find  
anything but nits at this point).

RFC 4474 provides quite strong assurances that the intermediaries have  
acted appropriately.

Some of the things that RFC 4474 block some of the actions of SBCs and  
some other intermediaries. Thus, we have a call to reduce the strength  
of RFC 4474.

If we water-down RFC 4474 to the point that an evil intermediary  
device could "gain advantage" in a way that RC 4474 would have  
prevented, then we have ruined RFC 4474.

Thus the argument that any SBC that changes SDP, etc. forms a  
transitive trust boundary, It MIGHT not have altered the identity, but  
it also might have, and there really is no way for the end node to  
tell. All it can really do is trust that it wasn't screwed over by the  
SBC.


So here's an idea: an alternative to RFC-4474 that explicitly supports  
transitive assertion identities by verifying an existing assertion and  
then asserting the same identity with a new signature.

We might start with RFC 474 and sign the same things as IFC 4474 does,  
but change a couple of points:

1) Instead of Identity and Identity-Info header fields, we'd use some  
new header fields (names TBD) to the identity that was verified and   
the signer. I propose "Reasserted-Identity" and "Reasserted-Identity- 
info"

2) Relax the requirement that the subject of the signing cert match  
the domain of the From. An SBC would still need a cert, but just the  
one, not one for every possible domain.

3) Replace 4474's discussion of authentication with a discussion of  
verification of an existing identity or Reasserted-Identity header  
field.

4) Add some History-Info extensions to add information about the  
reassertion into the history.

5) Add some flags somewhere to describe different levels of  
verification, such as a) Valid Identity header, b) Learned from PSTN,  
c) unverifiable Identity header, d) from P-Asserted-Identity, etc.



Here's an example:

1) alice@example.com calls bob@example.net

2) The example.com AS authenticates Alice using a mechanism such as  
proxy-authenticate, then adds an appropriate Identity and Identity- 
Info header field.

3) Bob's B2BUA verifies the Identity header field

4) Bob's B2BUA checks the Identity value value against Bob's whitelist  
and chooses to allow the call.

5) But Bob is out, so the B2BUA wants to forward the call to Bob's  
mobile phone. But Bob's administrative policy requires recording the  
call.

Since Bob's administrative policy requires  recording the call, Bob's  
b2bua steers the media through a recorder. This requires either  
"editing the SDP"  or termination of media on the SBC. in either case,  
it is not reasonable to send the existing Identity header on to Bob,  
since it's going to be broken.

6) Bob's B2BUA elides the previous Identity and Identity-Info and adds  
a new Reasserted-Identity and Reasserted-Identity-Info header  field  
to the new request, adds a flag saying that the identity being re- 
asserted was learned from a verified Identity header, then sends it.

7) Bob's mobile sees the new request, knows that it trusts Bob's B2BUA  
as a re-asserter, then checks its whitelist policy and finds that it  
is willing to accept calls from alice@example.com as long as the  
assertion strength is either a direct Identity or a re-asserted  
Identity based on verified Identity.

Part of the problem here is that the end user expectations have not been
rigorously defined for RFC 4474. Parts of RFC 4474 allow things that the
end user might not have expected, and so on.

Part of what was on the slides on Tuesday was to create some sort of
informational / BCP that does set out to detail what RFC 4474 and other
identity drafts provide, i.e. when an identity is delivered, this is the
security that is / is not associated with it.

If the end user can't tell the difference between a malicious  
application of the technique and a beneficial application of the  
technique, then the technique itself is  an attack vector and should  
be eliminated from the protocol.

Here's the problem... if I trust a B2BUA, it doesn't necessarily mean 
that I'll trust everything it trusts. If Bob's UA is going to make an 
informed choice, we need it to be able to examine a chain of custody for 
the identity, at the very least.

Thank you - this is the first description of a codec attack that
anyone has explained.

So a beneficial change (adding a codec and doing transcoding for
the user) is okay, but a non-benficial change (removing a good-
sounding codec for the end equipment [wideband] or for the network 
[iSAC]) is an attack?

That is not impossible, but the prime aim of what is proposed is a BCP
giving guidelines for usage of the existing documents. 

If requirements for new work fall out of this, then well and good, in
fact excellent - but that is more along the lines of the BCP discovers
(and documents) that the current behaviour is x and discussion of that
resolves that we actually need y then at that point we have identified a
requirement, which we will want to find some way to document.

Keith

Any transit service provider could do that today:  they can
claim their equipment is configured to validate incoming
RFC4474 signatures and will modify the From URI to their own
domain and generate their own RFC4474 signature.  They
can claim their equipment will only create RFC4474 signatures
for traffic that already had a valid RFC4474 signature.

The chain would be good, but I would be happy with the first link: 
who (claims to have) injected the message into the SIP network.  Even
if the message transited over some itty-bitty ITSP in a country I had
never heard of, it wouldn't matter if I could verify the identity of
who injected the message into the SIP 'cloud'.

sections  "6.1", "6.2", and "security considerations" (should I let this =

section like this or not?).

Sorry, I was a bit unclear. When I talk about this "chain of custody," I 
mean everything that has performed an action that would invalidate a 
4474 signature; everything that has had to re-sign something. Those are 
the actions that require a level of trust. As long as the ITSP you 
mention doesn't change 4474-protected fields, I don't care who they are.

Oh, so something like:  "The original list of codecs was G.729,G.711" and to
convey it in such a way that I could re-insert G.729 and validate the original
4474 signature?  And something like "The original m/c line was 1.2.3.4/5678"?

Yes, that has the right property -- enough information to reconstruct 
which changes were made, and by whom.

Hmm, well I think almost anything a proxy can legally do, can also be 
applied maliciously. For example, a proxy can:

* change the target of the request to someone not at all expected; e.g., 
I call the sales number for company 1 and it gets forwarded to company 2 
sales number. Frankly, this attack is far worse than any codec change.

* proxy can drop my requests and cause calls to fail

* proxy can insert via headers pointing to incorrect previous hops and 
launch dos attacks

* proxy can modify via fields, causing responses to bypass servers 
providing features, disrupting them

* proxy can discard record-routes in response; causing other servers to 
be bypasses for future requests. Consider the impact of this on a 
billing system that is built off another proxy which now never sees a BYE

and so on. My your metric, since I cannot differentiate legitimate from 
illegitimate uses of modification of these fields (rr, via, r-uri), all 
uses must be prevented.

Clearly this doesn't hold water.

Good point.  I guess you're saying a proxy can be evil, and
a B2BUA can be evil.

4474 only allows detecting if a proxy is evil, based on the
stuff that 4474 signs and considers important.

I (continue to) suggest that we need a way to detect if an
SBC is evil, based on stuff that is signed and is considered
important.

[JRE] I am not sure. But the important thing is that the user be aware
that there is intervention, i.e., that any media security is only as far
as the domain that does the conversion.

[JRE] But it is still transitive trust, but with the improvement
(compared to PAI) that at least you see the chain of transitive trust.
In that respect, isn't it similar to Hadriel's proposal?

Maybe one situation where this might have some utility is the case where
the intermediary intervenes in the media in a way that involves
decryption, e.g., change of codecs, conference mixing, recording of the
clear media. In this situation we cannot do better than transitive
trust.

But for the case where media is encrypted e2e, identity authentication
needs to be e2e. I am uncomfortable with transitive trust, at least for
cases where one of the signers in the chain is an entity not known to me
or not trusted by me.

[JRE] As discussed at the meeting, for a small enterprise the domain
name is almost certainly critical. Somebody might guess the particular
caller, or maybe just knowing the name of the enterprise is information
you don't want to disclose. Even for a large enterprise, the caller
might be guessed if the callee only knows one person or a small number
of people from that enterprise. I would say that for an enterprise the
domain name is very likely to be critical privacy-sensitive information.
I agree that for a sizeable service provider it might not be critical.

I haven't been following outbound closely for awhile now. I hope I 
haven't just overlooked the answer to this question.

I recently received a question about implementing the ping/pong 
mechanism from outbound. So I went and looked to see exactly what the 
definition was. I come away having some questions:

Must a ping always be responded to with a pong? Or is the ping just 
there to solicit *some* response? Namely, if when the ping is received 
there is other output going on the connection, must a pong still be 
sent? (It will have to be when the is a message break of course.) It 
would seem that the presence of output is sufficient evidence that the 
connection is alive. (If the pong is required, then I guess we will have 
to hope that it doesn't take 10 seconds to send the current message that 
is going out. Normally that shouldn't be a problem.)

And, must the be a matching pong for every ping? If several pings are 
received before it is possible to send a pong, must a corresponding 
number of pongs be sent? Or only one? If I have received two pings 
before I can send pong, and I am required to send two pongs, then that 
will look like a ping. That would seem to be bad.

Or is it illegal to send multiple pings before receiving a pong?

	Thanks,
	Paul

I still don't buy it.  Honestly, exactly how much benefit does an attacker get by "downgrading" your codec?  If there is no benefit/motivation for an attacker, why is this a threat we care about?

Alternatively, there *is* motivation for removing codecs to *improve* your experience - this is in fact done right now in deployed networks, to force calls crossing low-bandwidth WAN links to use lower-bandwidth codecs (e.g., removing g711 in favor of g729, or re-re-ordering them in the m-line).  In those cases the removal is beneficial.

Funny you should mention that.

It's becoming increasingly clear that VBR codecs leak a fair
amount of information, even when they are encrypted [WBC+08].
So, if, for instance, you were planning to use a fixed-rate
codec and an attacker could force you into a VBR codec, that
might leak information.

If you don't want media intercepted by intermediaries - you need to use DTLS-SRTP+fingerprint or something which prevents interception, or at least prevents interception for the purpose of rendering.

Just because you send your media to an IP Address indicated in the SDP by the far-end UA does NOT mean it is not being intercepted.  RFC 4474 does NOT provide you with media authentication or prevent eavesdropping by signing SDP.  You're not losing something because you didn't have it to begin with.

Hi John;

  I understand for enterprise or SOHO, domain name itself
may give away who the caller is.

  We can add the text describing the implication of domain
name contained in the request for enterprise and SOHO
etc. And provide a workaround by using 3rd party Registrar
/ Proxy (anonymization service) OR we can suggest that
UA falls back to the use of privacy:header defined in
RFC3323, which doesn't ensure any assurance that you
get the privacy you desire but if there is a privacy service
along the signaling path sufficient privacy will be provided.

  I am content with suggesting the use of anonymization
service, but this will mean that depending on the call, UA
needs to distinguish the set of proxy/registrar to use based
on the user's intent/action (e.g. pushing anonymous button on the  
phone?).

  Any other suggestion for a workaround?

  Regards
   Shida

Fascinating paper. (truly)  But it sounds more like just a reason to fix SRTP for VBR, through random padding or whatever.

I haven't studied the problem, but I suspect random padding
is of limited use because it averages out. Probably better
to use a fixed length codec.

However, I think focusing on that misses the larger point: the UAC and
UAS have certain desires as expressed in the messages/SDP
To the extent to which we allow the intermediaries to change
those messages, we need to carefully analyze each instance,
and this analysis may actually depend on facts yet to be 
discovered.

4474 allows intermediaries to change SDP, and re-create a new

(which is the subject of this thread) *and* (b) allows 
intermediaries to perform the very downgrade attack you
cited ([WBC+08]).

This is why I want to improve upon 4474.

That was kinda my thought for the P-Asserter draft - as much as preventing all mitm cases would be great, not having anything is far worse.  Most of my customers don't care about preventing mitm for identity; if there's a malicious mitm, wrong identity is the *least* of their problems.  What they care more about (I think) is lying originators, open relays, and the like.

In other words they want to prevent SPAM and Phishing and such.  Having a proof of signaling originator Identity alone (ie, the From or something similar) with replay protection and non-repudiation is sufficient for them - they don't need SDP identity, or Call-Id Identity, or CSeq Identity.
