Yes, now I am clear with the MESSAGE concept of paging mode and session
mode.  Thank you for your information.  
Is there any specific restriction for how long a MESSAGE should be sent in
paging mode?

Yes, the UAC can send/convey information one way to the UAS.
This information flow feels like sending a message to a pager or sending an
sms to a mobile.

Hi,
In the SIP messaging specifications, the usage of MESSAGE is limited to
small, short messages while for longer messages like e.g. multi-media
messages including video, pictures etc. MSRP must be used instead.

MESSAGE has been retro-fitted with a capability that enables a user to
specify multiple destinations for a short message (see
draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-message-07). This capabilty needs a messaging
server that explodes the list of destinations and sends the short message to
each destination. However, SIP-based MSRP does not define that capability.
The INVITE that initiates the MSRP session cannot be targeted to mutiple
invitees by the inviting user. The UA must initiate the sessions
individually to each destination and then send the message to all the
destinations. This may lead to either more complex messaging client
implementations in UA or cumbersome usage in comparison to the short
messaging client.

One case where this lack of capability is notorious is in SMS/MMS/IMPS
interworking with IMS. When a GSM user sends an SMS to multiple destinations
this can be directly mapped by the interworking function to a MESSAGE
request including all the destinations in the request.

However, when a GPRS user sends an MMS to multiple destinations, the
interworking function must take care of initiating the SIP and MSRP
sessions, send the message over all sessions and then releasing those
sessions. The same goes for IMPS.

I think it would be advantageous to retro-fit session-based messaging with
the same capability as short messaging. One possible alternative would be to
allow the same MIME body defined in
draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-message-07 in INVITE requests for MSRP sessions.
However this may not seem appropriate since it impacts a rather basic
message of the SIP specification. Any other alternative would require
defining a new mechanism specific for long, multi-media messages, like e.g.
content indirection.

I wonder if there've been some discussions on this issue already? What's the
oppinion of the sipping community on it?

Best regards,

I'm not familiar with the details of MSRP, but I do not see why a forked
INVITE cannot carry an MSRP set-up offer to more than one destination, each
of which will reply with an MSRP set-up answer, thus setting up a set of
MSRP sessions.  (In exactly the same way that a single INVITE can establish
multiple SDP sessions.)

Oops, well, yes, you have to make sure the proxies that do the forking do
not attempt to cancel all-but-one successful branch of the fork.  But that's
a known problem that applies to a lot more situations than setting up MSRP
sessions.  See, e.g., draft-worley-sipping-forking-00 for a discussion,
especially section 3.6.

Beacuse MSRP is inherently session-oriented, I don't think you're going to
get around having to initiate and release SIP/MSRP sessions.

To simplify the internetworking function, perhaps what needs to be done is
to define a way for MSRP relays to act as URI-list services.  That way, the
internetworking function could:
1. Send a forked INVITE to all recipients 2. Gather responses and construct
URI-list 3. Send message and URI-list to URI-list Service The URI-list
Service could then forward the message to all the recipients and relay MSRP
REPORTs back to the internetworking function, who could then send BYE
requests to close the SIP sessions.  Given the constraints that MSRP is
session-oriented (hence requires initiation/release), I think that's about
as simple as it can get.
(Actually, adding such a URI-list capability to MSRP relays seems like a
good idea in general, since it would simplify the implementation of
multi-party chat.)

Hope this helps,

In RFC 3428, section 3, " MESSAGE requests do not establish dialogs".

 Does "Paging mode" mean that with out establishing a actual/voice session,
UA client can send IM to UA server?

There are 2 models in SIP for sending IMs (paging and session).

Paging mode has the UA client sending the MESSAGE method to pass the
information. Please refer to RFC 3428.

Session mode has the UA client sending the INVITE method to establish a
session first.

For SMS via SIP, the MESSAGE method carrying the text within the body of the
method to the SMSC (or application server) mimics 2G.

The establishment of a session via INVITE mimics IM where peer information
can be relayed, such as "typing".

   Thanks for the message.  But for MESSAGE conversation, what kind of
   codec is used, that is audio codec or any other specified codec?
   As per RFC 3551 Audio and video codecs are specified.

A MESSAGE request contains the text content directly.  See RFC 3438 for
details.  (I don't think anyone has specified how to carry recorded audio
segments as messages.)

For extended interchange of messages, as Fenar says, you set up a dialog
(using INVITE) and specify the use of MSRP in the SDP.

As others have noted, if you want to interoperage with 3GPP, its
specificaitons are available.

Hi,

While my email contained a lot of questions for you rather
than a clear proposal I am not sure if we interpret each
others opinion well enough to say we agree. Anyway to clarify
my opinion - I agree with the proposal given for the poll:

> Proposal 1: Make CRLF the only keepalive mechanism for TCP and TLS
> over TCP flow (retain STUN for UDP flows).
>
> Proposal 2: Make outbound registrations over UDP flows optional for
> UAs.
>
> Proposal 3: Include (in Outbound) the statement that its is
> RECOMMENDED that the outbound-proxy-set is configured to result in
> registrations over TCP or TLS whenever the UA can't accept incoming
> TCP flows.=20

Do you agree with that ?

As a summary what that would mean in terms of deployments:

- Every Outbound compliant (UA or proxy) implementation MUST=20
  support TCP but MAY support UDP too.

- It will be up to the deployment to select whether TCP or UDP
  (or even both) shall be used for that specific deployment.
  Supporting UDP only would have known limitations and it would
  also mean that TCP-only implementations could not be used for
  that deployment.

Erkki=20

Hi,

Me too: I also agree with #1 and #2. But when Outbound is used for
NAT traversal I do not find #3 to add any value to #1. Switchover to=20
TCP (in the presence of NAT) can only be used if the UA always keeps=20
the TCP alive like in #1. The additional UDP flow does not bring=20
any significant value for the deployment.

The only case where #3 might make some sense is that if 3GPP wants
to support multiregistration of a single UA over different radio
network types (cellular and WLAN) with Outbound. That use case=20
does not have anything to do with NAT traversal, so keepalives=20
would not be needed and switchover from UDP to TCP could be made=20
like in RFC 3261.=20

Regards,

Erkki=20

   Further assume that the Proxy added a Record-Route header to the
   SUBSCRIBE request.

The dialog is established by the first request, in this case
SUBSCRIBE.  The route-set of the dialog is established by the

Personally, I think that it would be better if Outbound-compliant
UAs (but not Proxies) also had to support UDP.

But I can certainly live with either decision.


> - It will be up to the deployment to select whether TCP or UDP
>   (or even both) shall be used for that specific deployment.

Correct. A SIP service provider could decide to support TCP or UDP
(or both) as they see fit for their deployment.

Since clients would support both, it would be entirely a service=20
provider decision.

>   Supporting UDP only would have known limitations and it would
>   also mean that TCP-only implementations could not be used for
>   that deployment.

To me, it's more a question of UDP not working in many cases where
fragmentation may be an issue.=20

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol Location Conveyance
	Author(s)	: J. Polk, B. Rosen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-06.txt
	Pages		: 35
	Date		: 2007-1-2
	
This document defines an extension to the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) to convey geographic location information from one 
   SIP entity to another SIP entity.  The extension covers end to end 
   conveyance as well as location-based routing, where proxy servers 
   make routing decisions based on the location of the UAC.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I've submitted the -06 version of Location Conveyance for review

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-06.txt

    This document defines an extension to the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) to convey geographic location information from one
    SIP entity to another SIP entity.  The extension covers end to end
    conveyance as well as location-based routing, where proxy servers
    make routing decisions based on the location of the UAC.

The changes from -05 to -06 are as follows:

    - cleaned up some inconsistencies wrt the S/MIME example in Section
      4.2

    - changed the ABNF to include the ability to indicate which SIP
      element inserted a particular location URI, and how a message
      routing server indicates which location the message was routed
      upon (based on the location in the message)

    - give examples of the above in section 5.3.1

    - changed the granular error code from a Reason header indication to
      a Warning code indication (section 3.4), and IANA registered 14
      new Warning codes in this document

    - As a consequence of the above bullet, changed the specific SIP
      element behaviors of each SIP element regarding sending or
      receiving a 424 response with a Warning header

    - Added rules about indicating which SIP element inserted a
      particular location into a message (a new Geolocation header
      parameter), as well as when a server adds another new header
      parameter indicating the request was routed based on a particular
      location included in the message

Please comment

James

May support UDP for Outbound, or may support UDP, period? Unless I'm
missing something somewhere, section 18 of RFC-3261 still says that all
SIP elements MUST implement UDP.

Dean,

Deployments don't need to support the Very Important Stuff you mention
below to see problems with UDP fragmentation across NATs. Just support
an event package with some honkin' XML sizes like presence, you'll see
it pretty quickly then.

I think the big problem in the UDP vs. TCP debate is that end customers
do not perceive the choice in transport protocol as being something that
provides them with significant value. Because of that, they don't push
their vendors to support it (as evidenced by the large amount of UDP
equipment running around out there) and the system engineering
requirements for TCP are viewed to be significantly different from UDP.

The reason I am pointing this out is because we're trying to fix the
problem by forcing people's hand's in the standard, which I believe is
ultimately going to fail. People will put in whatever they need to
continue to avoid the cost of developing proper TCP support until the
market demands TCP be supported (meaning that they can no longer avoid
the cost because they won't be able to deploy any equipment without it).

IMHO-- we should be flexible in this regard. Make sure that the UDP
behavior is at least minimally specified in the standard (warts and all)
and then work outside of standards with customers so that they fully
appreciate (and properly value) what they're getting with TCP that
they're not getting with UDP. At that point I think the whole debate
will resolve itself because the number of implementations wanting to use
UDP will drop.

Also, people should keep in mind that there are a panoply of access
network types out there. Some of them behave better with UDP than they
do with TCP because of the way the access network itself operates. If
you are thinking only in a CAT-5/6 world, there are other issues out
there that people may be up against that pushes them to use UDP. If I
have an access network that favors UDP in performance, and I know there
are no NATs between the client and the outbound proxy that have
fragmentation issues, it doesn't make sense to use TCP.

Regards,
Brian

i would think that the drop will be faster if there is no support for
UDP in outbound.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Indicating Support for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-ice-option-tag-00.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 2007-1-3
	
   This specification defines a media feature tag and an option tag for
   use with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The media feature
   tag allows a UA to communicate to its registrar that it supports ICE.
   The option tag allows a User Agent (UA) to require support for ICE in
   order for a call to proceed.

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message. 
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then 
"get draft-ietf-sip-ice-option-tag-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-ice-option-tag-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

As I said, there are networks where TCP is less efficient than UDP and
there are no NAT complications to be concerned about.

I don't think outbound is so fundamental to the operation of SIP as to
force people to change out their transport protocol to get the benefits.
There are other ways that people have been solving this problem without
the benefit of a standard. I doubt that dropping support for UDP is
likely to get them to move away from these mechanisms faster than if
they had support for outbound with UDP.

Regards,
Brian

i fully agree.  outbound doesn't give anything over what we have today.

the reason to drop outbound support from udp is there are problems with
outbound and udp as has been described on this list.

Sorry, I was not clear enough for my formulation.
The scope of my summary was the usage of SIP together
with Outbound, thus I simply meant this:

>May support UDP for Outbound

as a rewording of the original proposal:

> Proposal 2: Make outbound registrations over UDP flows optional for
> UAs.

Erkki

I am looking for a tool which shall help in automating third party
software(SIP Stack phone) like automating of buttons click on the soft
phones. It would be a great help if someone provides relevant details.

Thanks !

Hello,

For buttons clicks, I guess you can get sounds produced by softphones
and script a player to it :-)

Or, you can use miniua for sip calls scripting. Its documentation is
available there ->
http://dev.openwengo.com/trac/openwengo/trac.cgi/wiki/MiniUa


In the hope that help you,

Sebastien.

I just submitted a new version of my proposal to support hybrid TCP-UDP
 transport in Outbound.  Until it appears in the archives, a copy can be
found here:

http://marc.petit-huguenin.org/draft-petithuguenin-sip-outbound-fragmentation-01.txt

This is a nearly complete rewrite.  Please read at least the
Introduction and the Overview of Operation sections and you will see
that this proposal does not add a lot of complexity to Outbound.

Comments and questions are welcome.

Thanks.

(As WG chair)

Please be aware of the following draft submission.

While this is a new document in the SIP WG, the intention is that it
should enter WGLC at the same time as the main ice draft in the MMUSIC
WG has it's revised WGLC. This is believed to be imminent.=20

Now would therefore be a suitable time to review the document and
identify any major issues with the direction that it takes, and identify
any omissions that were expected to be covered by this draft, rather
than leaving such for the WGLC. Send comments to the author and to the
SIP WG list.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Indicating Support for Interactive
Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP)

   This specification defines a media feature tag and an option tag for
   use with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The media feature
   tag allows a UA to communicate to its registrar that it supports ICE.
   The option tag allows a User Agent (UA) to require support for ICE in
   order for a call to proceed.

James,

Here are some comments on the latest conveyance draft. I generally like 
the document, so it's mostly small stuff, but hopefully helpful, 
nonetheless.

First, you refer

Section 1: Introduction
----------------------------
 I have trouble understanding the last sentance of the first paragraph. 
Consider condensing the sentence. For example,
"We use the term "conveyance" to distinguish this work from other 
cirmustances in which location is used, such as location sighting or 
location configuration."
The above sentance might be too vague, another possibility:
"We use the term "conveyance" to distinguish this work from other 
circumstance in which location is used, such as the initial generation 
of location information or the acquisition of location information by 
the SIP entity."

Section 3.3: 424 Response Code
---------------------------------------
The final sentance of the final paragraph reads:
"An initial set of location error codes are in [ID-ERROR]"
I don't know if a concesus was reached regarding the future of the 
ID-ERROR (Geopriv error code registry draft).
 However, it seems that either:
- The reference to ID-ERROR should be removed because the ID-ERROR draft 
is not moving forward,
or else
- Additional text should be added to clarify the relationship between 
the error code registry draft and the new warning codes provided in 
Section 3.4

Section 3.4: New Warning Codes for Location Error Granularity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The final sentance of paragraph 2 should read:
"This can be useful for troubleshooting."  (added the word 'be')

Section 3.4.1
----------------
The third sentance reads: "... only understood location in RFC4119 
PIDF-LO format (civic or geo)."
In this context it may be unclear to the reader what you mean by "geo".
I'm not sure what you should call the format that's not civic, but it's 
important to be consistant (and as clear as possible).
In this document, you refer to "geo" in 3.4.1, "Geo-location Format" in 
3.4.2, and "Coordinate Format" in 4.1
Also, RFC 4119 refers to this format as GML 3.0, and the LoST drafts 
refer to this format as "Geodetic Coordinate".
So basically, I don't know how you should refer to this format, but 
using "geo" as short hand without defining it, may cause confusion.
(Also, consider adding a space between RFC and 4119.)

Next, in the 5th (second to last) sentence of the first paragraph, the 
'SHOULD' is capitalized, but in the last sentence the 'should' is not 
capitalized. My inclination is that since these are just examples, the 
'should' should not be capitalized in either case. However, if you want 
the text to be normative, you should captialize both occurances of 'should'

Section 3.4.3
----------------
In the second paragraph, the word 'Warning' probably does not need to be 
capitolized.

Section 3.4.4
----------------
The first sentance is missing a comma and should read:
"... means the location provided, whether by-value or by-reference, in a 
request is not well formed."

Section 3.4.5
----------------
I found the second paragraph to be unclear. Consider re-wording it as 
follows:
"A typical reaction to receiving this warning code is for the location 
sender to verify that it has indeed included location information in the 
request and then to send the request again."

Section 3.4.6
----------------
In the second paragraph, consider changing 'error' to 'warning code' for 
consistancy.

Section 3.4.7
----------------
Consider re-wording the second paragraph as follows:
"A typical reaction to receiving this warning code is for the location 
sender to convey more information, if doing so is allowed by local policy."

Section 3.4.12
-----------------
In the second paragraph, consider changing 'error' to 'warning code' for 
consistancy.

Section 3.6
--------------
In the last sentance of the first paragraph, consider adding a space 
between RFC and 3693.

I had trouble understanding the first sentance of the second paragraph. 
Consider a re-wording such as:
"... treating the URI as a presence URI and dereferencing it by sending 
a SUBSCRIBE request to a presence server as per [RFC3856]."

In the last sentance of the third paragraph, add the word 'is' before 
the phrase 'the purpose of this extension'

Section 5
-----------
In the fourth paragraph, add the word 'a' between 'for protecting' and 
'PIDF'

Consider rewording the first sentance of the last paragraph as follows:
"... in the same SIP message, so long as each is in a separate message 
body part."

Section 5.1
-------------
In the first sentance of the third paragraph, consider adding the phrase 
'or wish to convey' between 'does not know' and 'its location at this time'.

In sentance three of paragraph five, I find the phrase 'learn from the 
Warning code' to be unclear. Consider re-wording the sentance as follows:
"Upon receiving an error response, the UAC SHOULD take appropriate steps 
based on the warning code before attempting to convey location again."

I had trouble with the final paragraph of this section. I understand 
that if the UAC has a problem with location information sent by the UAS 
it doesn't have an oppertunity to send a warning code and should just 
ignore the information. However, you go on to say that "A subscription 
is a better means of getting a UAS's location". By 'a subscription' do 
you mean location-by-reference as opposed to location-by-value? Also, 
it's not clear why a subscription is a better way of obtaining the 
location of a UAS. Perhaps you could write a small amount of additional 
text clarifying this notion.

Section 5.2
--------------
Consider re-wording the first sentance of the first paragraph as follows:
"... is present, the type of URI contained in the header field will 
indicate if location ..."

In the first sentance of the second paragraph, consider changing "or 
error the message" to "or else send an error response"

Section 5.3
-------------
Consider re-wording the first sentance of the first paragraph as follows:
"Proxies that perform location-based routing may need to consult 
external databases or systems to determine the route."

Section 5.3.1
----------------
In the first sentance of the first paragraph, consider adding the word 
'geolocation' between 'any existing' and 'header'.

The first paragraph indicates that any existing header parameter MUST 
NOT be modified or deleted by a proxy. However, the last paragraph 
describes a case where the proxy MUST remove the incoming 
"message-routed-on-this-uri". If "message-routed-on-this-uri" is a 
header parameter than this is a contradiction. (Alternatively, if this 
is not a contradiction, then it's unclear to me what a header parameter is).

I don't. The problem is not that UAs don't support TCP. The problems  
is that proxies don't support TCP on a large scale. Now we have had  
some posts that it is possible to build proxies with lots of TCP  
connections but if people want to encourage the move to TCP, I think  
the best thing they could do is help people understand how to build  
large scale TCP proxies.

Hi,

I don't see value in goal #3.  I believe my proposal covers your goals
#1 and #2 (with #2 corrected to talk about receiving large packets as
corrected by Francois).

Perhaps you are having an allergic reaction to some of the specific
wording I proposed rather than the goal or effect of that text.  If
so, lets try to hammer out some mutually agreeable alternate text.

thanks,
-rohan

how can you from cisco say that the problem is not that UAs don't
support TCP, when UAs from cisco and its affiliates don't support TCP?

which popular proxies don't support TCP in large scale?  give me some
names.  if there are some, i'm sure their vendors must fix them, because
otherwise they would be out of business.

Hi,

In a recent prototype I had to emulate processing of a 302 response by a
SIP client by launching a script that actually dials the phone number
received in the Contact header of the 302 on the client's UI. The reason
was obviously that the client did not properly implement the re-dialling
on reception of the 302.

The tool I used is MacroExpress 3 and it worked pretty well.

Hope it is helpful,
/Javier

Can you elaborate what kind of networks these typically are? Do you mean
that the networks are configured to prioritize UDP in some DiffServ'ish
manner, or some more fundamental issues with retransmissions etc.=20

People often refer to TCP's inefficiency in the wireless access due to
non-congestion related packet loss. This can be an issue when
transfering large amounts of data. However, it is not relevant in case
of SIP/TCP where relatively short messages are sent back and forth.=20

Hi Javier,

Thanks lot for this information.
I have installed the Macro Express 3.
Need to play with this tool to know how key strokes can be automated.

My requirement is
1.	I have developed the test automation tool for SIP protocol conformance.
2.	Testing at present with SJPhone. SJPhone needs manual interaction for
accepting/rejecting the call and also to place the MT(Mobile Terminating) to
the Testing tool.
4.	We have close to 300 test cases. Manually accepting/rejecting and placing
call for these many test cases is becoming very difficult job.
Hence, I wanted to automate the SJPhone for
accepting/rejecting/call-placing. I can't write the stub as I don't have
interface document.

At present, I am not sure, whether all above things shall be taken care by
MacroExpress3.

Thanks !
Rathod.

Hi,

In a recent prototype I had to emulate processing of a 302 response by a
SIP client by launching a script that actually dials the phone number
received in the Contact header of the 302 on the client's UI. The reason
was obviously that the client did not properly implement the re-dialling
on reception of the 302.

The tool I used is MacroExpress 3 and it worked pretty well.

Hope it is helpful,
/Javier

Hi,

>Introduction and the Overview of Operation sections and you will see
>that this proposal does not add a lot of complexity to Outbound.

I quite much disagree and still think it is too complex.=20
The draft introduces the following pattern:

1. Proxy receives such a big SIP request that it can not pass it
   to the UA via the persistent UDP flow
2. Consequently the proxy will send ForceTCP message to the UA
3. The UA will open a temporary TCP connection towards the proxy
4. The UA will send a GetToken request to the proxy over the TCP
   connection
5. The proxy will respond GetToken with a new flow token assigned
   to the TCP flow
6. UA will store this new TCP flow token and associate it with the
   UDP flow
7. UA will respond to the ForceTCP message returning the flow token
   of the TCP flow to the proxy
8. Based on the response from the UA the proxy can now re-map the
   big SIP request from UDP flow to the new TCP flow and forward
   it to the UA

That does not sound too easy to me. Especially when thinking about:
- Various interactions between the SIP and STUN stacks required
- Requirement for the UA to start opening TCP connections when
  there is no SIP request to sent (a change to the connection
  management architecture laid out in RFC 3261).
- Usage of SigComp together with SIP and STUN muxed over a=20
  TCP connection, if the deployment requires using SigComp

I believe the proposed mechanism does not clearly describe to=20
which address and port the UA should set up its TCP connection.
Usually UA resolves the SIP URI of the next hop when sending
a request and opens the connection towards a resolved address-port
pair. In the context of ForceTCP at least the port is not evident.

If proxy has a TCP SIP port configured to the DNS, the UA might
already have a TCP connection open towards the proxy even if the
proxy does not recognize it. Instead of opening a new TCP connection
the existing one could be used, see below. But if DNS does
not have TCP SRV record for the proxy, then which port to use ?
Always 5060 or should ForceTCP tell the port number ?


But if you anyway would like to continue with the draft, please
consider an alternative pattern.

I believe that the requirement for the UA to associate the UDP and
TCP flows together does not make sense. The proxy should maintain
this association as it is the proxy who really needs this info,
in order to remap inbound requests between flows. Consequently
the pattern could be like this:

1. Proxy receives such a big SIP request that it can not pass it
   to the UA via the persistent UDP flow
2. Consequently the proxy will send ForceTCP message to the UA.
   This message would contain the flow token of the UDP flow.
3. UA would immediately respond to the ForceTCP message
4. The UA will open a temporary TCP connection towards the proxy
   or skip this phase if it already has a persistent TCP connection
5. The UA will send a GiveToken request to the proxy over the TCP
   connection, giving the token of the associated UDP flow
6. The proxy will respond GiveToken request and store the mapping
   between the TCP and UDP flows
7. Based on the GiveToken from the UA the proxy can now re-map the
   big SIP request from UDP flow to the TCP flow and forward
   it to the UA

This pattern would also avoid ForceTCP transaction to time out
(or retransmissions of ForceTCP) while UA is opening the TCP
connection and performing the GetToken exchange.


P.S. I still have doubts whether this mechanism, introduced as a=20
separate draft, would gain wide enough acceptance to be really
useful for deployments. I also anticipate that when reviewed in
detail, the complexity will grow as the problems and different
error cases etc. pop up.


Regards,

Erkki

Why would these nodes send larger INVITEs than e.g. normal UAs? I would
claim that in many cases it could be the other way around...

I don't think we should rule out scenarios multiregistration with
Outbound in NAT environments. TISPAN has also been looking at Outbound
for certain multiregistraion scenarios.

That may also affect the deployment speed of outbound, and people will
continue to use whatever mechanisms they are currently using.

I pretty much agree with Brian. The market will decide what transport is
most suitable. By supporting both UDP and TCP outbound provides a
mechanism that works both today and tomorrow (when the SIP messages
become too big for UDP, and people realize they must switch to TCP in
order to get something to work).

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I think that proxies should support both TCP and UDP.

what is wrong with that as long existing mechanism work and don't
require any standardization?  is there some ietf religion here?

regarding tcp, outbound should not specify one single mandatory
mechanism for keepalives.  for example, if SIP UA support tcp
keepalives, it should be allowed to use them without sending any
application level data (stun or crlf).

Probably :)

But, the reason I like outbound is because I think it's a TECHNICALLY
good solution, and more flexible than many of the existing mechanisms.

Yes.

Hi Javier,

Thanks lot for this information.
I have installed the Macro Express 3.
Need to play with this tool to know how key strokes can be automated.

My requirement is
1.	I have developed the test automation tool for SIP protocol conformance.
2.	Testing at present with SJPhone. SJPhone needs manual interaction for
accepting/rejecting the call and also to place the MT(Mobile Terminating) to
the Testing tool.
4.	We have close to 300 test cases. Manually accepting/rejecting and placing
call for these many test cases is becoming very difficult job.
Hence, I wanted to automate the SJPhone for
accepting/rejecting/call-placing. I can't write the stub as I don't have
interface document.

At present, I am not sure, whether all above things shall be taken care by
MacroExpress3.

Thanks !
Rathod.

Hi,

In a recent prototype I had to emulate processing of a 302 response by a
SIP client by launching a script that actually dials the phone number
received in the Contact header of the 302 on the client's UI. The reason
was obviously that the client did not properly implement the re-dialling
on reception of the 302.

The tool I used is MacroExpress 3 and it worked pretty well.

Hope it is helpful,
/Javier

Well, based on sipit observations it appears much easier to compile a short
list of those that do TCP in large scale. Solely based on what I'm aware
of sole presence of TCP is okay, 50k TCP connections is very good, 200k
is fantastic (and to some extent uncertain) and more than that is sci-fi.

Hi Christer,
=20
Noting happened after that dicussion.
=20
As I said some time back I prefer it to be Drafted.
I agree adding time zone may increase the complexity , but also gives a
lot of  other uses which can be used in applications.

The remote UDP IP address and port are used to open the TCP connection.
 This works because "[f]or any port and interface that a server listens
on for UDP, it MUST listen on that same port and interface for TCP."
(RFC 3261 Section 18.2.1).

I will add this to the draft.

This is a nice improvement on my proposal, and I would suggest an
additional improvement by using Indications for ForceTCP and GiveToken.
The proxy can retransmit the ForceTCP Indication until the GiveToken is
received, and so reduce the number of STUN messages exchanged to two.

The only problem I see with this pattern is that it is not scalable.
The reason I proposed to store the association in the UA is that there
is no need for data locking in the proxy.  With your pattern, the
structure that contains the mapping between UDP and TCP flows needs to
be locked during the access, and as this is a global structure that will
be under heavy use, this will reduce the scalability.

Yes, I knew about this problem.  I thought about using a STUN 100 Error
response to stop the retransmission, but I discovered that it does not
work.  I sent an email to the BEHAVE list about this issue:

http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/behave/current/msg01859.html

I do not expect to have this draft published as an RFC.  I do not like
to complain about problems without proposing solutions, and an I-D is a
good way to present them.

UDP as it is in Outbound does not work and need to be fixed.  My
proposal (or another proposal) can be added to the existing Outbound
draft, but I do not think that this is a good idea to delay even more
Outbound.  Another solution would be to remove completely UDP from
Outbound and add a text saying that UDP is still mandatory, but Outbound
covers only TCP, and to start to work on a UDP-Outbound draft (based or
not on my draft).

you must be joking.  looks like ietf folks are living in an extremely

With all due respect to everyone, I would like to echo and amplify this.
The entire direction of the SIP spec lately, outbound, ice, etc. have really
become overly complex.  I think a concerted effort to take a step back and
simplify things would benefit the entire community.

Thanks,

"For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat,
and wrong." H.L. Mencken (1880-1956)

SIP didn't create the problem.  The ISPs who didn't deploy IPv6, the
vendors who sold NAT boxes and especially people who does not understand
the end to end argument created the problem.

Sudan has always rejected plans to replace the AU force with a larger, stro=

 been reached for a hybrid UN-AU force, to break the deadlock over the Darf=
ur mission. More than 200,000 people have died in three years of conflict i=
n the region. His Foreign Minister Lam Akol specified that "there should be=
 no talk about a mixed force". President Omar al-Bashir told state TV: "The=
 government of Sudan welcomes all financial, material, logistic or technica=

Oh yes! I fully agree on this analysis. For instance deploying IPv6 =
would have had much lower cost and complexity at the end than all these =
solutions we need to workaround and stuff would have worked nicely and =
smoothly probably faster......but creating problems often justify things =
that otherwise won't be necessary and so here we are :-)

Do you honestly think that there wouldn't be NAT if the world were
completely IPv6?  NAT may have originally been put in place to alleviate the
IPv4 address exhaustion problem but separation of address spaces is more
useful than that, no matter how big the address spaces are.  While I would
luv for the public Internet to be purely end-to-end wrt IP addresses, this
just is never going to happen again.  The early days of a few hundred VAXs
all happily talking to each other directly are long gone.  The days of trust
are gone forever and NAT is just one reflection of that.

SIP didn't create the problem.  The ISPs who didn't deploy IPv6, the
vendors who sold NAT boxes and especially people who does not understand
the end to end argument created the problem.

I agree, but it is not a reason to not try to improve things.  NAT,
firewalls, load balancers, B2BUA and SBC are the cancer of Internet.

So, how do you solve the problem of using a SIP endpoint behind a NAT? a
SIP endpoint been defined as running on UDP AND TCP.  Because this is
the problem here.

Yes, but for that (if needed) ISPs would use sort of topology hiding =
functions in the sip infrastructure not uncontrolled NAT boxes. Or, what =
about distributed FWs?

But anyway, this is an endless discussion as it was for the IPv6 and e2e =
argument. I think the situation is what it is, and we need solutions. =
However, if we could aim to a cleaner future that would help a lot.

Well, you asked...

There are two ways that I think are a lot simpler, one more radical than the
other.

First, the "less" radical approach.

For SIP, just spec TCP for transport and have the UAs punch holes through
the Firewall/NAT and keepalive them.  This I think is sort of what Dean was
eluding to in an earlier email.

For media, ICE is a solution.  But, it seems overly complex to me.  Consider
this article:

http://www.heise-security.co.uk/articles/82481

When you see the address of the incoming media in the SDP, just punch a hole
in the FW/NAT.

Second, the "more" radical approach.

If we really want to solve the NAT problem simply, we need to revisit the
basic assumption that signaling and media are on different transport ports.
We could use the basic idea in IAX2 of separate address space behind the
transport port number.  We've already breached the multiplexing of multiple
protocols onto a single transport address.  Why not do it right?  Allow
STUN, SIP, and RTP to all use the same transport address and use another
address behind the port number to de/mux them.

Here's the basic architecture of IAX2 for those that haven't seen it
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-guy-iax-02.txt):

       +-----------------+                     +------------------+

       |  +-+    /       |                     |       \    +-+   |
       |  | |---+        |                     |        +---| |   |
       |  +-+            |                     |            +-+   |
       +-----------------+                     +------------------+
             Host 1                                   Host 2


Something completely different.  Like I said before, I would prefer the
separation of signaling and media on separate ports but the NAT problem in
my opinion, along with the close relationship between signaling and media
streams, makes it untenable.

it has already been solved in practise.  see see/openser documentation
for proxy operation and, for example, nokia SIP UA for TCP UA operation.
there is no need to standardize anything for nat traversal.  

there would have been need to standardize UA behavior for load balanced
resilient operation, but that was excluded from outbound.  now there is
nothing left worth writing an outbound rfc.

This was why I wanted to concentrate on the high level goals. It  
seems that most people agree with 1 and 2 and I  may have stated 3  
poorly but I get the idea that if 3 is something large and complex  
with long delay people don't want to wait for it and if 3 simply  
means that you can multiregister with two protocols people have no  
objections to it and see benefits for some cases.

Cisco has many UAs that support TCP though you are right that not  
100% of them do.  Trust, me there are lots of things I wish Cisco SIP  
stuff did that it does not yet do but that is partially the time lag  
between standards and implementations and a little bit the nature of  
some of the specifications IETF writes do not seem to be particularly  
wanted by customers. (Insert S/MIME joke here :-)

I has asked many times for a commercially available proxy that did  
over 100k TCP connections and high reliability (I include open source  
stuff as commercially available since a customer can use it). I have  
yet to receive a reply to that request. People have said it is  
possible to build them, and I believe those people, I'm just pointing  
out that if someone doing a vonage like service today does not seem  
to have many choices about if they are going to use UDP or not. Over  
time, I'm suspect that will change and I think it is critical that  
outbound does provide a TCP solution but I think it is also important  
that it provide a UDP solution for the people that want to use that  
today.

When you connect a counterpath or snom softphone behind a NAT to SER  
over TCP and incoming calls work, that is because they doing some of  
what outbound specifies. Something that strictly followed the  
existing RFC would try and form a new TCP connection and fail. I  
think it is important to get this finished and out there so more  
things can follow it and work too. I don't think there are long  
existing mechanisms that work and are optimal. Several proprietary  
solutions have been done and non optimal things like registering  
every 15 seconds have been done but clearly a standards based  
approach with a more optimal solution seems like a good idea.

Ah, but you do not answer the question:
"[H]ow do you solve the problem of using a SIP endpoint behind a NAT? a
SIP endpoint been defined as running on UDP AND TCP."

Basically what you are saying (with the other UDP-haters in this list)
is that the UDP problem is too complex, so let's just remove UDP from
the list of transports supported by SIP.

As this is the I *E* T F, I was hoping for more enthusiasm to solve
problems, instead of sweeping them under the rug.

ICE is a brilliant and complex solution to complex problems.  But the
problems solved by ICE goes beyond just NAT traversal.  It also offers a
strategy for IPv4 to IPv6 migration, a way to create direct connection
for two UA behind the same NAT and a nice solution for multihomed UA.

Yes, it is extremely funny to see sysadmins discovering STUN more than
five years after the publication of the first draft.

BTW sysadmins also break the end to end argument.  Think about that.

you simply write a one paragraph best practise rfc that says that in
case of tcp, it is good idea to use between ua and proxy a persistent
tcp connection that is refreshed every X minutes using crnl or tcp
keepalive.

Not sure that an UA that cannot receive initial SIP requests would be
very useful.

Ah, but you do not answer the question:
"[H]ow do you solve the problem of using a SIP endpoint behind a NAT? a
SIP endpoint been defined as running on UDP AND TCP."

Basically what you are saying (with the other UDP-haters in this list)
is that the UDP problem is too complex, so let's just remove UDP from
the list of transports supported by SIP.

As this is the I *E* T F, I was hoping for more enthusiasm to solve
problems, instead of sweeping them under the rug.


FM: Hole punching will work for UDP and TCP both.

FM: I'm not a UDP hater but I do think that TCP is the proper transport
protocol that fits this application.  I also think that if you have TCP, UDP
is probably unnecessary.  I would advocate the dropping of UDP in a "version
3.0" of SIP but not for -outbound.  There is too much installed base that
uses UDP (including my stuff!).

> 
> For media, ICE is a solution.  But, it seems overly complex to me.  

ICE is a brilliant and complex solution to complex problems.  But the
problems solved by ICE goes beyond just NAT traversal.  It also offers a
strategy for IPv4 to IPv6 migration, a way to create direct connection
for two UA behind the same NAT and a nice solution for multihomed UA.

FM: What does ICE do for IPv6 transistion that hole punching does not?

FM: Two UAs behind the same NAT should not have to traverse the NAT.  They
should be smart enough to figure that out.  I don't think there's anything
wrt "IPv4 to IPv6 transition" (whatever that means) that would not be
possible with hole punching.

Yes, it is extremely funny to see sysadmins discovering STUN more than
five years after the publication of the first draft.

BTW sysadmins also break the end to end argument.  Think about that.


FM: The article talks about hole punching, which is more than STUN.  In SIP,
you would get your visible IP address, put that into the SDP and when the
other UA gets it, they punch a hole in their FW/NAT based on the address you
sent them to allow incoming media to flow.

FM: No comment on the more radical approach I guess...   ;)

FM

are you saying that UA implementors are so brain damaged that they
cannot figure out to initiate a tcp connection without being told so by
ietf?

A large percentage of the TCP implementations observed at SIPIT  
formed a new TCP connection for every transaction and take down the  
connection at the end of the transaction - some, I kid you not,  
closed the TCP connection after sending the request but before  
receiving the response.

Now in fairness, most of these were, ah, implementations that had  
lots of other parts that needed improvement and not implementations  
that had been to lots of sipits and seen lots of testing but it did  
open my eye. The people that have these implementations always point  
out that they seem to be following the spec.  I don't think the specs  
have to be an full implementers guide so I'm not sure that this  
little story has much bearing on what we should be doing in the specs  
other than realize that people do implement some things that seem a  
little wacky at times. No matter what we say in the RFCs, there will  
always be people who manage not to understand them but it would be  
nice if the bulk of the people understood what they needed to do.

i agree that many implementors don't care about rfcs.  just an example
from this very week:

we noticed that a popular sip phone vendor didn't implement g726 as
specified in rfc3551.  the vendor did two mistakes: payload type was 2
and media packing was wrong.  

when i complained about it, vendor replied that they don't care about
the rfc, but rather follow cisco, who also has wrong implementation of
g726.  comforting was they would consider fixing their implementation if
i would order 20,000 phones from them.

coming back to tcp, if implementors don't think before they start
coding, ietf can produce a best practise document saying that it is a
good idea to initiate tcp connections and keep them open.  it is a pure
implementation issue, not a protocol one.

I suppose this question would be more appropriate for the sip-implementors
list, but, as someone who's about to add TCP to their implementation...

I was going to keep the connection alive during the course of a dialog for
sessions and subscriptions and for transactions for other things.  Do any of
you have any comment on your practical experiences with how best to maintain
the life of TCP connections?

Thanks,
FM

sending crnl every ten minutes or so works fine.  if your tcp stack has
tcp keepalive support, you could try to use that although i don't have
practical experience about it.

Looking at most of exising web sites, I agree most of TCP connections
are temporary (ie: limited to the life of the HTTP transaction).
However for "dynamic" web sites like Gmail, there is a permanent TCP
connection reused for many HTTP transactions.

As SIP is definitely closer to "dynamic web sites", I would rather
limit TCP cases to the "permanent TCP" case only and remove the "UDP +
temporary TCP" case.

This is exactly where I do not follow.  You are proposing to remove UDP
from SIP (RFC 3261), where it works perfectly well, and to keep it in
Outbound, where it does not.

The ICE algorithm will prefer an IPv6 route for the media if it can find
one.

How?  Comparing IP addresses does not work.  AFAIK, ICE is the only
specification that permit this.

Well, the question started with "[h]ow do you solve the problem of using
a SIP endpoint behind a NAT?"

The protocol that you proposed is perhaps interesting, but does not
respond to this question.

Yes, an AJAX pattern tries to use a permanent connection to the server
and to use streaming to do not have to reload the data periodically.
This is explained here:

http://ajaxpatterns.org/HTTP_Streaming

This is the concerns in this document about the ability of a server to
manage a lot of permanent TCP connections that make me rethink the
assumption that permanent TCP connections for SIP was the definitive
solution.  After some prototyping and load testing, I concluded that it
was possible to use the hybrid TCP-UDP transport with an endpoint behind
a NAT, and that this solution was more scalable than the TCP-only solution.

Hi,

Since this issue is not outbound specific, I propose we start a separate
thread for it.

I believe I have also seen (and not only at SIPit) clients that
establish TCP connections per transaction.

But, even if you would establish the connection when the dialog is
established, and keep it open during the dialog, you still have the
question: are there cases/scenarios where the establishment of the TCP
connection takes too much time? Would the TCP connection have to be
established already prior to the establishment of the dialog?

If so, would it be useful to maintain the TCP connection during the
whole registration - also in non-outbound cases?

Regards,

Christer

Hi, Christer,

I had pinged Cullen for more details about the SIPit "TCP connections per 
transaction" experience, but since you followed up onlist, I will, too...

(1) Re: "the establishment of the TCP connection takes too much time" - the 
TCP handshake is three-way, so you're adding one RTT to the establishment of 
a dialog. How many RTTs are already required for DNS, etc. for a typical 
INVITE in your environment?

(2) More generally - the alternatives would be opening a new TCP connection 
per (a) message, (b) transaction, (c) dialog, or (d) registration, right?

I had observed to Cullen that SIP is normatively dependent on HTTP/1.1, and 
HTTP spent a LONG time coming up with a coherent transport story, even for 
the restricted case where NAT and FW traversal tended to be initiated 
unidirectionally (that story turned out to be, roughly, the clients leave 
connections open, up to some limited number of connections, and servers 
leave the connections open as long as it seems reasonable to do so - and a 
server might choose to close connections immediately). It's not surprising 
that we are seeing some server implementations use the same strategy for 
SIP. Apps programmers tend to ignore transport considerations until they 
recognize a problem.

Whatever the final guidance on connection lifetime turns out to be, SIP over 
TCP is likely to work better if we write it down fairly soon ... and I don't 
think more than an Informational document is needed.

Hi,

Since this issue is not outbound specific, I propose we start a separate
thread for it.

I believe I have also seen (and not only at SIPit) clients that
establish TCP connections per transaction.

But, even if you would establish the connection when the dialog is
established, and keep it open during the dialog, you still have the
question: are there cases/scenarios where the establishment of the TCP
connection takes too much time? Would the TCP connection have to be
established already prior to the establishment of the dialog?

If so, would it be useful to maintain the TCP connection during the
whole registration - also in non-outbound cases?

Regards,

Christer

The difference is that SIP is often used for real-time type of
applications (a good old "phone call" is probably the best example :).
You don't mind if you have to wait a few seconds for your webpage to
open, but you do mind if it takes a long time to reach the remote party
when making a phone call (maybe there could even be regulatory
issues...).

Hi, Christer,

Sorry I wasn't clearer (beyond jet-lag, to a place I call "jet-stupid"). I 
wasn't thinking about the number of RTTs just from the UA's perspective, I 
was thinking about the total amount of stop-and-wait delays that happen 
while the INVITE is being processed.

There is an optimization path that says "this action takes so long that I 
want to shave every millisecond, no matter what problems that causes", but 
if we're talking about a rather slow action anyway, will anyone actually 
notice the milliseconds we save? Maybe yes, maybe not, but since 
optimizations have a cost, we need to understand the benefit associated with 
that cost.

And looking further down in your response, I wasn't clearer on another 
topic - I agree that the strategy you've seen at SIPits is questionable, I'm 
just saying that the people who used that strategy may be reusing it from 
another environment where it made more sense, without thinking about how SIP 
and HTTP/1.1 differ in their transport needs. I agree with your comment that 
this can be a problem because users think "real-time" means "real-soon".

Thanks,

Spencer

>(1) Re: "the establishment of the TCP connection takes too much time" - the TCP handshake is three-way, so you're adding one RTT to the establishment of a dialog. How many RTTs are already required for DNS, etc. for a typical INVITE in your environment?

I dont think it really matters so much, because what I would call a reasonable
vanilla SIP implementation establishes TCP connection during registration. 
Sending/receiving an INVITE doesn't add up.

>(2) More generally - the alternatives would be opening a new TCP connection per (a) message, (b) transaction, (c) dialog, or (d) registration, right?

Yes, that's possible implementors' choices.
I think that if there is no bulk traffic then keeping number of connections equal to one
for as long as possible eliminates extra TCP setup times and confusion with multiple
connections (which one is associated with which contact...).

Possibly those who use SIP for bulk transport such as SIMPLE may be keen to have
parallel TCP connections to minimize blocking.


>I had observed to Cullen that SIP is normatively dependent on HTTP/1.1, and HTTP spent a LONG time coming up with a coherent transport story, even for the restricted case where NAT and FW traversal tended to be initiated unidirectionally (that story turned out to be, roughly, the clients leave connections open, up to some limited number of connections, and servers leave the connections open as long as it seems reasonable to do so - and a server might choose to close connections immediately). It's not surprising that we are seeing some server implementations use the same strategy for SIP. 

I'm not sure how good the HTTP parralle works sind we need inbound traffic too and connections
closed at proxy's discretion prohibit that. We do it too in SER when we run out of TCP connections.
Which leads to reasonable clients reregistering themselves to stay reachable and the problem shifts
to other clients. I think having reasonable client recommendations (behave?) which would
keep number of connections low (to avoid ambiguities and overloaded servers) is a safe thing
to do.

Keep it as long as you can until you don't shut the client down
(i.e., unregister).

which appears to me to be a behave application guidance bcp candidate.

give the client the responsibility for establishing transport connection,
keeping it alive (and reestablish session state if connection is gone), 
be symmetric.

 From my perspective, any place you have a discussion about 
transport/TCP/UDP,
you should actually have a discussion about (D)TLS as if were always 
enabled.
That is the medium to even short term goal, IMO, so framing the overheads as
"just" the 3-way TCP handshake really misses the boat on how you strategize
for exchanges that are actually 10x more expensive (or more, fsvo 
"expensive").

Agree, and thanks for the followup.

Spencer

p.s. Just for general background, I got sucked into the void of TCP vs UDP 
for wireless devices in the late 1990s, when the Wireless Application 
Protocol (WAP) people were totally freaked out about the way TCP seemed to 
work on GPRS links, etc. This was one of the hottest topics when the PILC 
TSV working group started up. They did a lot of work on WAP-specific 
alternatives to TCP, but when they did WAP 2.0, they ended up with a 
recommendation for "wireless profiled TCP" anyway - and the "wireless 
profile" from several years ago is now pretty much mainstream TCP. They were 
solving a different problem, so I'm not saying this will happen for SIP, I'm 
just saying that trying to shave milliseconds without looking at the entire 
picture - as Michael pointed out - "misses the boat".

Hi,

So, then we need to identify the cost of having a "permanent" (alive
during the whole registration) TCP connection. We DO use it for
outbound, so...

Nothing to do with outbound but my 2 cents on this is a UA should try  
to keep the TCP connection open as long as the registration (that  
means forever in most cases or until the UA reboots or shutdown).  
Proxies should try and keep TCP connections open until they run out  
of resources then have some algorithm to determine which connections  
to kill to clear up resources.

I suspect most people will give you about the same answer.

There is already a document that discusses TCP connection
maintenance (i.e., reuse) orthogonal to the outbound case.
The document is connect-reuse-07,
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-07.txt,
although lately, it always seems to be hanging under the sword
of Damoclese.

The document itself is ready, has been implemented, and does
talk about the distilled wisdom in client and server TCP socket
management (see S8).  It is an aggregation from the original
work some of us did as a loose design team in TCP connection
guidelines([1], which has since expired and portions subsumed in
connect-reuse), and Rohan's connection alias draft, before outbound
came into the picture.

Please read it, and if this does not satisfy your requirements,
I would be more than glad to start a dialog to accommodate
them to an agreed consensus.  Given the regularity with which TCP
connection reuse gets asked on the list, it would be a shame
to jettison the current work on it.

Irrelevant side comment but ... oddly, I am perfectly willing to wait  
2 seconds for a phone post dial delay but waiting even one second for  
my web page drives me insane.

I just put out an updated version of outbound. Now before you even  
look at it, I did not touch the TCP keep alive. I realize the  
questions of if the TCP keep alive are STUN or Double CRLF is still a  
hot topic. I don't know if it is an open issue or not - I'm working  
with the chairs on trying to figure that out. However, this topic is  
totally orthogonal from all the other issues so I did my best to  
resolve the other issues.

Specifically:

The draft makes it clear that if you can do TCP Keep alive, you can  
use those instead of other Keep alive approaches for TCP.

The draft makes it clear that deployments that want to use only TCP  
can use only TCP and do not not have to do any UDP based outbound  
registrations.

The draft makes it clear that deployments that want to use only UDP  
can use only UDP but that large requests will not work and lots of  
the functional of SIP will not work  If there are drawbacks of using  
UDP that I missed, I am glad to add them.

The draft makes it clear that deployments that want to use both TCP  
and UDP or some combination of them can do that and can use the  
current RFC 3261 message switchover approaches if you have both. If  
future works such as draft-petithuguenin-sip-outbound-fragmentation  
defined some way to dynamical start TCP connections, it would work  
fine with outbound and outbound would not forbid something like that.

Pekka (and others) have been regularly pointing out that for  
standards track documents, the normative statements need to be  
testable for the document to be able to advance. Because of this,  
certain types of normative operational advice need to be done in  
BCPs. The draft has no normative language that would block it from  
moving forward in the standards track but it does have very clear  
operational advice on what the problems of using UDP are.

The draft does not change in 3261 the protocols a UA, Proxy, or  
Registrar need to implement. This would be a very difficult thing for  
us to get consensus on and I see no need to get consensus on a change  
here to move this document forward *soon* in a way that meets  
everyone needs.

Until it shows up in the directory, you can find it at:

http://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/fluffy/draft-ietf-sip- 
outbound-07.html
http://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/fluffy/draft-ietf-sip- 
outbound-07.txt

Now more on the big hot item:

Bit of history on this - we have had this as an open issues slide at  
countless IETF meetings. I thought we had closed it a few meetings  
ago but one of the authors reopened it. Then at a later meeting we  
took a big hum to close it once and for all and it was a the usual  
big room full of people and we had a pretty strong hum towards use  
the same thing for both UDP and TCP.  Then very recently on the list,  
the chairs took a poll on the subject. The poll had very few  
responses but were overwhelming in favor of using CRLF. I counted 12  
people in favor of CRLF. (Jeroen, Ekki, Elwell, Aki, Markus, ALfred,   
Miguel, Hisham, Francois,  Byron, Mac, Fredrik).  Unfortunately, none  
of the people that were proponents of STUN in the wg hum commented on  
the most recent poll.

So where does this leave us. Well luckily for me, it leaves the issue  
firmly in the lap of the chairs to determine consensus and I just  
have to edit the document. My personal view on the topic is that 12  
people is no where near enough to overturn the huge hum however given  
the strong direction of the recent poll, it may however be enough for  
the chairs to decide this is an "Open Issue". If it is an open issue,  
then I suspect the only place to get strong enough consensus to  
overturn the previous hum is in the next WG meeting.  I'll work with  
the chairs in trying to find out what they want to do here.

Hi,

Thanks for the draft!

A few comments/questions on chapter 8.

First, the text now says that the edge proxy can indicate support of
keepalive by inserting the parameter e.g. in the Path header. So, maybe
the following text futher down could also be modified:

"For example, automatic or manual configuration of an outbound-proxy-set
which contains the keepalive=3Dstun parameter is
considered sufficient explicit indication."

...would be:

"For example, automatic or manual configuration of an outbound-proxy-set
which contains the keepalive=3Dstun parameter, or the receival of the
parameter in the Path header of the edge proxy, is considered..."


Second, the text says that the explicit indication is needed before any
traffic is sent. I said earlier that one could send the REGISTER before
any STUN is sent. And, if the indication comes in the REGISTER response
the REGISTER has to be sent before. OPTIONS is another example there
"traffic" may be sent before the indication has be retrieved. So, maybe
some clarification text is needed, saying that "STUN traffic" (the way
the text is now written could be understood to also cover SIP traffic)
shall not be sent before the indication has been retrieved.

Regards,

Christer

Yes, people may say that it is how things SHOULD work. But, from what I
hear from peoples SIPit experience etc some people seem to do things in
a different way. And, at the end what is implemented and deployed is
what really matters :)

Hi Vijay,

It's a good document, and I don't think the main issue is that we would
have to design something new. I think it's more about how people have
understood the specs and implemented things.

However, the draft does not talk about re-using registration TCP
connections. No, it may not forbid it either, but maybe it would be good
to add some text and/or example flows about that case also into chapter
4, together with the INVITE ones? Maybe also some text in chapter 8,
talking about keeping the connection alive during the whole registration
(and not only say that the connection should not be disconnected
together with the dialog) would be useful.

Regards,

Christer

the mailing list needs to be the authority that determines consensus,
not the meeting that is attended only by those who can afford it.

Well, then we don't need any hums in the future, do we? :)

Seriously, I do agree, but I (and I am sure others too) have received
comments saying that "there was a concensus in this-or-that IETF
meeting", without the issue really even being discussed on the mailing
list. In some cases things have been discussed on the list, and have
even got some support, but then being turned down at the meeting.

So, does that mean that all decissions made at meetings should be agreed
also on the list after that?

Regards,

Christer

It hasn't always been clear in this thread what kinds of usage 
connection reuse that is assumed. I get the impression that some of the 
people talking in this thread think that sip-outbound is needless 
complexity and that connection reuse is enough, even in the presence of 
NATs.

The doc referenced above is quite clear that TCP connections can only be 
reused for *requests* by the end that established the connection - if 
requests are to flow in both directions then there must be a separate 
connection established in each direction. This is needed to prevent 
hijacking by bad guys. When a NAT is involved it won't be possible to 
establish a connection in the reverse direction.

For typical deployments it seems unlikely that connection-reuse will be 
sufficient.

Are you suggesting that a *registration connection* can be used 
bidirectionally?

One of Rohan's versions of connection reuse attempted to piggyback on 
registration to authenticate the connection for use in the opposite 
direction. IIRC that what found to have a number of security holes and 
so was given up, in favor of using outbound for that.

That is one of the options presented earlier in the thread, yes.

That is how outbound works, and my understanding of Vijay's commant was
that connection-reuse can be used for that non-outbound cases.

If not, I missunderstood Vijay, or he missunderstood me :)

So, you are saying that connection-reuse can only be used to reuse
dialog initiated TCP connections, and that registration initiaded
connections are only used for registartion purpose?

Christer

Well, if you use connection-reuse with TCP keepalive you will solve the
NAT issue, won't you (assuming the connection is bidirectional)? But,
you will not have the multiflow feature that outbound provides.

I am not sure I understand. Isn't the re-use per direction
(unidirectional usage of a connection) already specified in RFC3261? The
connection-reuse drafts, as far as I understand (I'm sure Vijay can give
more details :) defines the bidirectional usage of a connection.

"So, does that mean that all decissions made at meetings should be agreed 
also on the list after that?"

Yes, precisely. This is required in our WG BCP, RFC 2418. Scott Bradner 
graciously pointed me to

3.2. Session venue

   Each working group will determine the balance of email and face-to-
   face sessions that is appropriate for achieving its milestones.
   Electronic mail permits the widest participation; face-to-face
   meetings often permit better focus and therefore can be more
   efficient for reaching a consensus among a core of the working group
   participants.  In determining the balance, the WG must ensure that
   its process does not serve to exclude contribution by email-only
-> participants.  Decisions reached during a face-to-face meeting about
-> topics or issues which have not been discussed on the mailing list,
-> or are significantly different from previously arrived mailing list
-> consensus MUST be reviewed on the mailing list.

The last sentence is the relevant part.

Thanks, Scott, for helping me find this during jet lag!

Spencer

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: M. Garcia-Martin, G. Camarillo
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-01.txt
	Pages		: 18
	Date		: 2007-1-8
	
This document specifies a mechanism that allows a SIP User Agent
   Client (UAC) to request a SIP URI-list (Uniform Resource Identifier
   list) service to send a SIP MESSAGE request to a set of destinations.
   The client sends a SIP MESSAGE request that includes the payload
   along with the URI-list to the MESSAGE URI-list service, which sends
   a similar MESSAGE request to each of the URIs included in the list.

This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this
   method can be used to refer servers to multiple resources.  These
   extensions include the use of pointers to Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI)-lists in the Refer-To header field and the "multiple-refer" SIP
   option-tag.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: C. Jennings, R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-outbound-07.txt
	Pages		: 42
	Date		: 2007-1-8
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to
   initiate TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User
   Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, many practical
   considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network
   Address Translators (NATs), prevent servers from connecting to User
   Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User
   Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be
   delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It
   also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open
   and specifies the usage of multiple connections.

AFAIK the connection can be established any time and used for any 
requests send in the direction that the connection was established. It 
doesn't matter whether the first request is REGISTER, INVITE, or 
something else.

No, I'm not saying anything about dialogs. I am saying that once you 
have established the connection in one direction you believe you know 
who you have connected to, and so can continue to use that for other 
requests to the same direction. But a server that accepts an incoming 
TCP connection cannot ascertain the source of that connection and so 
can't use it to originate requests in the opposite direction.

The situation is different for TLS. That is why the connection reuse 
draft specifies how/when a TLS connection can be used in the reverse 
direction.

No you don't because the connection can't be used for requests in the

I'm sure Vijay will chime in here, but it seems clear to me that it does 
not.

Hi Paul,

You are right. The connection-reuse bidirectionaltity is for TLS only.=20

Vijay did only talk about TCP in his mail, though. Was that a misstake,
or did I missunderstand?

So, that means that you can re-use the registration connection
unidirectionally (and, in the end the INVITE sent from the client is the
critical one, as far a post dial delay is concerned) already using
RFC3261. So, again, it's not about defining/using new extensions - it's
about how to implement core SIP in a most effective way.

But, I still think the registraion clarifications I mentioned earlier
would be good for the connect-reuse draft.

Regards,

Christer=20

Sorry for the delayed response; yes, let me chime in here.

Connection-reuse defines the bidirectional usage of a connection
for the TLS transport only, not the TCP transport.  For TCP, it
is a connection-in-each direction because of the security
properties associated with the TCP transport when used in SIP
(so, you should not open up a TCP connection for REGISTER and
expect to receive requests in the backwards direction over it.)

Connect-reuse is NOT a replacement for outbound.  Outbound
addresses non-transitive trust in the form of NATs that
connect-reuse does not.  Outbound also addresses keeping
multiple flows open, which connect-reuse does not.

Basically, connect-reuse provides guidance to implementors
that fills in the blanks of what is left unsaid in rfc3261 --
whether a connection is open per transaction, per dialog,
or per whatever; connection lifetimes; mutual authentication
when using X.509 certificates; connection reuse across
virtual SIP servers; etc.  *That* is its value, IMHO.

Thanks,

Bingo!  That is what I said in my last email, namely

   Basically, connect-reuse provides guidance to implementors
   that fills in the blanks of what is left unsaid in rfc3261 --
   whether a connection is open per transaction, per dialog,

I'd be more than happy to work with you on clarifying any aspects
in the connect-reuse draft.  Your registrations clarifications from
a previous email were:

   However, the draft does not talk about re-using registration TCP
   connections. No, it may not forbid it either, but maybe it would be
   good to add some text and/or example flows about that case also
   into chapter 4, together with the INVITE ones? Maybe also some
   text in chapter 8, talking about keeping the connection alive
   during the whole registration (and not only say that the
   connection should not be disconnected together with the dialog)
   would be useful.

Based on this, it is clear that we cannot use the same TCP connection
which we used to register to receive incoming requests.  But,
the draft can and does provide guidance on when to reclaim the
connection (i.e., definitely not after the dialog is over.)

Is there anything else that I may have missed?

Thanks,

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-01.txt
	Pages		: 15
	Date		: 2007-1-8
	
This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this
   method can be used to refer servers to multiple resources.  These
   extensions include the use of pointers to Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI)-lists in the Refer-To header field and the "multiple-refer" SIP
   option-tag.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-01.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

In the text you copied from my previous mail, what if you replace TCP

I admit I haven't read version -07 of the draft in detail, but does it
talk about how to maintain the TCP connection, e.g. using TCP keepalive
or something similar? I can only find a statement saying that the
connection shall be open "for as long as the resources on the host
operating system allow it to".

I agree. And, and that is what my proposal to add text/examples about
the registration connection was mainly about. It doesn't matter that the
connection is unidirectional.

Question:
=======

As per the draft:
   If the URI-list of the REFER request contains a repeated URI, the
   REFER-Recipient MUST behave as if that URI appeared in the URI-list
   only once.  The REFER-Recipient uses the comparison rules specific to
   the URI scheme of each of the URIs in the URI-list to determine if
   there is any URI which appears more than once.



Now if URI is appearing twice with different copy control or other
attribute,
which URI should REFER-Recipients consider

Also this may cause the processing delay at REFER-Recipients side if
multiple-refer
contains many URIs and each one needs to be compared against

Jaimin

          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

WGLC was initiated in the SIPPING WG on
draft-ietf-sipping-multiple-refer-02=20
on 12th January 2005 with comments requested by 12th February 2005.

Review was made and comments were received from: Nils Ohlmeier. During
the=20
course of the work comments have also been made by: Cullen Jenning,
Sharon=20
Fridman, Dale Worley, Jeroen van Bemmel, Darshan Bildikar, Dean Willis.

draft-ietf-sipping-multiple-refer-06 was extended to refer to
draft-ietf-
sipping-capacity-attribute and also synchronized with RFC 4488
(suppression=20
of REFER implicit subscription).

The document was moved from the SIPPING WG to the SIP WG in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427 because it defines an option tag (this was added at a late
stage in=20
the review process). The document was regarded by the SIPPING WG chairs
as=20
being adequately reviewed and no further review took place in the SIP
WG.=20
The SIP mailing list was polled on this status and no complaint was
made.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session=20
Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no
external=20
review from an external specialist is necessary. While the document
makes=20
use of XML within a SIP message body, that XML is defined by other
documents=20
(RFC 4488, draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05), and used in this=20
specification by reference.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

There is a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution in this area.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, these have been
performed=20
as a SIP working group item, and therefore this draft is in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS the document has been checked against idnits 1.123 and no
issues=20
have been found.

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative references are now published RFCs except
as=20
follows:
*	reference [9] draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05 is in IESG
review=20
as proposed standard.
*	reference [10] draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services-06 has been
submitted=20
to the IESG by the SIPPING group as proposed standard.
*	reference [11] draft-ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute-03 is
currently=20
in WGLC in the SIPPING group.

Of the informative references, there is only one open reference [14]
draft-
ietf-sip-gruu-11 which is expected to be submitted by the SIP WG to IESG

shortly.=20

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
          consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggested a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See
          [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis].  If the document
          describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

Section 11 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new
option-tag is=20
defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent with
RFC=20
3968 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the current=20
format of the registry.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document contains no entries written in formal language. While the=20
document makes use of XML within a SIP message body, that XML is defined
by=20
other documents (RFC 4488, draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05), and
used=20
in this specification by reference. Figures 1 and 3 contain an example
of=20
this XML usage which is apparently well-formed.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

Technical Summary

Working Group Summary

The document was originally produced by the SIPPING working group, but

Then, that would be fine; i.e., the connection established
during registration could be reused for requests coming into the
UA.  I can add this specific behavior for TLS in a new revision.

In another email in the same thread you wrote:

Connect-reuse does not talk about the keepalive aspect at all.
Since it does not assume NAT presence, there is no reason that the
connection should be torn down, unless of course one of the hosts
crashes, or actively tears the connection down to reclaim resources.

OK; I will add the registration case for TLS transports.  That
should not be a problem.  Anything else?

these sound about right. But I'd say this is mostly due to lack=20
of demand, rather than fundamental technical limitations of scaling=20
TCP in SIP servers. Once we have more SIP clients with "persistent=20
TCP" (i.e. TCP connections are kept alive as long as registration is=20
active), or "full sip-outbound" support, there is some motivation to
improve
the TCP support in servers. And there are already quite a few of these
clients on the market. Of course, in today's access networks filled=20
with stateful-firewalls-and-nats, without either "persistant TCP" or=20
sip-outbound, TCP is only of limited use on the client-proxy hop (as=20
the proxy won't have much success in initiating TCP connections towards
the clients).

I was involved in writing a paper concerning TCP scalability
in SIP servers (about to be published at ICN'07 [1], titled
"Scalability of TCP servers, handling persistent connections"),
and the results we got were mostly positive. We were able to hit=20
100k simultanenous registrations with TCP with commodity PC hw=20
and sw combo. All in all, scalability of TCP, although with some=20
per-connection overhead, was nearly identical to UDP (both limited by
available CPU&memory, with linear growth of resource usage). And
further,=20
the keepalive traffic had very little performance impact in terms of CPU

and memory bandwidth&usage (even if the heaviest possible method, i.e.=20
full REGISTERs, was used for keepalives).

   As per the draft:
      If the URI-list of the REFER request contains a repeated URI, the
      REFER-Recipient MUST behave as if that URI appeared in the URI-list
      only once.  The REFER-Recipient uses the comparison rules specific to
      the URI scheme of each of the URIs in the URI-list to determine if
      there is any URI which appears more than once.

   Now if URI is appearing twice with different copy control or other
   attribute, which URI should [be used?]

The problem is worse than this.  Due to the strange rules for SIP URI
equivalence, these are equivalent:

	sip:foo@example.com
	sip:foo@example.com;parameter=value

and these are equivalent:

	sip:foo@example.com
	sip:foo@example.com;parameter=other-value

but these are *not* equivalent:

	sip:foo@example.com;parameter=value
	sip:foo@example.com;parameter=other-value

So if all three are present in a URI-list, it's not even clear how
many should be used.

I seem to remember having a similar problem in the GRUU discussion,
and the outcome was that the GRUU I-D needed to define a new
comparison between SIP URIs that was stricter than 3261's
"equivalence".

It appears that we need that same comparison here.

This leads me to ask if we should entirely replace the definition of
"equivalent URIs" in section 19.1.4 of RFC 3261.  I did a quick search
of the text of 3261, and it doesn't appear that the equivalence of
URIs is *used* anywhere.

Dale,

You make a good point in this case. But we need to step carefully before 
making sweeping changes.

You say you don't find any *use* of URI comparison in 3261. Actually 
there is at least one, in section 10.3, step 7. It is used to compare 
Contact URIs in the request to those already registered.

It seems to me that there is simply a need for multiple comparison rules 
for different circumstances.

I would say both. At least for us, drilling OS kernel and dealing
with memory consumption was a laborous exercises. Nevertheless,
the demand as driven by existing implementations which are mostly
UDP-based has been indeed rather sporadic as of now.

indeed.

Was that impact on the overall performance (including database access,
processing user profile, etc.) or just stack throughput?

I think that chairs need to combine the input they receive in a  
meeting hum with the input they get on the list. Chairs are given  
pretty broad discretion in how they determine consensus but they  
certainly needs to be taking into account any input from the list.

Yep - I think that everyone meant what you are saying and we just  
typed it up wrong.

I will change this to say "STUN traffic".

Good. And, again, maybe an example flow in chapter 4 would be good too.

Ok. I don't know TCP well enough. I was thinking about cases where the
connection is unused for long periods of time.

Also, IF the connection, for whatever reasons, goes down I think it
would be good to suggest that it shall be re-established. In the
registration connection case, would a re-REGISTER have to be sent also?

I will look at the whole document more in detail later. For now I was

I'm not sure if you are discussing the TCP case or the TLS case here.

For the TCP case, where separate connections are used for each 
direction, there is no reason to reestablish a connection when it goes 
down, until it is needed for the same direction.

For TLS, the reason to do so would be if the connection can't be 
established in the other direction. But that is the outbound case. Since 
we aren't talking about that case here, and instead assume that a 
connection *can* be established in either direction, again there is no 
real reason to reestablish a connection at the time one goes down.

Early reestablishment of connections is instead likely to prevent the 
servers from dropping connections when they get too many.

thats no problem, it can "sleep" as long as it stays alive.

I think this is more a behave agenda item than sip(ping). In any case,
an app which wishes to stay reachable should reconnect and re-REGISTER
too because the contacts valid for previous TCP connections have changed.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Elwell
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-03.txt
	Pages		: 24
	Date		: 2007-1-9
	
Because of retargeting of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) dialog-
   forming request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the User
   Agent Server (UAS) can have a different identity from that in the To
   header field.  This document provides a means for that User Agent
   (UA) to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in
   the reverse direction and for that identity to be signed by an

   Authentication Service.  The same mechanism can be used to indicate a
   change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some action in
   the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a gateway.  This
   document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-03.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message. 
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then 
"get draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

The idea behind reestablishing the connections is to avoid the post dial
delay of establishing the connection when an INVITE is to be sent.

This has been updated following the San Diego meeting and taking into
account post-WGLC comments from JDR. As far as I am concerned all open
issues are resolved and it is ready for forwarding (it has been through
WGLC). The main changes from 02 are as follows:

- Numerous nits and minor editorial improvements
- Addition of a few explanatory notes
- Reformulation of 1st para of Intro
- In section 4.4.1, revised text on populating From and To header field URIs
- In section 4.4.2, revised text on updating the remote URI
- In section 4.7, simplified proxy behaviour text
- In section 5.2, improved description of the example
- In section 4.6, verifier behaviour re-aligned with RFC 4474
- In section 4.4.1, recommendation to regard the dialog as terminated if
428, 436, 437 or 438 is received in response to mid-dialog request

These last two points constitute resolution of the open issue discussed in
San Diego.

The signatures in the Identity header fields in the examples will need to be
recalculated before publication.

Correct.

The reason I think it's a sip(ping) issue is, again, due to the post
dial delay. Ie it has nothing to do with whether there is a NAT or not
in the network.

Hi,

I have implemented SIP stack with SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY features. To test
these, I need a SIP/IMS server.
Can you please revert me with any freely available server?

Thanks in advance.

Thanks !
Rathod.

(As WG chair)

This document has been through WGLC and at IETF #67 people seemed to
think we were pretty much finished apart from the discussion point that
took place in IETF #67.

I therefore intend to give a few days for people to check their
understanding of resolution of the issues discussed in IETF#67 is
correctly documented, and then send this document to the IESG.

Please therefore comment by say end Tuesday 16th January if you have any
concerns. If you consider an extension is needed please request. No
comments and no request for extension means this version (or an update
to recalculate the examples) goes to IESG.

Regards

Keith

For a UAC, there is typically a lot of extra time between the initiation 
and the completion of dialing, which can mask a lot of network delay. It 
has been suggested that ICE begin during this time. Establishing a TCP 
connection could also happen during this time.

But in any case the issue is largely irrelevant I think, because the use 
of TCP in this way only works if there are no NATs or FWs between the 
UAC and the proxy, which is likely not to be the case, or at least not 
known to be the case. Connection reuse is more relevant to connections 
between servers, with outbound being used for phones.

This I do not understand -- maybe I am missing something.  It
is true that in many deployments, especially inter-domain
deployments, NATs and FWs will dominate, and thus outbound is the
only solution here.

However, it is also true that a lot of communication traffic
between a UAC and proxy will be intra-domain.  In such cases,
connect-reuse can help because all the communicating endpoints
are behind the same enterprise NAT.  Hence the assumption in
connect-reuse of transitive connectivity.

Outbound is the most general and the most expansive solution
since it includes multiple flows and keepalives, and Other
Nice Things (TM).

Connect-reuse simply attempts to fill in some of the blanks
of rfc3261.

Certain shells (tcsh) and some versions of telnet may have an
inactivity timer that causes the session to be closed on the
absence of I/O for a certain time period.  However, this method of
timing out TCP connections is application specific and
presumably will not be used for SIP.

Assuming the application itself does not close the TCP session,
the session should stay up.  Look at ssh, for instance.
On Linux FC5, the ssh server sends out a keepalive probe
every 2 hours by default.  Assuming that the endpoints do not loose
TCP state through a crash or a connection termination, or that
your shell does not close the connection, the TCP session is kept
alive even if a router reboots in between that 2 hour window.

Certain shells (tcsh) and some versions of telnet may have an
inactivity timer that causes the session to be closed on the
absence of I/O for a certain time period.  However, this method of
timing out TCP connections is application specific and
presumably will not be used for SIP.

Assuming the application itself does not close the TCP session,
the session should stay up.  Look at ssh, for instance.
On Linux FC5, the ssh server sends out a keepalive probe
every 2 hours by default.  Assuming that the endpoints do not loose
TCP state through a crash or a connection termination, or that
your shell does not close the connection, the TCP session is kept
alive even if a router reboots in between that 2 hour window.

This thread is a month old, but I want to revise GRUU and get this done. 
This is really the only issue that is outstanding, I think.

To refresh everyones memory, the issue being dsicussed is this. 
Temp-GRUU expire when the last contact with the instance ID expires. In 
normal cases, the expiration is known to the UA. However, there are 
cases where there is a forceful de-registration, for example. In these 
cases, the UA will not know about it, and it won't know whether its 
temp-gruu remain valid.

We've seen three proposals for how to deal with this:

1. include a parameter in the Contact header field of the REGISTER 
response, indicating the time at which the first contact with that 
instance ID was registered. When this changes in a REGSITER response, 
the UA knows its older temp-gruu are invalid.

2. the UA uses a reg-event subscription, and it gets a NOTIFY when the 
contacts are de-registered. As long as the UA gets the notification 
indicating that the de-registration has happened, this works reasonably 
well.

3. the UA can use an OPTIONS sent to a temp-gruu to verify that it still 
works

(2) and (3) require no new mechanism, just explanation. (1) would 
require new mechanism.

Now, I was in the process of working through some details on this, and 
ran into problems. In particular, we ultimately need to be able to 
specify an algorithm that clearly tells a UA which of its temp GRUU are 
valid, and which are expired. If we are using the reg-event subscription 
to figure this out, the obvious algorithm would be to expire all 
temp-gruu learned in REGISTER responses prior to this notification. 
However, that is imprecise. What about a REGISTER that happens very 
close in time to the NOTIFY? Indeed, this is very likely to be the case 
when the reg-event is shortening the expiration in order to ask the user 
to explicitly re-REGISTER, but the time was a bit too short and the 
re-REGISTER is close to the boundary. If a NOTIFY comes indicating that 
the contact did expire, how do you *know* if that REGISTER came in 
before or after? You could wait for the next NOTIFY, and try and 
correlate it with the REGISTER you just completed.

One way to do that is with CSeq. The reg-event package includes the 
option of having CSeq numbers. If we assume these are always used (they 
are optional), the algorithm is a bit easier. Each temp-gruu is 
associated with the CSeq of the REGISTER in which it was learned. When a 
NOTIFY comes indicating that the registration has expired, you look to 
see if its a partial or full state NOTIFY. In the case of partial, if 
the NOTIFY explicitly removes a contact, you invalidate all temp-gruu 
learned in register responses prior to or equal to the CSeq in the 
contact. If the case of a full state NOTIFY, if the contact is absent, 
the UA marks all temp-gruu as suspect. On the first NOTIFY that 
indicates the Contact is re-registered (I assume the UA is 
re-registering), the UA invalidates all temp-gruu learned by REGISTER 
responses whose CSeq is less than the one in the NOTIFY. All others are 
considered valid.

This algorithm is assuming some very specific behavior from registrars 
that are doing reg-event with GRUU. Namely, they always send CSeq, even 
when indicating expiration of a contact. We'd need to specify this, 
probably as a note in gruu-reg-event.

Comments on this algorithm? If this is OK I will update GRUU based on 
this and we can ship it. Finally. Really this time.

You could have some speed-dial button which basically sends the INVITE
as soon as you press that button.

For TCP that is true, yes.=20

But, for TLS, where you have a bidirectional connection, connection
reuse should work fine also with NATs or FWs. This of course assumes
that the UA keep the connection open all the time (and re-establishes it
when it for whatever reason fails), in order to allow inbound requests
to reach the UA.

So, in this case, if you can live without the multiflow feature outbound
provides I think connection reuse would work perfectly.

Christer

yes, it's definitely not a trivial task either. On the bright side, SIP
server implementors are not alone with this -- more and more
applications
have similar requirements - AJAX-style web services, email (especially=20
the push variants), TLS-VPNs, etc, etc... all require more or less
persistent
TCP connections, and lots and lots of them. To implement the server end
for these services on a massive scale, one will face similar problems
than in scaling SIP servers which solely use TCP as the client-oproxy
transport.

And hey, having hundreds of thousands of clients sending keepalives
and some real traffic to a small set of UDP ports is not exactly=20
a trivial problem either... solvable, but not trivial.

The tests were done with a dummy registrar database (the REGISTERs
were processed normally, updating the in-memory db, but not stored=20
to a persistent database). This made sense, as we wanted to benchmark=20
TCP-vs-UDP specifically, and the cost of database access is same=20
for both.

I think this is less and less the case. I expect most calls to be
initiated via a buddylist or phonebook type application, or even via
linked phone numbers in an email message. In those cases, there is no
delay between initiation and completion of the "dialing" since it's a
single action.

Personally, I can't remember the last time I actually dialed to make a
phone call -- even a CS one.

Cheers,
Aki

That's because finns never make any phone calls - we only send SMS :)

I thought this particular thread was about TCP, not TLS. The issues are 
quite different for the two. I think I agree that simply maintaining a 
TLS connection might be an alternative to outbound in some cases.

Yes, that is possible. This starts to get into the detailed design of 
the user interface of the device. In many, but not all, cases there is 
some UI clue that you are about to do something, which could be used by 
the device as a hint to start some of the housekeeping operations. For 
instance opening the phone.

Whether that will get better or worse as devices and UIs evolve is TBD.

As long as there is some work that needs to be hidden there will be an 
incentive to construct the UI so as to hide it. Keeping a connection all 
the time is an alternative if the costs of doing so are acceptable.

Hi,

I agree with Aki. We are fooling ourselves if we think that the
potential delay problems with ICE or TCP connection setups etc. can be
cured with this kind of tricks. In general delays may not be an issue,
but in wireless access they can be.=20

I'm not objecting to establishing connections early, especially if doing 
so is needed to establish connectivity in the reverse direction. But 
when the connection is not required to establish connectivity in the 
reverse direction, and a connection has been dropped by the far end, 
then insisting on reestablishing it directly can be counterproductive to 
a server that has more connections than it can handle. So, if you have 
had your connection dropped, and you don't need it right now, I still 
think it would be best to wait until you do need it before attempting to 
reestablish it.

That's true but is that the mainstream case? I'm under impression that mostly
clients register to be able to get SIP traffic back. Server overload has to
be then handled on server side. Clients unreachable because overloaded
server are same unpleasent as clients unreachable because of disconnected TCP
connections.

If the server cannot establish a connection to the client, but the 
client can establish a TLS connection with mutual authentication, then 
that could qualify the client as *needing* a connection. I'm talking 
about other cases. In particular, if we are talking about TCP rather 
than TLS, then the client establishing a TCP connection doesn't 
establish a reverse path, unless outbound is used.

You can register with a server in order to receive outbound calls 
without maintaining a connection, as long as the server can establish a 
connection when it is needed.

Interesting..... There are in my source file, so some how they got lost

Jaimin, Dael:

The draft speaks about repeated URIs, meaning equivalent URIs.

I see the point that Dale wrote on equivalent URIs, which has been 
already discovered by GRUU. I also agree that we should have similar 
considerations here.

If we need such text, it should be written in the framework for URI-list 
services, since it applies to any draft, not only the REFER draft.

We don't need to mandate the connection to be re-established. But, I
think it would be good to document it as an option, and say what the
advantages of doing so would be.

Christer

Hi,all.
	I am a newbie here.. :-) So ask a stupid question first:
Can we defined our own Content-Type if we need a new Message Body type,
for example, can I define an "application/example" in my SIP program?

Thanks...

You can, but you will need to write an RFC to get it approved for IANA
registration.

   I am a newbie here.. :-) So ask a stupid question first:  Can we
   defined our own Content-Type if we need a new Message Body type,
   for example, can I define an "application/example" in my SIP
   program?

If you want to define an "official" Content-Type, you have to go
through the appropriate process.  (The process varies for different
protocol identifiers.  See http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.)

If you want a private, experimental Content-Type, use a second part
that starts with "x-".  "x-" is a blanket convention for private token
values.  So you can use "application/x-example" and know that that
name will never be standardized for another purpose.

If you want an unofficial Content-Type but think its use might become
widespread, put some sort of name after the "x-", like
"application/x-aquarius-example" to reduce the risk of collision with
other uses.

What should a server do that has more connections than it can manage? 
Presumably it must disconnect some of them, or refuse new ones. The 
advantage of disconnecting old ones is that it can choose those that 
have not been used for a long time. When rejecting new ones, there is no 
good way to distinguish those that are being established because they 
are needed right now for a call, and those that are being established 
"just in case". Things will be worse for those that really need a 
connection if those that don't attempt to make a connection anyway after 
having been rejected.

So, I think it would in fact be better to mandate that an attempt to 
reestablish a connection *not* be attempted immediately after a 
disconnect if it is not needed at that time.

That is one strategy that can be used, yes.

And here is where judicial use of policies comes into the picture.
Presumably, an implementation can save a certain number of sockets
for calls that are identified as emergency in nature -- those
having the SOS URI, for instance.  These calls will always get
through, no matter what.

An implementation can have a high watermark for simultaneous
TCP connections.  This high watermark will exclude the reserved
set, which allows SOS type of calls to come in.  We have had some
success using this technique.

We could always normatively specify it with a SHOULD
strength (and explain why).  Then your concern would be allayed,
and if an implementation still wanted to do pre-emptively open
a connection, it would have presumably weighed in the pros and
cons and decided accordingly.

Thanks.

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Vijay,

I'm not trying to distinguish between those making emergency calls, and 
those making regular calls. I'm trying to distinguish between those 
establishing a connection because they want to make a call *now* from 
those that are establishing a connection in order to minimize the call 
setup delay *later* if/when a call attempt is made.

Suppose a server can support 1000 connections, and devices connect as 
soon as turned on, and attempt to reconnect whenever their connection is 
dropped. Then when the device 1001 attempts to connect, the server will 
have to drop somebody - perhaps the one whose connection as been idle 
for the longest. But that device will immediately try to reconnect, 
forcing another device to be disconnected. This will continue 
indefinitely. Doesn't seem like a very good strategy.

Now, take a different approach: devices only connect when they *need* 
the connection (e.g. to make a call). Once connected, they stay 
connected until shut down or until the server disconnects them. There 
will be no problem at all until there are 1000 devices that have made a 
call. When another device needs to make a call it will attempt to 
connect, forcing one of the others - that hasn't used the connection 
recently - to be disconnected. That will cause no other actions until 
that device needs to send another message. There won't be a significant 
problem until there are 1000 devices with active calls. Even then, given 
that signaling usually happens at the beginning and end of calls, with a 
long period in between with no signaling, a lot more than 1000 devices 
can probably be supported with little difficulty.

Of course outbound does breakdown as soon as the number of devices 
exceeds the number of supported simultaneous connections. That might be 
a significant discriminator for deployment choices.

Subject: Re: [Sip] Issue: Expiration of temp-gruu

This thread is a month old, but I want to revise GRUU and get this done.

This is really the only issue that is outstanding, I think.

To refresh everyones memory, the issue being dsicussed is this.=20
Temp-GRUU expire when the last contact with the instance ID expires. In=20
normal cases, the expiration is known to the UA. However, there are=20
cases where there is a forceful de-registration, for example. In these=20
cases, the UA will not know about it, and it won't know whether its=20
temp-gruu remain valid.

We've seen three proposals for how to deal with this:

1. include a parameter in the Contact header field of the REGISTER=20
response, indicating the time at which the first contact with that=20
instance ID was registered. When this changes in a REGSITER response,=20
the UA knows its older temp-gruu are invalid.

2. the UA uses a reg-event subscription, and it gets a NOTIFY when the=20
contacts are de-registered. As long as the UA gets the notification=20
indicating that the de-registration has happened, this works reasonably=20
well.

3. the UA can use an OPTIONS sent to a temp-gruu to verify that it still

works

(2) and (3) require no new mechanism, just explanation. (1) would=20
require new mechanism.

Now, I was in the process of working through some details on this, and=20
ran into problems. In particular, we ultimately need to be able to=20
specify an algorithm that clearly tells a UA which of its temp GRUU are=20
valid, and which are expired. If we are using the reg-event subscription

to figure this out, the obvious algorithm would be to expire all=20
temp-gruu learned in REGISTER responses prior to this notification.=20
However, that is imprecise. What about a REGISTER that happens very=20
close in time to the NOTIFY? Indeed, this is very likely to be the case=20
when the reg-event is shortening the expiration in order to ask the user

to explicitly re-REGISTER, but the time was a bit too short and the=20
re-REGISTER is close to the boundary. If a NOTIFY comes indicating that=20
the contact did expire, how do you *know* if that REGISTER came in=20
before or after? You could wait for the next NOTIFY, and try and=20
correlate it with the REGISTER you just completed.

One way to do that is with CSeq. The reg-event package includes the=20
option of having CSeq numbers. If we assume these are always used (they=20
are optional), the algorithm is a bit easier. Each temp-gruu is=20
associated with the CSeq of the REGISTER in which it was learned. When a

NOTIFY comes indicating that the registration has expired, you look to=20
see if its a partial or full state NOTIFY. In the case of partial, if=20
the NOTIFY explicitly removes a contact, you invalidate all temp-gruu=20
learned in register responses prior to or equal to the CSeq in the=20
contact. If the case of a full state NOTIFY, if the contact is absent,=20
the UA marks all temp-gruu as suspect. On the first NOTIFY that=20
indicates the Contact is re-registered (I assume the UA is=20
re-registering), the UA invalidates all temp-gruu learned by REGISTER=20
responses whose CSeq is less than the one in the NOTIFY. All others are=20
considered valid.

This algorithm is assuming some very specific behavior from registrars=20
that are doing reg-event with GRUU. Namely, they always send CSeq, even=20
when indicating expiration of a contact. We'd need to specify this,=20
probably as a note in gruu-reg-event.

Comments on this algorithm? If this is OK I will update GRUU based on=20
this and we can ship it. Finally. Really this time.

Whatever it would do in the bi-directional connection case, when the
connection needs to be re-established in order for the client to receive
inbound requests...

I don't agree on that. We can describe the pros and cons of each option,
but we should allow both. An operator may have designed his network in a
way that each proxy can support enough number of connections, and in
that case terminals should not be forbidden to have re-estblish those
connections.

Christer

I'm running Safari to gmail and that does not seem to be true. It had  
a bunch of connections but they all seemed to close fairly quickly.  
Check it out and see if you get the same thing.

(I do agree with your meta point that AJAX is going to cause longer  
lived TCP connections).

One of the hilarious parts of this whole conversation is that one of  
the key reason UDP was done in the first place was that implementers  
felt it was much simpler and the "just keep SIP simple" argument was  
one of arguments for including UDP.

well, it's worth noting that in many real-life deployments the
TCP registration does establish a reverse path (even though
no IETF documents specify this yet -- waiting for sip-outbound).
Just look at iptel.org SER for example ("tcp_alias" settings, 
other implementations use "persistent TCP", etc, etc).

These ain't pretty, that's for sure, but allow to use TCP as the
transport with some of the already existing clients.

But how can a client possibly know which is the case? With
NATs on path, this is still doable, but with stateful firewalls, neither
the client nor the server can possibly know whether TCP 
connections can be established towards the client. Deciding-by-trial is way 
too slow as the FWs can drop packets silently, and the default 
timeouts are long. So except in cases where the access network 
characteristics are known, client will have to assume that _it_, the client,

is the party responsible for initiating connections.

Absolutely. In addition to the client-server-oriented NAT/firewall friendliness,
one can argue even more generally using e2e principiles or Murphy laws:
network can always fail somehow and the more robust approach for the client is
just to rely on itself.

PROTO writeup for

list-message-01.txt: "Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests in the Session

Initiation Protocol (SIP)"

   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
          document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

Keith Drage

The document has been reviewed and is ready for forwarding to IESG for=20
publication.

   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

WGLC was initiated in the SIPPING WG on
draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-message-
02 on 12th January 2005 with comments requested by 12th February 2005.

Review was made and no comments were received. During the course of the
work=20
comments have also been made by: Paul Kyzivat, Dean Willis, Jari
Urpalainen.

draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-message-07 was extended to refer to
draft-ietf-
sipping-capacity-attribute.

The document was moved from the SIPPING WG to the SIP WG in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427 because it defines an option tag (this was added at a late
stage in=20
the review process). The document was regarded by the SIPPING WG chairs
as=20
being adequately reviewed and no further review took place in the SIP
WG.=20
The SIP mailing list was polled on this status and no complaint was
made.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session=20
Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no
external=20
review from an external specialist is necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

There is a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution in this area.
The=20
document also forms part of 3GPP Release 6 content.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, these have been
performed=20
as a SIP working group item, and therefore this draft is in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS the document has been checked against idnits 1.123 and no
issues=20
have been found.

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative references are now published RFCs except
as=20
follows:
*	reference [10] draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05 is in IESG
review=20
as proposed standard.
*	reference [11] draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services-06 has been
submitted=20
to the IESG by the SIPPING group as proposed standard.
*	reference [12] draft-ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute-03 is
currently=20
in WGLC in the SIPPING group.

It should be noted that reference [7] is a normative reference despite
being=20
an informational RFC. It is believed that this meets the criteria of RFC

3967.

The document needs no informative references.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
          consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggested a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See
          [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis].  If the document
          describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

Section 11 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new
option-tag is=20
defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent with
RFC=20
3968 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the current=20
format of the registry.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document contains no entries written in formal language. While the=20
document makes use of XML within a SIP message body, that XML is defined
by=20
other documents (RFC 4488, draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05), and
used=20
in this specification by reference. Figure 2, and figure 3 contain an=20
example of this XML usage which is apparently well-formed.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

Technical Summary

This document specifies a mechanism that allows a SIP User Agent Client
(UAC)=20
to request a SIP URI-list (Uniform Resource Identifier list) service to
send=20
a SIP MESSAGE request to a set of destinations. The client sends a SIP=20
MESSAGE request that includes the payload along with the URI-list to the

MESSAGE URI-list service, which sends a similar MESSAGE request to each
of=20
the URIs included in the list.

Working Group Summary

The document was originally produced by the SIPPING working group, but
was=20

This is an excellent reformulation of the e2e principle.=20

Besides failures, it applies even more to security.=20
We can't risk our life to depend on unknown intermediaries.
This is the motivation for ZRTP among other.

Absolutely. In addition to the client-server-oriented NAT/firewall
friendliness,
one can argue even more generally using e2e principiles or Murphy laws:
network can always fail somehow and the more robust approach for the
client is
just to rely on itself.

Sean - I'm not sure exactly which point you are trying to make.

Certainly one option is to attempt to over configure the system so that 
there is enough capacity to accept every connection attempt. In certain 
closed environments that may be workable. But it is certainly not a 
solution for all environments.

Presumably every deployment will have *some* limit. This limit could be 
reached in normal operation if the operators don't have control over the 
number of clients attempting to connect. That limit can support more 
devices if they don't attempt to keep the connection up all the time 
than it can if they do.

The limit can also be reached as a result of devices that malfunction, 
or because of a DOS attack. The impact of that may also be worth some 
consideration.

What point are you making? Vijay responded as I would have - the single 
TCP connection has major security concerns if used bidirectionally. You 
should only use TCP if you know you don't have NAT/FW issues, so that a 
separate TCP connection can be made in the other direction.

Otherwise, if you have your own cert you can use TLS and avoid the need 
for connection establishment in the reverse direction, or else you can 
use outbound.

Practically speaking, a UA will typically not have a cert, and will need 
to use outbound. Connection reuse, via TCP or TLS, will typically only 
be useful between proxies.

Very few deployments have absolutely no idea what their expected use will be though. Proper provisioning based on intended usage and empirical evidence is a reasonable assumption. There are other queuing/blocking techniques that can help with overload situations. DoS attacks in particular should not be responded to by dropping existing connections in order to feed the attack.

I certainly agree in the DOS case. And I am not knowledgeable in this 
area, so will defer to somebody that is. But at some point one must 
either drop an existing connection or reject a connection request. It 
seems pretty unfair if you end up rejecting connection requests that 
might be important in order to preserve a connection that hasn't been 
used in hours, days, or more.

Unfortunately, what the connection request arrives there is generally no 
good way to tell how important it is. You might be able to decide based 
on what it does after you accept the connection. But that is too late.

As I say, I am no expert here, so I will be happy if somebody can 
specify how this can be handled reasonably if every prospective client 
continually attempts to connect.

This isn't like provisioning a telephone trunk group (circuit group, in 
European terminology), where you know each trunk will eventually be 
freed when the call is complete. In the present case, you either provide 
for every client to be connected or you need a disconnect policy. What I 
suggest is a policy of disconnecting after some period of non-use, 
rather than in response to incoming calls. That prevents "feeding a DOS 
attack".

I've been watching this thread for a while, but wanted to respond to Paul's 
note...

Personalizing a bit, if Spencer says "I've got to set up my connections (and 
do TLS exchanges, but let's ignore that for now) before I need them, because 
I care about setup delays", and Paul says, "I need to close inactive 
connections, because I care about the cost of reserved resources", it's hard 
to see how we're going to both be happy at the same time. Without suffient 
resources, we're only discussing who gives up on their goal first, right?

I'm not sure that any of us are the kind of expert that can put ten pounds 
of flour in a five-pound flour sack, and that's the kind of expert we seem 
to be looking for...

Spencer

Yes, some kind of disconnect policy. The connecting party has to play 
nice in that policy as well. If the connecting party always immediately 
reconnects then the policy doesn't work.

Hopefully, the SIP proxy will not be the only place where DoS attacks
are detected.  There are other places upstream of the proxy where
such attacks can be detected, including edge routers.  Indeed,
DoS detection systems such as D-WARD detect the attack before or
as the attack packets leave the network that the DoS agent resides
on.  Another system called NetBouncer can be positioned at the choke
points of the network and allows packets from only "legitimate"
clients.  Yet another system, Secure Overlay Service, uses an
overlay network; clients are authenticated to it before they
reach servers.  My point is that SIP proxy should not be the only
one burdened with detecting a DoS attack.

Having said that, dropping unused prior connections to accept a new
connection is a fairly effective policy if DoS mechanisms are
deployed elsewhere in the network.

Thanks,

For connection reuse to work, I think there needs to be *some* way for 
the server to say "I'm disconnecting you, and I don't want you to 
reconnect for awhile unless you need to *use* the connection."

A simple way is for that to be the case by default, all the time. If you 
feel you need to maintain a connection you aren't using, outbound is a 
way to do that.

Hmm -- interesting.  An orderly TCP (or TLS) disconnection can
easily signify this intent.

An unorderly, or abrupt TCP (or TLS) disconnection that did not
result in the TCP (or TLS) shutdown handshake could conceivably
mean that the server or some middlebox somewhere crashed, and
the client may re-establish the connection with an alternate
server (if any), or wait a bit before retrying.

There are programmatical techniques that let an implementation
figure out whether or not a socket was closed in an orderly
fashion or abruptly.

Thanks,

Sounds good to me. Then there still has to be an understanding of what 
sort of circumstance justifies the establishment of a new connection. An 
obvious one is that you shouldn't reconnect until you need to send a SIP 
request. For instance and INVITE, or a REGISTER. This can still be 
abused by somebody who "needs" to send an OPTIONS message. So I think 
the notion of "need" needs to be sharpened. I think this is one of those 
things where it could be hard to define formally, but easy to 
distinguish real need from whim when you see it.

Hi, Vijay,

Are we talking TCP RESET here, or something else?

Thanks,

Spencer, who thinks it would be just ducky if we could use ICMP for ANYTHING 
on today's Internet :-(

Greetings,

I'm trying to understand (or arrive at) the consensus concerning early
media offer/answer within sip when no answer SDP or "preview" answer SDP
is included within the 18x response.  And since there was little
activity on the related sipping and sip-implementors threads, I thought
that I'd try the sip working group and the authors of some of the
relevant RFCs.

When not using early-session (rfc3959), is it appropriate to send early
media to offerer without bothering to send an answer SDP or "preview"
answer SDP within the 18x?  (By "preview", I mean not sent reliably.)

There are of course limitations in not sending the SDP.  Some of the
limitations are reflected in rfc3264, rfc3959, rfc3960, and the
following posting.  The following posting also presents potential
reasons why some vendors might have chosen to act this way.

http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sipping/current/msg12640.html


I think that part of my confusion stems from early versions of the early
media drafts indicating things like 18x with sendonly SDP being sent
followed by a 200 with sendrecv SDP.  However after their incorporation
into rfc3261, rfc3262, and rfc3264, I'm uncertain if an SDP needs to be
sent within the 18x.  Based upon rfc3666, the answer does not need to be
sent reliably before acting as answerer.  However if not sent reliably,
does rfc3264 section 6.1 still apply?  And if so, does rfc3264 section
6.1 still apply even when 18x sent without bothering to include the SDP
(the SDP might eventually be sent within an INVITE 200 response)?


Thanks in advance for a response,
Brett


P.S. Sorry about posting my question on yet another email list.

That doesn't seem like a good optimization -- how would
you get an incoming call?

If the UA has already registered, and then the TCP connection
is broken, it's going to need to re-register right away 
anyway, especially if its host stack or its NAT gave it a
different ephemeral port than it had with its last 
registration.  

And even if it doesn't need to re-register, it needs to get 
a connection back up for incoming calls.

Hold on; let's clearly distinguish between the UA-to-proxy connection
and connections between proxies. The latter clearly has this problem
with authentication, since mere connection establishment and sending
messages in no way means authority to receiving messages over that
connection.

The former case is different, since typically the first thing a UA sends
over the connection is a REGISTER, which gets challenged and
authenticated before the connection is "trusted".

So where is the problem?

Cheers,
Aki

As Aki said there is no problem in User Agent - Proxy scenario: 
Challenge the client, do not trust the Location and Via header 
(especially alias parameter) but only the trust the source socket. Use 
the source socket of the REGISTER as contact and you will be fine - no 
security issues.

That's how it is done currently.

There are firewalls which block all UDP traffic - thus you ahve to use 
TCP/TLS.

Dan - everybody is getting this mixed up with outbound. Outbound has its 
own rules. This discussion came about relative to the connection reuse 
draft which is independent of outbound. Connection reuse has different 
rules for TCP and TLS. In the case of TCP, there is no way to verify the 
identity of the source of a connection, so it isn't used for requests in 
the reverse direction. Instead, a separate connection in the other 
direction is required for those. That of course means the technique can 
only be used when it is possible to establish connections in both 
directions. If that isn't possible, then TCP connection reuse isn't a 
sufficient answer, and either TLS or outbound is required.

If the connection is direct from UA to registrar, then perhaps the 
registration is sufficient to authenticate the connection for reverse 
traffic. If the connection is from UA to proxy then the proxy has to 
make leaps of faith to trust the identity of the connection.

I don't recall all the details at the moment, but I know Rohan attempted 
to incorporate this kind of feature into connection reuse a long time 
ago. It was shot down. People went to a lot of trouble to develop 
outbound for this case.

AFAIK the current version of connection reuse is primarily of interest 
for proxy-proxy connections. People keep wanting to apply it to UAs, 
apparently as a poor-man's-outbound. There may be a *few* cases where 
that can work. But attempting to do so is likely to just get people 
confused. I think we would be better off clearly partitioning the 
applicability of these two things.

	Thanks,

A further thought...

I think outbound is in some sense an enhancement to connection reuse, 
with different criteria for when connections should be established as 
well as different criteria for reuse. But while the criteria for 
establishing connections are different, this discussion has identified a 
need for a policy to deal with overload in outbound too - when there are 
more candidates wanting to connect than can be accommodated. It is a 
more serious issue in that case, since when somebody is prevented from 
connecting they also won't be able to receive calls.

A server that uses outbound should probably just refuse connections when 
it has maxed out the number it can support. The UAs that attempt to 
connect will just be out of luck, but then in this case *somebody* has 
to be out of luck.

A server that uses connection reuse without outbound should probably 
attempt to keep some headroom for new connections, by disconnecting some 
connections that haven't been used in a long time. That will allow those 
that need a connection to make one, as long as everybody plays nice and 
doesn't establish connections they don't need.

A server that supports both outbound and connection reuse, and has a 
mixture of peers using one or the other may have some difficulty 
providing equitable service to both types. I'm not sure I want to think 
about that right now.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Elwell
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-04.txt
	Pages		: 24
	Date		: 2007-1-17
	
Because of retargeting of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) dialog-
   forming request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the User
   Agent Server (UAS) can have a different identity from that in the To
   header field.  This document provides a means for that User Agent
   (UA) to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in
   the reverse direction and for that identity to be signed by an
   Authentication Service.  The same mechanism can be used to indicate a
    change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some action in
   the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a gateway.  This
   document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-04.txt

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi.

Can anyone explain how an RFC3261 compliant proxy determines when a 

"302 Moved Temporarily" is received by the proxy whether to
a.    Redirect immediately to the new contact, or
b.    Pass the 302 backwards, allowing the originating UA to retry.
It would seem that a proxy making use of a Redirect Server
would always perform choice (a).

   Can anyone explain how an RFC3261 compliant proxy determines when a 

   "302 Moved Temporarily" is received by the proxy whether to
   a.    Redirect immediately to the new contact, or
   b.    Pass the 302 backwards, allowing the originating UA to retry.
   It would seem that a proxy making use of a Redirect Server
   would always perform choice (a).
   Subsequently, the "new contact" may also reply with a 302...

It can choose to do either, "based on local policy".

Dale

I can't see this being any different with UDP, where the proxy in
between can effectively be an open relay, and has to trust the flows it
relays. 

But I also can't see how this problem is any different for, say, HTTP
proxies. That's why many HTTP proxies are configured to do
proxy-authentication, limit the ports to which clients can CONNECT, etc.
Similar logic can be added to a SIP proxy to ascertain that they not
become a totally open relay. 

The rule of thumb in doing this is that you don't commit expensive
resources, or allow all possible actions to be taken until the
connection, or flow, is considered trusted.

Yes, I agree. As I said in the past, we in practice have two very
different interfaces to a proxy: the client-to-server, and the
server-to-server. Outbound is for the former; conn-reuse for the latter.
Neither one has a problem with TCP, although the way one determines when
to trust a connection is very different for each.

Cheers,
Aki

However, RFC 3261 places restrictions depending on whether the proxy is
responsible for the domain of the existing Request-URI. It can recurse only
if it is responsible for that domain - see 16.5.

(As WG chair)

Draft-ietf-sip-identity-04 has just been submitted to the archive with
one very small punctuation change over the previous version. There were
no comments received on the previous version in regard to resolution of
the last open issue (where we agreed the intent at IETF#67).

I have requested the IESG to publish this document as a proposed
standard, which means that at some point in the future it will go
through IESG review and IESG last call.

The submitted PROTO writeup is as follows:

PROTO writeup for http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-
connected-identity-04.txt: "Connected Identity in the Session Initiation

Protocol (SIP)"

   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
          document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

Keith Drage

The document has been reviewed and is ready for forwarding to IESG for=20
publication.

   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

WGLC was initiated in the SIP WG on draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-01
on=20
4th September 2006 with comments requested by 18th September 2006.

Review was made and comments were received from: Cullen Jennings, Shida=20
Schubert, Francois Audet, Paul Kyzivat, Sietse van der Gaast (with an=20
indication that all had performed a full review of the draft. During the

course of the work comments have also been made by: Denis Alexeitsev,
Ilan=20
Avner, Christer Holmberg, Frank Derks, Hans Person, Jonathan Rosenberg,=20
Rocky Wang, Shida Schubert, Roland Jesske, Georg Mayer, Fredrik Thulin,

Penfield, Mike Hammer, Jeroen van Bemmel, Jon Peterson, Hisham
Khartabil,=20
Martin Dolly, Cullen Jennings, Paul Kyzivat, David Oran, Feng Cao, Henry

Sinnreich, Lavis Zhou, Dan Wing, Eric Rescorla.

There have been two key issues in the discussion that have been resolved
to=20
the satisfaction of the SIP working group, but which are worth
mentioning=20
here:

*	There was early discussion about whether the scope of the work
should=20
be a complete solution to response identity, or whether it should just=20
cover connected identity. During the discussions, it was identified=20
that the complete solution to response identity was a near impossible=20
problem to solve. There is no general solution to authenticating a=20
response except in specific circumstances, i.e. when a TLS connection=20
exists to the UAS. There is also an issue of whether the response is=20
coming from a legitimate location, i.e. if the request had been=20
retargetted. There was a draft-cao-sip-response-identity which was=20
therefore not proceeded with.
*	The document allows the changing of the From header field in a
mid-
dialog request from that given in the initial request. There was=20
discussion on whether changing the value was allowed and whether the=20
lack of compatibility with the now obsoleted RFC 2543 was an issue. It=20
was agreed that this compatibility issue had been adequately addressed=20
when RFC 3261 was published. This has a corresponding impact on the To=20
header field in the other direction. This does not relate to changing=20
the To header field in a retargeted request.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

As a security related document, the document has been reviewed by Eric=20
Rescorla (the security adviser to the SIP working group), and there are
no=20
remaining unresolved issues.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

The document has been well discussed by a significant number of members
of=20
the working group (see answer in 1(b)).

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, these have been
performed=20
as a SIP working group item, and therefore this draft is in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427.

The document passes ID-NITS (idnits 1.123).

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative and informative references are published
RFCs.=20
All the normative references are standards track documents.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
          consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggested a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See
          [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis].  If the document
          describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

Section 6 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new option-tag
is=20
defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent with
RFC=20
3261 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the current=20
format of the registry.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document contains no entries written in formal language. Section 5
of=20
the document makes use of encoded keys within a SIP message body, and
these=20
have been automatically generated using the same tools as for RFC 4474.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

Technical Summary

Because of retargeting of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
dialog-forming=20
request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the User Agent Server
(UAS)=20
can have a different identity from that in the To header field.  This=20
document provides a means for that User Agent (UA) to supply its
identity to=20
the peer UA by means of a request in the reverse direction and for that=20
identity to be signed by an Authentication Service.  The same mechanism
can=20
be used to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because
of=20
some action in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a
gateway. =20
This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).

Working Group Summary

The document complements work already performed in RFC 4474 for=20
authenticated request identity, and forms an integral part of the
chartered=20
work in this area. There is consensus in the working group to publish
this=20
document.

Document Quality

The document has been well discussed by a significant number of members
of=20
the working group.

Personnel

Keith Drage is the document shepherd for this document. Cullen Jennings

In UDP, outbound requests from the registrar go to the registered 
contact address. It has to be resolved by the last proxy, and (in the 
absence of -outbound-) is independent of how the register was delivered.

If you try to reuse a tcp connection for requests in the reverse 
direction, then the destination is the source port for the tcp 
connection, which has no direct relationship to the registered contact. 
There are various exploits for this, that permit somebody to hijack 
requests.

For instance: suppose good UA GUA uses a proxy P and registers to 
registrar R, using AOR sip:gua@r.

Then an evil UA - EUA could collude with an evil server ES to hijack 
requests outbound from R and intended for GUA. It could establish a TCP 
connection to P, and then send a REGISTER To: sip:gua@r, but with a 
Route header that takes it to ES, and with a copy of the contact used by 
GUA. ES then colludes by accepting that registration. At this point, P 
will think that the TCP connection from EUA is a valid path to gua.

The details of this are all tied up in how you decide which requests can 
reuse the tcp connection. You can probably tighten things up to solve 
the above problem. If you work at it enough, I think you will end up 
with something like sip outbound. Rohan attempted, and was shot down. 
You can't just naively say that the connection can be reused for 
requests in the reverse direction.

I don't know much about HTTP implementation, but afaik there is nothing 
like the reverser routing that we are talking about here. So I don't see 
the analogy.

   However, RFC 3261 places restrictions depending on whether the
   proxy is responsible for the domain of the existing Request-URI. It
   can recurse only if it is responsible for that domain - see 16.5.

Interesting -- so other 302's have to be passed back upstream.  And I
suppose the UAC has blanket permission to act on any 3xx.

my proxy does not allow pre-loaded route headers unless there is only
one route header that points to the proxy/registrar itself.

That is fine for you. And if you do that, and perhaps impose some other 
restrictions, then you can probably make the connection reuse in the 
reverse direction safe.

But for us to specify in an RFC how to do connection reuse in the 
reverse direction with TCP will require writing down a whole set of 
restrictions like that. I see that being done - in the outbound draft - 
but not otherwise. If somebody wants to specify yet another way then I 
guess they can do so.

Establishing a connection in one direction in order for it to be used in 
the other direction doesn't belong in the existing connection reuse 
draft because that doesn't do what is needed for it. In the absence of 
something that does, we must assume that independent connections will be 
established in each direction.

Is this something we wish to debate in the IETF?

I mean if an implementation's maximum of TCP connections is insufficient to serve
given number of clients and given traffic, then a policy will not generate the
missing resources, overprovisioning with more boxes will. Reminds me of the old
QoS dilemma: QoS policies don't generate bandwidth, they do create unfairness
rules. Which in this particular case leads to less preferred clients being
disconnected and unreachable. Not sure if thats what we are striving for.

The tough case is DoS-driven overload, however the assumption of being better off
using a cooperative client respecting a policy doesnt help much either.

Very few deployments have absolutely no idea what their expected use will be though. Proper provisioning based on intended usage and empirical evidence is a reasonable assumption. There are other queuing/blocking techniques that can help with overload situations. DoS attacks in particular should not be responded to by dropping existing connections in order to feed the attack.

I'm worried that in interest of accomodating some overcomplicated scenarios we would be 
tempted to make the key mainstream cases difficult too. Running code (not SIP
specifically, BTW) works as follows for sake of being able to deal with NATs and 
firewalls:
- clients makes itself known. This registration request creates TCP or UDP bindings
  underway in NATs, firewalls, middleboxes, what-have-you
- when a message comes back (reply or subsequent requests), it travels symmetrically
  so that bindings underway allow the message to pass through.
- client keeps the "connection" alive periodically

This is implemented this way because it is known to work over NATs and firewalls
(mostly).

>If you try to reuse a tcp connection for requests in the reverse direction, then the destination is the source port for the tcp connection, which has no direct relationship to the registered contact. 

If an implementation is done this way, I would label it suboptimal because 
of its lowered capability to deal with NATs/firewalls.

I think a well behaving client implementation has direct relationship between
contact and transport source. That's very important to get over NATs/firewalls.
There are use-cases in which this doesn't hold but let's for now speak the UA 
maintstream case.

ES then colludes by accepting that registration. At this point, P will think that the TCP connection from EUA is a valid path to gua.

I think that in this scenario the problem is blind trust (no authentication between elements,
unreasonable trust in preloaded Route header fields). I dont think we should consider
such unwise scenarios as a driver for whatever we may wish to do.

I think that we should test against "running code" scenarios. Such as that GUA authenticates with
R over P, R authenticates, and P only considers 200s from R as indication of success.

I mean with the protocol as is, the network design space is quite huge but I don't think that
we shall try to accomodate every allowable design, and we shall particularly avoid considering
suboptimal (even though valid, protocol-wise) network designs as driver for our work.

I'm concurring with the point, it is client's responsibility to keep connections open,
over which incoming requests will be coming. (Which is logical also for the reason,
that if the client is behind a NAT, the server can't even open it, not speaking of
keeping it alive.)

>Vijay responded as I would have - the single TCP connection has major security concerns if used bidirectionally. You should only use TCP if you know you don't have NAT/FW issues, so that a separate TCP connection can be made in the other direction.

here the initial email from Vijay re: connection_reuse:
"For TCP, it is a connection-in-each direction because of the security
properties associated with the TCP transport when used in SIP
(so, you should not open up a TCP connection for REGISTER and
expect to receive requests in the backwards direction over it.)"

Isn't the security concern caused just by the fact that 'alias' is accepted
as part of unathenticated request?

Yes, that's how running code works :-)

It shall be noted that vast majority of other Internet applications is using
this model for clients behind NATs/firewalls to be able to receive incoming
traffic. The transport!=contact capability of SIP is IMO of problematic value
and shall only be used as exception.

I did a read of Outbound-07 and have a few comments for consideration.
Overall this is a solid draft.=20

=20

Regards,

Kevin

=20

Introduction,

First paragraph, Second to last sentence has a typo - Similarly there a
NAT could be present,... I think if you remove 'there' the sentence
would read correctly.

=20

4.2. Initial Registrations

This section seems to cover both initial registration and
re-registration procedures. It might be helpful to break out the
re-registration requirements into a separate section.

=20

4.4.2. Keepalive with STUN

Can you make the text normative? Specifically, if no other keepalive
mechanism is being used and the keepalive parameter is present in the
URI, the UA MUST periodically perform keepalive checks by sending STUN
binding requests...

=20

5.3. Forwarding Requests

The second sentence states,=20

"If the Edge Proxy receives a request where the edge proxy is the host
in the topmost Route header field value, and the Route header contains a
flow token, the proxy compares the flow in the flow token with the
source of the request. If these refer to the same flow, the Edge Proxy
removes the Route header and continues processing the request."

=20

When would this ever occur? This seems to imply that the UA is
originating a dialog initiating request and inserts a route header with
a flow token which identifies the flow the UAC sent the request on.
There are no requirements in the draft indicating the UAC must do so,
further RFC 3327 does not indicate the UAC should include the Path
header received in the response to the REGISTER as a route header in a
dialog initiating response.

=20

Additionally, This section talks about 'if the Edge Proxy determines the
Route header contains a flow token'. How does it determine this? I
assume based on the presence of the 'ob' parameter which was in the Path
header. If this is the case, it might be clearer to indicate if the
Route header contains the 'ob' parameter the Edge Proxy must do xyz...

=20

6. Registrar Mechanisms: Processing REGISTER Requests

First paragraph, suggest restructuring to cover, no sip.instance,
sip.instance only, sip.instance with reg-id and reg-id only. Also, none
of this text is normative. Given it is updating the binding procedures
defined in RFC 3261 it might be useful to make this normative.

=20

Sixth paragraph, why is the registrar required to store the reg-id if
the rules above are invoked and the registrar ignores this parameter?
While this is the simplest thing to do, it affects the re-registration
procedures as the registrar has to remember that it previously ignored
the reg-id and cannot use it to determine which contact to update on
re-registration. I think the intended operation is clear given the text
on initail registration (if the ob parameter in the first path header
entry is absent ignore the reg-id), but the one sentence on
re-registration (same paragraph) does not call out these rules.

=20

Finally, there are no requirements on how the registrar manages the
contacts for a given AOR-instance-id combination. Would it be possible
to add a paragarph to cover registrar contact management in the case it
does not have a direct flow with the UAC?

=20

9. Example Message Flow

The 200 OK responses to the REGISTER requests do not contain the Path
header. Given the UAC is required to support this and can optionally
inspect the value returned in the REGISTER response, its should be
included for completeness.

=20

Message 8 - Why would the Edge Proxy record-route with a flow token?
This is a mid-dialog issue and given it is out of scope of outbound
should not be covered in the message flow, or indicated that the
secondary edge proxy may record-route and optionally include a flow
token with a disclaimer that this may affect mid-dialog failover
capabilities.

See sections 7.4, 18.3, and 20.14 of RFC 3261.  Or just search for

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception. Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page. While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Yes, and section 9.3 of connect-reuse indicates that HTTP Digest
may mitigate a subset of the problems of TCP connection reuse.  But
HTTP Digest cannot be used for proxy-proxy communications.

So what is the answer for reusing TCP connections between proxies
in the face of NATs and firewalls?  The canonical answer is
to use the same connection in the backwards direction because
the NATs will allow data packets through that connection.  But
sending a request through that connection open the proxy to
hijacking...

suggest renaming to "STUN Binding Requests are periodically sent ..."

Why should the UA have a URN if it cannot use it in the signalling ?
Maybe change SHOULD to MUST ?

perhaps a silly questions, but should this interval change for each
keepalive request? I.e. should the UA re-calculate a new random value
for each keepalive request, or should it only calculate it once and
then re-use the same value for all subsequent keepalive requests.

in any case this is implementation specific but might be clarified.


 > 8.  STUN Keepalive Processing
 >

it seems to me that the logic of detecting if the SIP server supports
STUN multiplex is too complex and might lead to buggy implementations
or operational problems.

would it not be better for the client to check the Supported: sip-stun
option tag in the 200 OK response for the REGISTER message?

the behaviour of the SIP server can also change over time, i.e. moving
from old-style SIP server w/o STUN to support sip-stun, and vice versa.
the client will check the sip-stun option tag for each 200 OK and either
enable or disable STUN Binding Discovery.








General comments:

could we also include some example message flows between the Edge Proxy
and the registrar?

Hi

Content length gives only size of the SIP message body like size of SDP
body, but not size of entire SIP message. May be u could calculate the
size of SIP message from UDP/TCP packet level=20

Ranjit

   From: Raj <ponrajit@yahoo.com>

   I want to find a size of a SIP message. Can anyone help me to find
   out the size of a SIP message?

See sections 7.4, 18.3, and 20.14 of RFC 3261.  Or just search for
"Content-Length" in the RFC.

Dale

Come on guys - this is not rocket science!

Starting with the first line of the message, you look until you find 
<cr><lf><cr><lf> to determine the end of the headers for the message, 
after which the body will begin.

Within those headers you look for the Content-Length header. It gives 
the size of the body. So that many more bytes are also part of the message.

In the case of UDP, the message always starts at the beginning of a 
packet, and any extra bytes after the message are to be ignored.

In the case of TCP, immediately after the message you should find the 
beginning of another message. There may be extra <cr><lf> pairs that you 
should ignore between messages.

Of course there are a variety of ways to optimize this processing and 
make it more robust.

The reason we introduce these randomized delays is typically to prevent 
synchronization effects causing/resulting from high congestion.

It is certainly possible to re-caculate the random value for each keepalive 
request, but do people think this is necessary?

Thanks,

Hi all,

I want to start a discussion on a - in my opinion - existing problem
with "roaming" SIP users. Let's describe the problem:
Guess we have two locations at our company. Each location has it's own
SIP proxy (siteA.mydomain.tld and siteB.mydomain.tld) and users homed at
one of theses two proxys. Thus users can register at their home
registration server (their home proxy). So each user can be reached via
sip:<user>@<proxy-at-site>. If the user is at this desk there is no
problem. In case of an arriving call the UA at the registered IP of the
user is invited via SIP. So the call get's established.

Let's guess userA from siteA (sip:userA@siteA.mydomain.tld) is out for=20
hollidays and he want to redirect all his calls to this voicemail box.=20
Then he has a few possibilitys:
(a) set a call redirection at his phone (so the phone sends a
"temporarily moved" message to the proxy, the proxy can redirect the
invite to his new location e.g. voicemailsystem@siteA.mydomain.tld)
(b) ask his administrator for setting a static redirect at the location
server (proxy) at siteA so that it redirects the invite to his new
location e.g. voicemailsystem@siteA.mydomain.tld
(c) use a protocol like DUNDI to find the user in the list of peered
location server (proxys) to redirect the call to these address. (TRIP
also can't solve the problem)
(d) use ENUM and alter the NAPTR record to e.g.=20
voicemail@siteA.mydomain.tld (would only work if a call arrives at his=20
e.164 number, not for "direct" calls to userA@siteA.mydomain.tld)


In my opinion all these posibilities are less satisfactory. The most
interesting thing is a "static" redirect from the proxy server of the
users home location (proxy siteA.mydomain.tld), but the users
administrator would beat us to death.
If we use the redirect from the phone (384 moved temporary) the phone
needs to stay connected to the network (if we use a softphone or want to
use the hardphone for other purposes then the invite could not be
handled by the phone and the proxy doesn't get informed about the moved
user).
DUNDI would not make it possible to support a user moving out of the
dundi administrative domain (e.g the user went out to work at home and
has his sip client at home registerd with a sip provider, e.g.
userA@myprovider.tld) and ENUM would not cover directed calls to
userA@siteA.mydomain.tld.

I think it would be great if we would have a sip command that the
authenticated user could send to his home registration server (proxy or
location server at siteA) and tell this server where the user has
temporary moved to.
This is more efficient than setting this at the phone (if it should=20
persist for more than a short), because of the phone can be turned of or=20
temporary used by another user from siteA.

The same procedure is well known from conventional PBX distributors.
They store the redirect information provided from the user to the phone
in the PBX. So if you disconnect the phone the call redirection is still
active.

I have searched the web for a similar possibility in the SIP RFCs, but
found no coresponding function.

Is this still covered by any RFC and I was not able to found it?
How do you think about this idea for a SIP command that can provide this
functionality?

Thanks for your comments and thoughts on this topic...

Best regards,
Werner

Hi;
CPL can do this.
If userA sends to the Proxy a CPL file with his new Forward preferences,
the proxy will know where to find him ( or where to redirect calls to him=
 )
by applying the rules in the CPL script.

Now the question is if your proxy supports CPL :)
or any other way to configure Forward rules for users
like Forward Unconditional to voice mail.

Regards
Diego B

Werner,

What you are asking for is essentially a standardized implementation of 
a particular service. (Call forward unconditional.) There is a new BOF 
(BLISS) starting up to look at this. That would be a place to go to 
pursue this further.

My main point is that dropping prior connections to accept a new connection=
 is one possible policy, but hopefully not a commonly implemented one. Ever=
y deployment will have some limit. Very few deployments have absolutely no =
idea what their expected use will be though. Proper provisioning based on i=
ntended usage and empirical evidence is a reasonable assumption. There are =
other queuing/blocking techniques that can help with overload situations. D=
oS attacks in particular should not be responded to by dropping existing co=
nnections in order to feed the attack.

Sean - I'm not sure exactly which point you are trying to make.

Certainly one option is to attempt to over configure the system so that
there is enough capacity to accept every connection attempt. In certain
closed environments that may be workable. But it is certainly not a
solution for all environments.

Presumably every deployment will have *some* limit. This limit could be
reached in normal operation if the operators don't have control over the
number of clients attempting to connect. That limit can support more
devices if they don't attempt to keep the connection up all the time
than it can if they do.

The limit can also be reached as a result of devices that malfunction,
or because of a DOS attack. The impact of that may also be worth some
consideration.

Even when provisioning trunk groups, you are not provisioning for every sin=
gle subscriber to be in a call simultaneously. Provisioning needs to be don=
e based on expected usage of course.  A disconnect policy to deal with over=
load and DoS is wise, but it needs to be more sophisticated than FIFO. And =
the client does need to participate or at least have a clear way of determi=
ning when the client is not playing nice.

Yes, some kind of disconnect policy. The connecting party has to play
nice in that policy as well. If the connecting party always immediately
reconnects then the policy doesn't work.

<font size="-1"><font face="Arial"><font color="#3333ff">A stateless
proxy must receive all responses related to a request. Otherwise, the
proxy is not able to know whether a proxied request succeeds, or a
transmisssion error occurs, or the receiving entity died, ...<br>
<br>
Additionally, consider a (stateless) forking proxy: it needs to receive
an answer in one leg in order to cancel the request in the other leg,
for example.<br>
<br>
In general, observe that a request is only 50% of a full transaction.
The minimum set of information any SIP node can proces is a full
transaction. Therefore, in order to correctly process a request, a
stateless proxy must receive and correctly process the answer(s) (e.g.:
100 Trying, 18x, 200 OK) as well. Afterwars, it may safely remain out
of the signalling path of subsequent SIP messages.<br>
<br>
For INVITE requests, the final ACK message may not traverse the
stateless proxy. This is because the ACK is a "special" SIP message,
not exactly a real request as other SIP messages.<br>

  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">RFC 3261 states that even a stateless
SIP proxy must insert a Via entry containing its contact address in SIP
request. Then, a stateless Proxy will receive all SIP responses to a
proxied SIP request. However, in general, a stateless proxy would not
need to receive the SIP responses to a being proxied request.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I would like to konw what is the
functional reason that leaded to mandate Proxy stateless to receive SIP
responses for proxied requests.</font></p>

Hi
How a stateless proxy can fork a request and then cancel one of the legs?
A stateless Proxy has no Transaction memory, so it can not cancel a=20
transaction after receiving a response.
I think a stateless proxy can not fork a request.

This is correct.
A stateless proxy cannot fork.

=20
I can think of a few reasons...
=20
1. the UA (as far as I know) cannot know if a proxy is stateless or =
stateful
    so it has to treat all requests in the same way.
=20
(But even if you did know which proxies were stateful)....
=20
2. Let's say you decide to send the response back without sending it =
back to
    any proxies. To make it work, you think about ripping out all the =
Vias except the bottom one
    and send the response to this remaining Via.
    But then even if you did try to send it to this remaining Via, there =
is no certainty that
    it is directly reachable - it might not have a global IP or hostname =
- especially if the
    request was sent via a stateless edge proxy.
=20
3. for debugging purposes, say you are debugging one of the traversed =
proxies - it is
    easier to debug if you see the request going out and a corresponding
    response coming back.

Responses always follow the request path. Much of the defined  
behavior or SIP and its extensions count on this.
- Responses are sent back over the TCP connection they arrived on
- On UDP, responses are sent back to the apparent sending address  
(received) and if rport is present, the apparent sending port.

If you attempted a different design that allowed the response to  
"skip" nodes in the path, you would
have to rework many of those mechanisms, and you would have to  
introduce new solutions to deal with
situations where A can reach B, B can reach C, but C cannot send  
traffic directly to A (something like what we have with
Record-Route for dialogs).

   How a stateless proxy can fork a request and then cancel one of the legs?
   A stateless Proxy has no Transaction memory, so it can not cancel a 
   transaction after receiving a response.
   I think a stateless proxy can not fork a request.

A stateless proxy can fork, and in some cases, can arrange to do
actions that seem to require keeping state, without actually doing so.

For forking, the simplest case is to do parallel forking -- when the
request comes in, the proxy sends multiple copies to multiple
destinations.  When the responses come in, the proxy forwards them
upstream.  At the worse, the UAC receives multiple responses to its
requests, and has to decide how to handle that, but it has to be able
to do that anyway.

The proxy can also do serial forking -- The proxy needs to save or
encode the incoming request-URI into the Via header, along with the
outgoing request-URI.  When a response comes in, the proxy examines
the Via header to determine the destination set it previously used for
the request, and which destination this response came from.  It can
then decide whether to send another request to the next destination,
or return the response upstream.

Etc.

   RFC 3261 states that even a stateless SIP proxy must insert a Via
   entry containing its contact address in SIP request. Then, a
   stateless Proxy will receive all SIP responses to a proxied SIP
   request.  However, in general, a stateless proxy would not need to
   receive the SIP responses to a being proxied request.  I would like
   to konw what is the functional reason that leaded to mandate Proxy
   stateless to receive SIP responses for proxied requests.

I expect that there are circumstances where a stateless proxy could
safely not add a Via header.  But one reason that you would want to
add a Via header is to ensure addressing:  If A sends the message to
B, and B sends it to C, it's difficult to guarantee that C can send
the response to the sent-by address that A uses in its Via header.

After all, the stateless proxy was probably put into the architecture
to solve some problem, and it probably wasn't to fork and route
requests intelligently.  The most likely reason is to gateway between
two subnetworks with different addressing environments.

This is not correct. A stateless proxy as defined in 3261 is  
explicitly forbidden from forking.
See section 16.11 on page 116:

    A stateless proxy MUST follow the request processing steps described
    in Sections 16.4 through 16.5 with the following exception:

       o  A stateless proxy MUST choose one and only one target from the
          target set.  This choice MUST only rely on fields in the
          message and time-invariant properties of the server.  In
          particular, a retransmitted request MUST be forwarded to the
          same destination each time it is processed.  Furthermore,
          CANCEL and non-Routed ACK requests MUST generate the same
          choice as their associated INVITE.

[DB] Ok; the stateless Proxy actually can fork, but it cannot perform 
the algorithm described in 3261 on selecting the best response, or
canceling the outgoing requests when receiving an OK response or 6xx 
response.

[DB] So, here you actually are saving the state on the Via header. In 
other words, you are
implementing a state full proxy but instead of using the SIP Transaction 
state machine
you are implementation your proprietary state machine.
I would not call this Proxy stateless.

&nbsp;&nbsp; How a stateless proxy can fork a request and then cancel one of the

    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stateless Proxy has no Transaction memory, so it can not cancel a
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; transaction after receiving a response.
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think a stateless proxy can not fork a request.
    <br>
    <br>
A stateless proxy can fork, and in some cases, can arrange to do
    <br>
actions that seem to require keeping state, without actually doing so.
    <br>
    <br>
For forking, the simplest case is to do parallel forking -- when the
    <br>
request comes in, the proxy sends multiple copies to multiple
    <br>
destinations.&nbsp; When the responses come in, the proxy forwards them
    <br>
upstream.&nbsp; At the worse, the UAC receives multiple responses to its
    <br>
requests, and has to decide how to handle that, but it has to be able
    <br>
to do that anyway.
    <br>
    <br>
The proxy can also do serial forking -- The proxy needs to save or
    <br>
encode the incoming request-URI into the Via header, along with the
    <br>
outgoing request-URI.&nbsp; When a response comes in, the proxy examines
    <br>
the Via header to determine the destination set it previously used for
    <br>
the request, and which destination this response came from.&nbsp; It can
    <br>
then decide whether to send another request to the next destination,
    <br>
or return the response upstream.

Hi,
=20
According to RFC3261, a stateless proxy does not maintain a transcation =
state. Then when it receive a SIP response it cannot konw to which =
resquest it does correspond. Moreover, a stateless proxy does not =
perform retransmissions.=20
=20
Here is an extract from FRC 3261/8.2.7:
 A stateless UAS is a UAS that does not maintain transaction state.
 It replies to requests normally, but discards any state that would
 ordinarily be retained by a UAS after a response has been sent.  If a
 stateless UAS receives a retransmission of a request, it regenerates
 the response and resends it, just as if it were replying to the first
 instance of the request.
=20
Best regards

Objet : Re: [Sip] RE: Stateless Proxy and SIP responses


A stateless proxy must receive all responses related to a request. =
Otherwise, the proxy is not able to know whether a proxied request =
succeeds, or a transmisssion error occurs, or the receiving entity died, =
...

Additionally, consider a (stateless) forking proxy: it needs to receive =
an answer in one leg in order to cancel the request in the other leg, =
for example.

In general, observe that a request is only 50% of a full transaction. =
The minimum set of information any SIP node can proces is a full =
transaction. Therefore, in order to correctly process a request, a =
stateless proxy must receive and correctly process the answer(s) (e.g.: =
100 Trying, 18x, 200 OK) as well. Afterwars, it may safely remain out of =
the signalling path of subsequent SIP messages.

For INVITE requests, the final ACK message may not traverse the =
stateless proxy. This is because the ACK is a "special" SIP message, not =
exactly a real request as other SIP messages.

Cheers,

David

	Hi all,=20

	RFC 3261 states that even a stateless SIP proxy must insert a Via entry =
containing its contact address in SIP request. Then, a stateless Proxy =
will receive all SIP responses to a proxied SIP request. However, in =
general, a stateless proxy would not need to receive the SIP responses =
to a being proxied request.

	I would like to konw what is the functional reason that leaded to =
mandate Proxy stateless to receive SIP responses for proxied requests.

relay changes the media endpoint on one side transparently to the other sid=

Folks,

we have submitted new revisions of four URI-list drafts (INVITE, 
MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE, and REFER). The main contents of the drafts have not 
changed. All changes introduced in these revisions have to do with 
document structure, updated references, etc.

The SIP chairs will be requesting the publication of all these drafts 
shortly.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

(As WG chair)

Submitting drafts
-----------------

In association with IETF#68 there are two cutoff dates for WG drafts:

February 26, Monday - Internet Draft Cut-off for initial document (-00)
submission by 09:00 ET (14:00 UTC/GMT)

March 5, Monday - Internet Draft final submission cut-off by 09:00 ET
(14:00 UTC/GMT)

Documents submitted after these dates will not receive discussion in the
meeting.

If you believe you should be submitting a working group charter item as
a -00 draft, then please inform the WG chairs as soon as possible. This
will expedite posting your submission when you come to make it. This
does not apply to individual author drafts.

Agenda time
-----------

We have requested two slots for IETF#68 for the SIP WG. Any agenda
requests should be sent to the WG chairs along with your estimated time.
I assume Dean will be coordinating this as usual and will issue more
specific requests when the draft WG agenda is available.

Finally a reminder that agenda time is primarily for discussing issues
that are not reaching conclusion on the mailing list. Please ensure that
all issues are given the opportunity for discussion on the mailing list
before the meeting. This applies particularly to the editor's of WG
drafts.

Regards

Keith

If you're doing sdescriptions (RFC4568) and have a media relay, you'll =
have
a situation like this, where Alice will be using key AAAA to Bob, and =
Bob
will be using key BBBB to Alice:

   Alice ------ [media relay] ------ Bob

If the media relay, unbeknownst to Alice, switches the media to Carol, =
like
this:

   Alice ------ [media relay]
                             \
                              \
                               \
                              Carol

the media relay can tell Carol Alice's key (AAAA) in the Invite, but =
there
is no way for the media relay to dictate or indicate to Carol that she
should transmit SRTP packets using Bob's old key (BBBB).  Instead, Carol
will choose her own key (let's call it CCCC).  But Alice can't decrypt =
SRTP
media encrypted with CCCC, because Alice doesn't know it.  The only way =
to
get this to work is:

  1. the media relay needs to tell Alice that the call has been=20
     switched from Bob to Carol.
  2. the media relay needs to decrypt Carol's media traffic (using=20
     key CCCC) and re-encrypt it with Bob's old key (BBBB).

The text in the RFC talks about (2). =20

If you want to avoid having the media relay doing SRTP decrypt/encrypt
operations, you need to do (1), which means that Alice will know when =
the
call is switched from Bob to Carol.

Right, scheme (1) as stated would violate the Monica property.
However, what stops the media relay from just doing a re-invite to =20
Alice to force a re-key. Alice will know SOMETHING happened but no =20
whether it was a transfer, and certainly not to whom.

Sure, that would work, if that level of information leakage to
Alice is acceptable.  I agree that it's acceptable in all but
the most severe environments.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Johnston
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-conferencing-01.txt
	Pages		: 14
	Date		: 2007-1-26
	
This document describes how to create a conference using SIP URI-list
   services.  In particular, it describes a mechanism that allows a user
   agent client to provide a conference server with the initial list of
   participants using an INVITE-contained URI-list.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

	Title		: Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-subscribe-01.txt
	Pages		: 10
	Date		: 2007-1-26
	
This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of
   resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of
   resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a
   subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually,
   the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets
   notifications about changes in the resources' state using a single
   SUBSCRIBE dialog.

WGLC was initiated in the SIPPING WG on draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-
subscribe-02 on 12th January 2005 with comments requested by 12th
February=20
2005.

Review was made and comments were received from: Paul Kyzivat. During
the=20
course of the work comments have also been made by: Cullen Jenning,
Avshalom=20
Houri, Dale Worley, Darshan Bildikar.

The document was moved from the SIPPING WG to the SIP WG in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427 because it defines an option tag (this was added at a late
stage in=20
the review process). The document was regarded by the SIPPING WG chairs
as=20
being adequately reviewed and no further review took place in the SIP
WG.=20
The SIP mailing list was polled on this status and no complaint was
made.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session=20
Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no
external=20
review from an external specialist is necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the document.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

Section 1 of the document represents the background to the initiation of

this work, and details a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution
in=20
this area.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, these have been
performed=20
as a SIP working group item, and therefore this draft is in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS the checks against idnits 1.124 report no NITS found.

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative references are now published RFCs except
as=20
follows:
*	reference [5] draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services-06 has been
submitted to=20
the IESG by the SIPPING group as proposed standard.
*	reference [6] draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05 is in the RFC

editor's queue as proposed standard.

There are no informative references.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
          consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggested a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See
          [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis].  If the document
          describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

Section 9.1 changes the existing registration of the purpose header
field=20
parameter to the Call-Info header field by the addition of a reference;
the=20
reason for this is that a new value is added to the the existing
parameter.=20
This registration is consistent with RFC 3968 which defines the registry
and=20
is also consistent with the current format of the registry.

Section 9.2 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new
option-tag=20
is defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent
with=20
RFC 3261 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the
current=20
format of the registry.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document contains no entries written in formal language. While the=20
document makes use of XML within a SIP message body, that XML is defined
by=20
other documents (RFC 4488, draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05), and
used=20
in this specification by reference. Figure 1 and figure 2 contain an
example=20
of this XML usage which is apparently well-formed.

   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes a Document
          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document
          Announcement Writeup?  Recent examples can be found in the
          "Action" announcements for approved documents.  The approval
          announcement contains the following sections:

Technical Summary

This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of
resources=20
in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of resources in the body
of=20
a SUBSCRIBE.  Instead of having a subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE for each=20
resource individually, the subscriber defines the resource list,
subscribes=20
to it, and gets notifications about changes in the resources' state
using a=20
single SUBSCRIBE dialog.

Working Group Summary

The document was originally produced by the SIPPING working group, but
was=20
transferred to the SIP working group due to the need to define a new
option=20
tag, in conformance with RFC 3427. There is consensus in the WG to
publish=20
this document.

Document Quality

There is a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution in this area.=20

This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of
   resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of
   resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a
   subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually,
   the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets
   notifications about changes in the resources' state using a single
   SUBSCRIBE dialog.

   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?  Has the
          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the
          document and, in particular, does he or she believe this
          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?

The document has been reviewed and is ready for forwarding to IESG for=20
publication.

   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members
          and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have
          any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that
          have been performed?

WGLC was initiated in the SIPPING WG on draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-
conferencing-02 on 12th January 2005 with comments requested by 12th=20
February 2005.

No comments were received.

During the course of the work comments have also been made by: Atsushi
Sato,=20
Dean Willis, Darshan Bildikar.

draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-conferencing-05 was extended to refer to
draft-
ietf-sipping-capacity.

The document was moved from the SIPPING WG to the SIP WG in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427 because it defines an option tag (this was added at a late
stage in=20
the review process). The document was regarded by the SIPPING WG chairs
as=20
being adequately reviewed and no further review took place in the SIP
WG.=20
The SIP mailing list was polled on this status and no complaint was
made.

   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document
          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,
          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with
          AAA, internationalization or XML?

The document defines mechanisms that are entirely internal to the
Session=20
Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document shepherd considers that no
external=20
review from an external specialist is necessary.

   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or
          issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director
          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he
          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or
          has concerns whether there really is a need for it.  In any
          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated
          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
          concerns here.

The document defines a new SIP protocol extension for a particular
purpose=20
in a form that has been used for many other extensions. The document=20
shepherd has no concerns with the.

   (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
          represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
          others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and
          agree with it?

There is a strong requirement from OMA for a SIP solution in this area.
The=20
document also forms part of 3GPP Release 7 content.

   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
          discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in
          separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It
          should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is
          entered into the ID Tracker.)

None indicated.

   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/).  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?

The document has been reviewed against the guidelines in RFC 4485 and it
is=20
believed that the document is conformant with those guidelines.

While the document defines a new SIP option tag, these have been
performed=20
as a SIP working group item, and therefore this draft is in conformance
with=20
RFC 3427.

For ID-NITS against idnits 1.124 reports "No nits found".

   (1.h)  Has the document split its references into normative and
          informative?  Are there normative references to documents that
          are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
          state?  If such normative references exist, what is the
          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references
          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If
          so, list these downward references to support the Area
          Director in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].

The document has split its references into normative and informative=20
references. All the normative references are now published RFCs except
as=20
follows:
*	reference [6] draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services-06 has been
submitted to=20
the IESG by the SIPPING group as proposed standard.
*	reference [7] draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05 is in in the
RFC=20
editor queue as proposed standard.
*	reference [8] draft-ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute-03 has been=20
submitted to the IESG by the SIPPING group as proposed standard.

   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA
          consideration section exists and is consistent with the body
          of the document?  If the document specifies protocol
          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA
          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If
          the document creates a new registry, does it define the
          proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
          procedure for future registrations?  Does it suggested a
          reasonable name for the new registry?  See
          [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis].  If the document
          describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?

Section 8 of the document registers a new option-tag; the new option-tag
is=20
defined elsewhere in the document. This registration is consistent with
RFC=20
3968 which defines the registry and is also consistent with the current=20
format of the registry.

   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the
          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML
          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in
          an automated checker?

The document contains no entries written in formal language. While the=20
document makes use of XML within a SIP message body, that XML is defined
by=20
other documents (RFC 4488, draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-05), and
used=20
in this specification by reference. Figure 1, figure 3, and figure 4
contain=20
an example of this XML usage which is apparently well-formed.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi,
What is the status of the "draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics"?  Is it going to be taken forward in SIP WG or is it being planned to be moved to another WG or dropped altogether?

Thanks for the info....

Cheers,

   From: Werner Rades <wrades@bca-itservices.com>

   Let's guess userA from siteA (sip:userA@siteA.mydomain.tld) is out for 
   hollidays and he want to redirect all his calls to this voicemail box. 
   Then he has a few possibilitys:

I don't see what the difficulty is.  Of necessity, any calls to
userA's AOR will be routed through a proxy.  The proxy's first
preference will be to send the call to userA's phone, the second
preference will be to send it to the voicemail system.  So there are
three straightforward ways to handle this situation:

- The user directs the proxy to temporarily remove the phone from the
  list of contacts for the AOR.  (There should be a user interface on
  the proxy for this.)

- There can be a setting on the phone so that it immediately gives a
  4xx response to all incoming calls.  This will cause the proxy to
  immediately send the call to voicemail.

- The user can unplug the phone!  This causes its registration to
  expire, so the proxy will send all calls to voicemail.

The essential philosophical points are:

- The phone is not responsible for routing calls, only for deciding
  whether to accept a call that is routed to it.

- Voicemail is implemented as a second-choice contact point for the
  AOR.

Hi..

I have a simple question..
When 2 SIP UAs have established a dialogue, and they want to exchange text  
infomations..
However this text infomation exchange may be very infrequent, how does SIP  
keepalive between the 2 UAs?
for example, 2 IM(Instance Message)
users may online but talk very infrequent,
--

NAT Traversal Procedure for User Agents


I've implemented a fairly simple but general mechanism for doing NAT
traversal with a User Agent.

1) Open a UDP port for SIP on port number 5060
2) Open a UDP port for RTP on port number 5004
3) Send a STUN binding request out the SIP port
4) Send a STUN binding request out the RTP port
5) Record the IP address and UDP port number returned in the MAPPED-ADDRESS
attribute of the binding request response received on the SIP port (call
this the visible SIP endpoint analagous the the ICE server reflexive 
address)
6) Record the IP address and UDP port number returned in the MAPPED-ADDRESS
attribute of the binding request response received on the RTP port (call
this the visible RTP endpoint)
7) Use the visible SIP endpoint addresses in things like the Contact
header address and the Via header line in outbound requests
8) Use the visible RTP endpoint addresses in the SDP offer for session
establishments

This procedure seems really simple to me and seems to work well with the
limited testing I've done.  It does require the UA to multiplex STUN on
both the SIP and RTP ports but it only requires binding requests so,
again its pretty simple.  This procedure is certainly a lot simpler than
ICE but does not take into account relay servers.

I would be curious on anyone else's experience with a procedure similar
to this.  It sort of seems to take bits and pieces from things in 
various drafts.

Thanks,
FM
