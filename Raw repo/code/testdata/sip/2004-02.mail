I seem to recall discussions a long time ago regarding SIP sessions without
media.
Currently, RFC 3261 is very vague on what these procedures would be. Given
the
offer/answer model, how would a UA receiving an INVITE without an offer know
how to
distinguish between a "delayed-media" case and a "no-media" case? Is there a
specific
session content type  that should be used for this? I cannot find it
documented
anywhere.

Please help.

If one of the messages that is permitted to carry an offer or answer 
contains a body of Content-Type application/sdp, and content-disposition 
of "session", then it is an offer or answer. To conform, the body then 
must actually contain content conforming to the syntax of sdp. If that 
sdp has no m-lines, (or only m-lines with a port of zero) then it is a 
media-less offer or answer.

OTOH, a delayed-media invite contains no sdp at all.

Individual endpoints have to make their own decisions about whether to 
accept no-media invites, and if so how long to keep them around.

Firstly, I'm inclined to back away from my prior suggesting of using 
URIs instead of etags, primarily because I think we are just too far 
along here and "if it aint broke, don't fix it". We can probably get the 
missing piece of functionality - finding out who else is publishing - in 
ways that dont change what we have documented.

Your suggestion below is reasonable towards that end, but makes me 
nervous that it introduces a behavior that is *like* registration, but 
isnt the same (no  contacts in the publish request, for example).

Another possible idea is to create a new event package which is the 
"esc" event package. When you subscribe to a URI for that package, you 
get notified of all published documents made against that URI. The 
current state of the resource for that package is a list of the 
currently active documents for that URI. By doing this as an event 
package, we can leave PUBLISH alone, and add this functionality in the 
future, as a separate item.

Yes, that is true. If media relays are used (i.e., TURN), it might be 
possible to avoid even this, but lets leave that aside for now.

Right. However, it does solve the problem that, previously, if both 
endpoints moved at the same time, the call would fail - neither side 
could signal the other.

Right, in particular, a long lived presence subscription, for example.

I will attempt a wild swing too...
Though we are talking of terminal mobility, it seems to me that this
mobility is restricted because of the fixed routeset in the dialog.
I can see that GRUU mapping to instance id, and the fact that GRUU can be
globally routed, paves a way for an un-restricted terminal mobility, just in
case nobody record-routed.
Was wondering if this could be of any use...

Hi Jonathan,

Thanks a lot for the excellent comments. Most of them I will directly =
fold into -03. Few clarifications below.

Cheers,

I don't quite follow,  but I agree the quoted text is rather vague. To =
me the hard state, or "preconfigured" state is just another source of =
event state to the composer. The mechanism to set that state might be =
other than PUBLISH.=20

I'm not sure I agree. I've understood the RFC editor's policy so that an =
informative reference is not required for implementing the RFC. It's an =
interesting question as to how this relates to RFC 2119 terminology. But =
I think a MAY makes the feature optional so that it fits the informative =
reference definition.

I think the reason for this is that I envisioned a PUBLISH carrying =
state in some other place than the body. However, I don't know if such a =
case would ever exist, and other people have also commented on this. I =
think it is safe to assume that the state is always carried in the body, =
as opposed to "typically".

I'll change the text in 5.2 accordingly.

I think I agree with you. The separate email thread about querying the =

I responded to this separately.=20

Correct. I will add some text to this effect.

The attempt was to make etag generation part of step 9. This way, an =
entity-tag is generated for each successful publication and returned in =
2xx, irrespective of whether the publication was an initial publication, =
a refresh, or a modification. Indeed, a 2xx to a removal could be =
treated the same, although such an entity-tag is useless at that point.

So I think it is ok to exit step 6 without an entity tag, as long as =
step 9 is clear that entity-tags are generated for all successful =
publications.

I don't think there are any. I will reword and remove that part.

=20
I see what you are saying. But is it really so that each new method that =
gets added to SIP needs to explicitly mandate certain security =
mechanisms? At least going beyond the security considerations in RFC =
3261 seems unnecessary, since the properties of PUBLISH are very similar =
to, say, REGISTER.=20

I was hoping we could get by with discussing PUBLISH specific threats, =
and merely referencing relevant parts of RFC3261 when it comes to =
mitigating those threats.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi,

During an attended call transfer attempt, the transferred party
(A-Party) is put on 'hold' by the transferor (B-Party) - i.e. no media
stream flows from B to A and vice versa. While the A-Party is on hold,
the B-Party can INVITE a third party to play 'Music on Hold' tune to the
A-Party until the transfer attempt succeeds. We think that there are
complications in this approach. Firstly, the SIP Proxy must now where to
route the new INVITE generated by the B-Party. If the destination URI is
'moh@someserver.com', the SIP Proxy must either do a DNS query or use
its IP dial-plans to know where to route the call. Secondly, the B-Party
might eventually end-up receiving the music tune whereas it was
initially intended for the A-Party - we've had problems in the past
because of this. This is all dependent on how the third party MOH server
handles/established/terminates requests. 

We think that third party invitation is a bad idea, and it would rather
be more suitable to have a dedicated server (IVR unit perhaps) which the
SIP Proxy Server can transfer calls to/from upon request for a MOH
service. Could you tell us your opinions about this please?

Thanks.

Regards,

I think you are confusing two different concepts.

If it is not normative it is informative.

If it is optional it is not mandatory.

The two concepts are orthogonal.

By capitalizing the "MAY" you are emphasizing that this is a requirement, and therefore normative, even though it is an optional requirement.

Keith

Hello all,
In RFC 3398, page 16, what do you think the cause code should be in the
REL sent to the PSTN network after interwork tinmer expires ?
Thanks a lot for your help
Ali

I have the following remarks regarding the GRUU draft:

1. The draft states that one of the GRUU properties is =20
"   o It MUST NOT be possible, based on inspection of the URI, to
determine the associated Contact URI or Address of Record."

It MUST be possible to achieve such a property for a GRUU (if the
Registrar wants to enforce such a policy for its domain), but it is not
part of the requirements for the GRUU concept to always enforce such a
policy.

2. It is expressed throughout the draft that=20
"This extension allows a UA to obtain a GRUU, and to use a GRUU. These
two mechanisms are separate, in that a UA can obtain a GRUU in any way
it likes, and use the mechanisms in this specification to use them.
Similarly, a UA can obtain a GRUU but never use it."

For consistency, I suggest in section "6.2 Using the GRUU" change the
first sentence from

   "A UA first obtains a GRUU using the procedures of Section 6.1."
to=20
   "A UA first obtains a GRUU using the procedures of Section 6.1 or by
other means".

Thanks,
Orit.

Yes, that is true. If media relays are used (i.e., TURN), it might be=20
possible to avoid even this, but lets leave that aside for now.

Right. However, it does solve the problem that, previously, if both=20

could signal the other.

Right, in particular, a long lived presence subscription, for example.

I have to admit I concur with this position. There might be very useful 
situations where the anonymity aspect of the GRUU would be undesirable.

I can even envision models where the GRUU is cryptographically 
validatable as representing an instance associated with a specific AOR, 
including variations where the validation can or cannot be done without 
prior knowledge of the associated AOR.

As far as I can tell, reversibility does not impact the given rationale 
for the requirements, that:

    With these rules, it is possible, though not required, to construct a
    GRUU without requiring the maintenance of any additional state. To do
    that, the URI would be constructed in the following fashion:

So I believe I would support making this a SHOULD strength requirement. 
Conceivably some discussion of the security implications of NOT meeting 
this requirement would be appropriate.

Right. I agree with that. Let me try again. Requoting the paragraph:

    PUBLISH requests create soft state in the ESC. This state has a
    defined lifetime and will expire after a negotiated amount of time,
    requiring the publication to be refreshed by subsequent PUBLISH
    requests. Local policy at the compositor may in turn define hard
    state for a particular event package. That is, the steady-state of
    this event package in the absence of, or in addition to, soft state
    provided through the PUBLISH mechanism. Setting this hard state or
    configuring the composer policy is out of the scope of this
    specification.

The words "hard state for a particular event package" read to me like it 
meant that hard state was defined on a package by package basis. But, 
its not. There would be hard state generally for a particular 
URI/package basis. So, I'd suggest:

     There may also be hard state provisioned for each resource for
     a particular event package. This hard state represents the resource
     state that is present at all times, and does not expire.


My other comment was that the concept of "for each resource for each 
package" is a common concept, for which I was looking for a term to define.

No - Keith is right in his note. Think of it this way - would the 
feature interop if, one day, the referenced I-D evaporated and people 
implemented it differently? In this case, no. If they chose to implement 
the content indirection, and there was no spec, they would do it 
differently and there would be no interop.

I would just drop the text to avoid the dependency.

Yes.

Step 8 requires an entity tag to be defined, however.

I have made this same comment in past discussions of specs going through 
iesg. However, the security ADs believe strongly in reptition of 
security requirements in specifications. Trust me, you WILL get dinged 
on this. It is much easier to just add text stating the same normative 
requiremetns as in rfc3261, then to get a discuss during iesg evaluation.

I am ok to lessen the requirement.

The question becomes, do we want a way to allow the client to signal 
that a randomized gruu is desired, or is it up to the server? I would 
much prefer to leave it up to the server, in which case the only thing 
that we need to change is the requirement, above. I changed the text to 
read:

<t>In many cases, it will be desirable to construct the GRUU in such a
way that it will not be possible, based on inspection of the URI, to
determine the associated Contact URI or Address of Record. Whether or
not a GRUU should be constructed with this property is a local policy
decision of the administrator.
</t>

OK, with the addition of "outside the scope of this specification.".

No. The *definitive* document is RFC3261 and related documents. The 
details of call control are derivative from that in somewhat the same 
way the much of physics is derivative from F=MA.

Draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-05.txt is (not surprisingly) an 
*example*. It is not normative.

However, that draft is certainly helpful and educational. You would do 
well to understand what is in there before completing your task.

Hi folks,
   It's an interesting point.
Paul's comment seems to be "there are many different ways of skinning a 
cat, and the
only normative definition is of the knife".
The IETF defines the details of knife behaviour, and it's up to 
everyone else to sort
out how to use it for their purpose.

My understanding is that the IETF (and the SIP WG in particular) will 
not produce normative
definitions of these (or any other) teleservices, only definitions of 
protocol elements that
might be used for these (or other) purposes.
SIPPING will consider such services and decide on the protocol elements 
they think are needed
(that don't exist already) and then SIP grinds through the details.

Thus the only teleservice examples are in the service-examples document 
(collected together
as a convenience), these are non-normative, and there will never BE 
normative teleservice
definitions produced by these groups. Is this correct?

all the best,
   Lawrence

This vagueness makes it very difficult to engineer a telephony solution
which interoperates with other vendors equipment. In the telephony arena
getting call transfer right is of fundamental importance. A simple document
titled "Call transfer in SIP" would suffice in de-mystifying this area.

Lawrence - remember that SIP is a transport protocol which allows an
objective to be reached in many differing ways.  There is no correct
behavior in many scenarios as long as they fall between the guidelines
set out.  It would be wrong to define normative behavior for such
scenarios and so a push in the right direction towards preferred methods
is the best approach.

Chris.

Hi Chris, folks,
   That's what I said - the SIP/SIPPING groups will not produce normative
teleservice definitions - we're in TSV and a teleservice is in/above 
APPs.

I do sympathise with those folks who want a definition so they can 
interwork
with other vendor's kit in implementing those teleservices.

Short answer is - yup - it would be a good idea, but not by the IETF.

I note in passing that Alan Johnston works for a fine Telecom Service 
Provider
that might be expected to have an interest in the way teleservices are 
implemented
by different vendors.

all the best,
   Lawrence

I am ok to lessen the requirement.

The question becomes, do we want a way to allow the client to signal=20
that a randomized gruu is desired, or is it up to the server? I would=20
much prefer to leave it up to the server, in which case the only thing=20
that we need to change is the requirement, above. I changed the text to=20
read:

<t>In many cases, it will be desirable to construct the GRUU in such a
way that it will not be possible, based on inspection of the URI, to
determine the associated Contact URI or Address of Record. Whether or
not a GRUU should be constructed with this property is a local policy
decision of the administrator.

OK, with the addition of "outside the scope of this specification.".

This works for me. You might even strike " of the administrator" from 
the  end.

So, I might ask, would it be worth encouraging our friends at SIP Forum

Sbastien and Roland,

I apologize for the delay in responding.  

You are correct in that one privacy aspect currently addressed for
History-Info is around the UA's ability to require privacy for elements of a
message that can somehow divulge information about the end client's
identity. In some ways, History-Info could be considered in the category of
Record Route,  Via, etc.  However, HI is an optional header and per the
recommendation in RFC 3323, the decision was made that if Header privacy was
requested, then History-Info SHOULD not be included.   In addition, if
through local policy or some other local information available wrt the
retargeted URIs, there is knowledge that there should be privacy applied to
these URIs, then as discussed in RFC 3323, the intermediary processing that
request can also add the Privacy header to ensure that History-Info is also
not captured by subsequent intermediaries.  This latter point perhaps is not
so clearly or explicitly spelled out in the current document in the privacy
sections, but there is discussion in the detailed proxy processing behaviour
in 2.3.3 that the local policy can define whether the History-Info captured
would leave a specific domain (this is of course for optionality, as well,
which is another issue that I'll address in a separate email).      

It seems that what's being discussed in these emails is introducing a
specific privacy tag against those entries that local policy defines should
not be forwarded outside a specific domain,  so that they can be removed
(and don't need to be kept persistent by a privacy service).  Right now,
there's an asumption that these entries are somehow known by the proxy, but
perhaps an explicit tag would be useful.  OR are you talking about extending
the current model in RFC 3323 to specifically address the use of a privacy
service for History-Info headers?

I fully support this proposal. 

The privacy regarding the history-info header relates to the privacy policy
accorded to the target of the request (before it is retargeted). Therefore
it shall not depend on the privacy policy accorded to the calling UA. The
history-info header shall have its own privacy value. 
Moreover in case the request is retargeted more than once (particularly if
the targets represent different users), it shall be possible to request
privacy for a target independently of the others.

Dear all,
in 1.3 Ensuring the Privacy of History_Info it is proposed to use a
priv-value of Session or Header level privacy. I would like to propose a own
privacy level for the history info, because the Information shows also
information about the network. With regard to the provider operating a
network some of the providers don't like to transmit information about call
history. Or a redirecting party don't like to show the redirecting address.
Therefore it should be possible to delete the history info at domain
boundaries based on the privacy-value.

I propose the priv-value   =   "history_info"  for the whole History-Info
header.

In addition a option would be useful where only parts (e.g Indes1.1) of the
history info are restricted. That could be done with a privacy statement
within the History-Info .

Best Regards

Roland

Hi
Even if UAC does not support timer and ignores sesssion expires header
in a 2xx response, a session could be refreshed in case that UAC can response
a 2xx to re-INVITE from UAS. If UAC is not able to recongize a difference between
INVITE and re-INVITE and responds 4xx to the request of the refresh, a session
would be terminated. It depends just upon the implementation of UAC, doesn't it?

PS.The table 2 Jonathan mentioned below is the Figure 3 in draft-13 but it is still 
called table 3 in text page20.

Maybe the author of "Draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-05.txt" could
confirm how definitive the message flows regarding call transfer are
therein. (Or point out a preferred document of reference).

Hi Chris, folks,
   That's what I said - the SIP/SIPPING groups will not produce normative
teleservice definitions - we're in TSV and a teleservice is in/above 
APPs.

I do sympathise with those folks who want a definition so they can 
interwork
with other vendor's kit in implementing those teleservices.

Short answer is - yup - it would be a good idea, but not by the IETF.

I note in passing that Alan Johnston works for a fine Telecom Service 
Provider
that might be expected to have an interest in the way teleservices are 
implemented
by different vendors.

all the best,
   Lawrence

Why would the caller reject the re-INVITE?

It is true that the signaling path would be nailed down. This might be 
problematic for cases where a user roams into a totally different 
service provider, and that provider requires signaling to go through 
their signaling network in order for media to flow through their access 
network.

In such a case, what makes sense is for the client to generate a totally 
new INVITE, and use Replaces to replace the dialog at the called party. 
The original dialog is then torn down. Lest people complain about 
billing implications, the replaces header would allow for sufficient 
correlation of the two dialogs to account for this as if it was still 
one single call.

I have a question about the proxy behavior under the following scenario,
could someone please provide a clarification.

1. UAC sends an INVITE via proxy.
2. Proxy responds back with 100 trying message to UAC and forwards INVITE to
UAS.
3. UAS sends 200 OK which is relayed by the proxy to UAC.
4. UAC sends an ACK which is being processed by the proxy to be forwarded to
the UAS.
** Here ACK has sequence number 1
5. UAC sends another INVITE and incidentally this gets forwarded to the UAS
before the ACK from previous INVITE by the proxy.
** Here INVITE has sequence number 2
6. Since UAS did not receive the ACK for previous INVITE (nor did it
received CANCEL/BYE), but received another INVITE with same Call-ID etc. it
throws a "500 Internal Server Error" error.

According to RFC 3261, the UAS behavior to throw a "500 Internal Server
Error" is correct. But I am not sure about the proxy behavior here, could
not be clearly figured out of 3261.

Is proxy supposed to correlate all the messages based on the sequence number
and call-id and essentially send an ACK before sending out second INVITE. Or
they are completely different transactions and this is a normal proxy
behavior.

Thanks,

Rajesh.

Two points:

-	Standardisation of protocol by information flow is not a good idea.

-	The underlying IETF protocol standards (REFER etc) must be complied with, and with creation of a separate set of standards, this may well be bypassed.

I'm in the process of updating History Info
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-history-info-01.txt)
based upon a few comments I've received and merging the requirements into
the solution document.  However, I really need more feedback from the
working group to address the primary point raised during the discussion in
Minneapolis on the optionality.  Initial analysis way long ago resulted in
the decision that Local Policy was the best approach to the optionality,
since it didn't seem reasonable to use Require for an optional header and
lack of the header should not prevent a basic request from being processed.
However, a concern has been raised that Local Policy isn't sufficient as it
requires coordination between clients and proxies (i.e. there's no aspect of
the protocol that allows a client to define or discover that the Proxy will
add the header).  Supported, of course, is used to let the Proxy know that
the information, if available, should be included in the responses.  

In taking a few steps back and re-evaluating all the possibilities for
making the optionality more under the control of the protocol and I came up
with the following list of possibilities. It may not be complete, nor are
the list of pros and cons intended to be exhaustive, but I think it serves
as a useful basis for discussion.

1) Use Require 
Pros: 
- Puts the use of the header explicitly under control of the client
initiating the request. 

Cons: 
- Seems extremely restrictive and functionally limiting, although it would
depend upon the application at the end client that wants to make use of the
information as to how detrimental this might be. 
- Doesn't make sense since the applicability of History-Info isn't
restricted to the initiator of the request. 


2) Make use of the Request-Disposition header field as defined in the caller
preferences draft to explicit request History-Info be included:
history-directive

Pros: 
- Consistent with the intent of that header in that it's a mechanism for a
client to request how a server/proxy should handle a request 

Cons:
- that field isn't extensible 
- doesn't really accomplish more than what can be implied by the Supported
header (i.e. if the client wants the information in a response, then if a
server is capable of adding the header, it SHOULD). 

3) Make use of or define something similar to the Session specific policy,
whereby the client "authorizes" a proxy to capture History-Info and that
it's only captured in that case.   

Pros:
- Explicit.

Cons:
- Seems like a lot of overhead, with little advantage. 

4) Follow the approach of existing optional SIP headers added by
intermediaries (e.g. Path and Reason), which is that it's purely a local
policy decision and doesn't require any coordination with the UA as to
whether it should or shouldn't be added. 

Pros: 
- It's fairly straightforward and consistent with the intent of optional
headers.

Cons: 
- Does require some guidelines to ensure that applications that might use
the optional information are robust enough to handle the lack of
information. 

Feedback on these proposals is appreciated and hopefully this discussion
will allow us to reach a final, constructive conclusion.  

Obviously, my preference is the 4th option and perhaps one reason why we've
gotten so stuck on this point is that the guidelines for applications on the
usage of the header are perhaps not obvious.  So, it might be useful to add
an additional section to the document (or perhaps include additional
information for each of the scenarios in the appendix) on application
guidelines around the usage of the information and default behavior if the
information is not available.

Hi,
   My setup is like this:   =20

      UA1----->(TLS)----->Proxy------>(UDP)--->UA2

Here UA1 makes call and dialog gets established between UA1 and UA2. =
Contact of UA2 contains transport parameter tls (Contact: =
sip@ua1.com;transport=3Dtls). Now when UA2 generates BYE it doesn't put =
any transport parameter in request URI (BYE sip:ua1.com SIP/2.0). =
Because of no transport parameter BYE doesn't get 200OK.
Now my question is which transport (TLS or UDP) UA2 should put in =
request URI?
RFC 3261 says that in request message agent should put transport =
parameter in request URI with transport which it is using.
If I put transport=3Dudp in request URI UA2 BYE doesn't get 200OK, but =
in case of transport=3Dtls it works fine.

I appreciate your help.
Thanks,
Vijay

Hi,
   My setup is like this:   =20

      UA1----->(TLS)----->Proxy------>(UDP)--->UA2

Here UA1 makes call and dialog gets established between UA1 and UA2. =
Contact of UA1 contains transport parameter tls (Contact: =
sip@ua1.com;transport=3Dtls). Now when UA2 generates BYE it doesn't put =
any transport parameter in request URI (BYE sip:ua1.com SIP/2.0). =
Because of no transport parameter BYE doesn't get 200OK.
Now my question is which transport (TLS or UDP) UA2 should put in =
request URI?
RFC 3261 says that in request message agent should put transport =
parameter in request URI with transport which it is using.
If I put transport=3Dudp in request URI UA2 BYE doesn't get 200OK, but =
in case of transport=3Dtls it works fine.

I appreciate your help.
Thanks,
Vijay

Having tried to implement HTTP Authentication for SIP, we faced a few =
problems. This draft tries to highlight those problems and in some cases =
suggests a solution.

Please read and comment.

Thanks,

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the =
username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-khartabil-sip-auth-analysis-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html=20

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Hi all,

I have two tiny questions concerning RFC3398.

In  7.1.6 , what do you think the cause code should be in the REL sent
to the PSTN network after interwork tinmer expires ? =20

On the other hand, in 8.2.3, it says that upon receipt of a SIP 181
response, the gateway should send an early ACM to the PSTN side, plus a
CPG with event code 6. What is the use of CPG since the other side will
already know that its call is beying handled when it receives a early
ACM ? Is the CPG mandatory ?

Thanks a lot=20

Subject: [Sip] draft-ietf-sip-gruu-00

I have the following remarks regarding the GRUU draft:

1. The draft states that one of the GRUU properties is =3D20
"   o It MUST NOT be possible, based on inspection of the URI, to
determine the associated Contact URI or Address of Record."

It MUST be possible to achieve such a property for a GRUU (if the
Registrar wants to enforce such a policy for its domain), but it is not
part of the requirements for the GRUU concept to always enforce such a
policy.

2. It is expressed throughout the draft that=3D20
"This extension allows a UA to obtain a GRUU, and to use a GRUU. These
two mechanisms are separate, in that a UA can obtain a GRUU in any way
it likes, and use the mechanisms in this specification to use them.
Similarly, a UA can obtain a GRUU but never use it."

For consistency, I suggest in section "6.2 Using the GRUU" change the
first sentence from

   "A UA first obtains a GRUU using the procedures of Section 6.1."
to=3D20
   "A UA first obtains a GRUU using the procedures of Section 6.1 or by
other means".

Thanks,
Orit.

Yes, that is true. If media relays are used (i.e., TURN), it might =
be=3D20
possible to avoid even this, but lets leave that aside for now.

Right. However, it does solve the problem that, previously, if both=3D20
endpoints moved at the same time, the call would fail - neither =
side=3D20
could signal the other.

Right, in particular, a long lived presence subscription, for example.

I have to admit I concur with this position. There might be very useful=20
situations where the anonymity aspect of the GRUU would be undesirable.

I can even envision models where the GRUU is cryptographically=20
validatable as representing an instance associated with a specific AOR,=20
including variations where the validation can or cannot be done without=20
prior knowledge of the associated AOR.

As far as I can tell, reversibility does not impact the given rationale=20

    With these rules, it is possible, though not required, to construct =
a
    GRUU without requiring the maintenance of any additional state. To =

Right. I agree with that. Let me try again. Requoting the paragraph:

    PUBLISH requests create soft state in the ESC. This state has a
    defined lifetime and will expire after a negotiated amount of time,
    requiring the publication to be refreshed by subsequent PUBLISH
    requests. Local policy at the compositor may in turn define hard
    state for a particular event package. That is, the steady-state of
    this event package in the absence of, or in addition to, soft state
    provided through the PUBLISH mechanism. Setting this hard state or
    configuring the composer policy is out of the scope of this
    specification.

The words "hard state for a particular event package" read to me like it =

meant that hard state was defined on a package by package basis. But,=20
its not. There would be hard state generally for a particular=20
URI/package basis. So, I'd suggest:

     There may also be hard state provisioned for each resource for
     a particular event package. This hard state represents the resource
     state that is present at all times, and does not expire.


My other comment was that the concept of "for each resource for each=20
package" is a common concept, for which I was looking for a term to =
define.

No - Keith is right in his note. Think of it this way - would the=20
feature interop if, one day, the referenced I-D evaporated and people=20
implemented it differently? In this case, no. If they chose to implement =

the content indirection, and there was no spec, they would do it=20
differently and there would be no interop.

I would just drop the text to avoid the dependency.

Yes.

Step 8 requires an entity tag to be defined, however.

I have made this same comment in past discussions of specs going through =

iesg. However, the security ADs believe strongly in reptition of=20
security requirements in specifications. Trust me, you WILL get dinged=20
on this. It is much easier to just add text stating the same normative=20

evaluation.

I am ok to lessen the requirement.

The question becomes, do we want a way to allow the client to signal=20
that a randomized gruu is desired, or is it up to the server? I would=20
much prefer to leave it up to the server, in which case the only thing=20
that we need to change is the requirement, above. I changed the text to=20
read:

<t>In many cases, it will be desirable to construct the GRUU in such a
way that it will not be possible, based on inspection of the URI, to
determine the associated Contact URI or Address of Record. Whether or
not a GRUU should be constructed with this property is a local policy
decision of the administrator.

OK, with the addition of "outside the scope of this specification.".

No. The *definitive* document is RFC3261 and related documents. The=20

way the much of physics is derivative from F=3DMA.

Draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-05.txt is (not surprisingly) an=20

Hi folks,
   It's an interesting point.
Paul's comment seems to be "there are many different ways of skinning a=20
cat, and the
only normative definition is of the knife".
The IETF defines the details of knife behaviour, and it's up to=20
everyone else to sort
out how to use it for their purpose.

My understanding is that the IETF (and the SIP WG in particular) will=20
not produce normative
definitions of these (or any other) teleservices, only definitions of=20
protocol elements that
might be used for these (or other) purposes.
SIPPING will consider such services and decide on the protocol elements=20
they think are needed
(that don't exist already) and then SIP grinds through the details.

Thus the only teleservice examples are in the service-examples document=20
(collected together
as a convenience), these are non-normative, and there will never BE=20
normative teleservice
definitions produced by these groups. Is this correct?

all the best,
   Lawrence

This vagueness makes it very difficult to engineer a telephony solution
which interoperates with other vendors equipment. In the telephony arena
getting call transfer right is of fundamental importance. A simple =
document
titled "Call transfer in SIP" would suffice in de-mystifying this area.

Lawrence - remember that SIP is a transport protocol which allows an
objective to be reached in many differing ways.  There is no correct
behavior in many scenarios as long as they fall between the guidelines
set out.  It would be wrong to define normative behavior for such
scenarios and so a push in the right direction towards preferred methods
is the best approach.

Chris.

I have a general query:

Stateless HTTP protocol is currently used beyond its original purpose =
i.e. ad-hoc access of information on web without any access-control =
restrictions etc. Variety of techniques are used like cookies, http =
redirects for mimicking user session with web site as well as for =
identity management and SSO (Liberty).

SIP seems to be a fit for streamlining majority of these issues around =
user-web site http interactions. i.e. a scenario could be described as: =
user opens a SIP session with web site, negotiates preferences etc. =
using SDP. Then the session between user-website can consist of http, =
RTP and other streaming protocols as necessary.  SIP can be mediated by =
the service provider/telcos (similar to telcos providing SIP based =
signalling infrastructure for establishment of VoIP/MoIP services)  for =
establishing trust relationships between the user and the web-site, for =
charging  as well as for providing QoS for the transport of traffic in =
the SIP session (using appropriate QoS signalling).

Is SIP directly or indirectly used in this space? If not, was it =
considered before and rejected? If rejected, what were the issues?

Is there any other session control protocol under development for this =
space? When Http used for SOAP in web services interactions, does the =
notion of session gets formalised via any of the related web services =
protocols?=20

I thought that a response to re-INVITE was a part of spec of session timer.
That is independent on session timer specification. I understood the reason
why the session timer works even if a peer doesn't support it.

SIP is no more suited to providing a session for those purposes than
HTTP already is.

UPDATE is a target refresh request, which means it updates the remote 
target (i.e., the Contact). That means, like INVITE, it needs to contain 
a contact.

Jonathan
Since INVITE establishes the target information, it is clear why it is
mandatory on the INVITE.
In subsequent rerquests withina dialog, the Contact need not be mandatory.
If the remote traget is to be changed, then the Contact must be specified,
otherwise not. What is broken if UPDATE does not have a Contact? What
functionality is lost?

My understanding for making Contact mandatory on a re-INVITE, was to avoid
making re-INVITE any different from an INVITE.

It is not a terribly onerous thing to provide Conatct on an UPDATE (and its
200), but I wish to understand what is achieved by doing it and what is lost
by not doing it.

Regards,
Venkat

re-INVITEs are part of rfc3261. Thus, an rfc3261 compliant UA will 
respond to a reinvite, and it shouldn't reject it for no reason.

Hello,

 

            I have a question about CallId. Suppose two UA's generate
callid's putting theire hostnames and send to firewall/NAT.

            UA1:INVITE

                  CallID: call1@192.10.10.10 <mailto:call1@192.10.10.10> 

            UA2: INVITE

                     CallId: call1@192.10.10.12 <mailto:call1@192.10.10.12> 

            

            Because those callid information contain IP addresses, the
firewall/NAT should translate these IP addresses by putting it's own IP in
callId. The callId's are changed to call1@firewall_ip, call1@firewall_ip.
When responses come back from their respective UAS's the firewall/NAT
translates the it's IP address in callId's to their original IP's. My
question is should I change the string "call1" to something generated by
firewall or Is it OK to leave like that. Even though they have same CallId,
the proxy should discriminate the calls by from-tag, callid, and to-tag.

According to Spec, any UA should have a different means of generating
callid's with those of other UA's. 

 

Anything to do correctly to the above procedure?

 

Thanks in advance,

Anil

:-) That's the reason why we started to AVOID IP addresses in the call =
ID!!!

=20

Well I guess the firewall which is changing the Call-ID is a half-way
implementation of an application layer firewall. What it is doing is =
simply
junk and it's a miracle if it's working with any SIP compliant devices.

=20

The "call1" part should be significantly random to avoid using the same
call-ID. That's why most of the user agents chose a call ID that is
random-generated.

firewall/NAT should translate these IP addresses by putting it's own IP =

I am inclined to agree with this. I honestly cannot remember why we 
chose {1/3,10s}. Indeed, this rule actually contradicts RFC3261! From 
section 12.2.1.2:

12.2.1.2 Processing the Responses

    The UAC will receive responses to the request from the transaction
    layer.  If the client transaction returns a timeout, this is treated
    as a 408 (Request Timeout) response.

    The behavior of a UAC that receives a 3xx response for a request sent
    within a dialog is the same as if the request had been sent outside a
    dialog.  This behavior is described in Section 8.1.3.4.

       Note, however, that when the UAC tries alternative locations, it
       still uses the route set for the dialog to build the Route header
       of the request.

    When a UAC receives a 2xx response to a target refresh request, it
    MUST replace the dialog's remote target URI with the URI from the
    Contact header field in that response, if present.





Rosenberg, et. al.          Standards Track                    [Page 75]

RFC 3261            SIP: Session Initiation Protocol           June 2002


    If the response for a request within a dialog is a 481
    (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) or a 408 (Request Timeout), the UAC
    SHOULD terminate the dialog.  A UAC SHOULD also terminate a dialog if
    no response at all is received for the request (the client
    transaction would inform the TU about the timeout.)

In other words, it recommends exactly the behavior you are describing - 
on transaction timeout, terminate the dialog.

I think the spec should state that no entity can request a session timer 
below 1 minute.

The NAT/FW must not go changing this stuff. If it does, a S/MIME signed
sipfrag will fail. There is no need for the NAT to go change call IDs

Hi Ali,
I think this is a wrong description of ISUP Procedures on the outgoing ISUP side. If you are looking in Q.732.2-5 you will find the correct description of call forwarding scenarios. 
You will never find a situation were a ACM and a CPG will be send in backward direction at once, because all information will be given in the early ACM.
The "Generic notification indicator" will be set to "Call is a diverting call" that's all. No CPG is now needed to indicate the same.

With regard to the timer expiry please look in Q.1912.5 there you will find detail information. (e.g. T7 --> 484 Address Incomplete, T9-->480 Temporarily Unavailable...)

I hope this helps.

Best Regards

Roland

Betreff: [Sip] Some details in RFC 3398


Hi all,
I have two tiny questions concerning RFC3398.
In  7.1.6 , what do you think the cause code should be in the REL sent to the PSTN network after interwork tinmer expires ?  
On the other hand, in 8.2.3, it says that upon receipt of a SIP 181 response, the gateway should send an early ACM to the PSTN side, plus a CPG with event code 6. What is the use of CPG since the other side will already know that its call is beying handled when it receives a early ACM ? Is the CPG mandatory ?
Thanks a lot

Betreff: [Sip] Optionality for History-Info


I'm in the process of updating History Info
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-history-info-01.txt)
based upon a few comments I've received and merging the requirements into
the solution document.  However, I really need more feedback from the
working group to address the primary point raised during the discussion in
Minneapolis on the optionality.  Initial analysis way long ago resulted in
the decision that Local Policy was the best approach to the optionality,
since it didn't seem reasonable to use Require for an optional header and
lack of the header should not prevent a basic request from being processed.
However, a concern has been raised that Local Policy isn't sufficient as it
requires coordination between clients and proxies (i.e. there's no aspect of
the protocol that allows a client to define or discover that the Proxy will
add the header).  Supported, of course, is used to let the Proxy know that
the information, if available, should be included in the responses.  

In taking a few steps back and re-evaluating all the possibilities for
making the optionality more under the control of the protocol and I came up
with the following list of possibilities. It may not be complete, nor are
the list of pros and cons intended to be exhaustive, but I think it serves
as a useful basis for discussion.

1) Use Require 
Pros: 
- Puts the use of the header explicitly under control of the client
initiating the request. 

Cons: 
- Seems extremely restrictive and functionally limiting, although it would
depend upon the application at the end client that wants to make use of the
information as to how detrimental this might be. 
- Doesn't make sense since the applicability of History-Info isn't
restricted to the initiator of the request. 


2) Make use of the Request-Disposition header field as defined in the caller
preferences draft to explicit request History-Info be included:
history-directive

Pros: 
- Consistent with the intent of that header in that it's a mechanism for a
client to request how a server/proxy should handle a request 

Cons:
- that field isn't extensible 
- doesn't really accomplish more than what can be implied by the Supported
header (i.e. if the client wants the information in a response, then if a
server is capable of adding the header, it SHOULD). 

3) Make use of or define something similar to the Session specific policy,
whereby the client "authorizes" a proxy to capture History-Info and that
it's only captured in that case.   

Pros:
- Explicit.

Cons:
- Seems like a lot of overhead, with little advantage. 

4) Follow the approach of existing optional SIP headers added by
intermediaries (e.g. Path and Reason), which is that it's purely a local
policy decision and doesn't require any coordination with the UA as to
whether it should or shouldn't be added. 

Pros: 
- It's fairly straightforward and consistent with the intent of optional
headers.

Cons: 
- Does require some guidelines to ensure that applications that might use
the optional information are robust enough to handle the lack of
information. 

Feedback on these proposals is appreciated and hopefully this discussion
will allow us to reach a final, constructive conclusion.  

Obviously, my preference is the 4th option and perhaps one reason why we've
gotten so stuck on this point is that the guidelines for applications on the
usage of the header are perhaps not obvious.  So, it might be useful to add
an additional section to the document (or perhaps include additional
information for each of the scenarios in the appendix) on application
guidelines around the usage of the information and default behavior if the
information is not available.

Hi Mary,

Yes your last paragraph is the correct interpretation of my email.

I think a  specific privacy tag enables the domain more flexibility with regard to the information shown to the next domain or the user.

E.g. a forwarding entity does not allow the presentation of the URI but the originating do. With a general privacy tag all information will not be forwarded to the UAS, but if you have an explicit tag for the history info only the history info will be not shown and the originating URI will be shown.

Also information that is only needed for domain/local purposes will be hidden but not the information of the originating of the SIP session.

From my understanding a specific privacy tag will help in such kind of use.

Best Regards

Roland

Sebastien and Roland,

I apologize for the delay in responding.  

You are correct in that one privacy aspect currently addressed for
History-Info is around the UA's ability to require privacy for elements of a
message that can somehow divulge information about the end client's
identity. In some ways, History-Info could be considered in the category of
Record Route,  Via, etc.  However, HI is an optional header and per the
recommendation in RFC 3323, the decision was made that if Header privacy was
requested, then History-Info SHOULD not be included.   In addition, if
through local policy or some other local information available wrt the
retargeted URIs, there is knowledge that there should be privacy applied to
these URIs, then as discussed in RFC 3323, the intermediary processing that
request can also add the Privacy header to ensure that History-Info is also
not captured by subsequent intermediaries.  This latter point perhaps is not
so clearly or explicitly spelled out in the current document in the privacy
sections, but there is discussion in the detailed proxy processing behaviour
in 2.3.3 that the local policy can define whether the History-Info captured
would leave a specific domain (this is of course for optionality, as well,
which is another issue that I'll address in a separate email).      

It seems that what's being discussed in these emails is introducing a
specific privacy tag against those entries that local policy defines should
not be forwarded outside a specific domain,  so that they can be removed
(and don't need to be kept persistent by a privacy service).  Right now,
there's an asumption that these entries are somehow known by the proxy, but
perhaps an explicit tag would be useful.  OR are you talking about extending
the current model in RFC 3323 to specifically address the use of a privacy
service for History-Info headers?

I fully support this proposal. 

The privacy regarding the history-info header relates to the privacy policy
accorded to the target of the request (before it is retargeted). Therefore
it shall not depend on the privacy policy accorded to the calling UA. The
history-info header shall have its own privacy value. 
Moreover in case the request is retargeted more than once (particularly if
the targets represent different users), it shall be possible to request
privacy for a target independently of the others.

Dear all,
in 1.3 Ensuring the Privacy of History_Info it is proposed to use a
priv-value of Session or Header level privacy. I would like to propose a own
privacy level for the history info, because the Information shows also
information about the network. With regard to the provider operating a
network some of the providers don't like to transmit information about call
history. Or a redirecting party don't like to show the redirecting address.
Therefore it should be possible to delete the history info at domain
boundaries based on the privacy-value.

I propose the priv-value   =   "history_info"  for the whole History-Info
header.

In addition a option would be useful where only parts (e.g Indes1.1) of the
history info are restricted. That could be done with a privacy statement
within the History-Info .

Yes, NAT does not change the content of SIP messages (Call-ID, 
Via-Header, or SDP content...), since it maps IP/ports at the transport 
level (TCP/UDP...). That's even why it is necessary to use additional  
functions (STUN/TURN and more..) to make SIP work with NAT...

In section 10.3 of RFC 3261, it is written:

"registrar MAY redirect REGISTER requests as appropriate. One common 
usage would be for a registrar listening on a multicast interface to 
redirect multicast REGISTER requests to its own unicast interface with a 
302 (Moved Temporarily) response."

So, I would consider you MAY do it.

Hi:

Let me compare given example with registration renewal. It my clarify
some doubts.

Registration renewal is done for the same Contact URI's, within the same
call leg, using the same Call-ID and incremented CSeq number in the
refresh REGISTER request. This just extends registration time but
doesn't change or add Contact URI. At refresh, Contact(s)'s CSeq number
is updated with a new one, as well as {action, expires, qvalue}
parameters. It is unlikely that Contact parameters are going to be
changed in the renewal requests.

For the same Contact URI in a refresh REGISTER request, if Call-ID is
different, the Contact's Call-ID is updated with a new one, if
expiration time is not zero.

There is no replace of Contact URI's. Only remove (expires=0 for the
Contact) and add.

Is this right?

Thanks,
Dusan.

Hi all,
 If a UAC generates a request in Dialog (say an ACK for 200 it received),
 
 If the 200 had a Record-Route with loose routing and also a Contact 
header where should it route the request ? Can it route it directly to 
the IP/FQDN specified in the uri of Contact ? Does any header take 
precedence over other when generating a subsequent request in a Dialog ?
 Is the significance of Contact header end-to-end or between UAs. For 
the example given in the RFC 3261 (alice and bob), can the intermediate 
proxies modify the value of the Contact header in the response sent by 
Alice to Bob ?

 Thank you,

 Chintan

Assumption is that proxy is in a Record-Route URI domain. Otherwise some
other means can be used to route a request.

Except REGISTER, which must ignore a Record-Route.

Subject: RE: [Sip] Contact header on UPDATE

Jonathan
Since INVITE establishes the target information, it is clear why it is
mandatory on the INVITE.
In subsequent rerquests withina dialog, the Contact need not be
mandatory.
If the remote traget is to be changed, then the Contact must be
specified,
otherwise not. What is broken if UPDATE does not have a Contact? What
functionality is lost?

My understanding for making Contact mandatory on a re-INVITE, was to
avoid
making re-INVITE any different from an INVITE.

It is not a terribly onerous thing to provide Conatct on an UPDATE (and
its
200), but I wish to understand what is achieved by doing it and what is
lost
by not doing it.

[ABN] here you are using UPDATE with an intention of updating your
contact information. I can narrate your scenario as sending an envelope
without addressee contact information. In this case for sure envelope
does not reach the intended destination.=20
Here I meant that you are sending an UPDATE to update your contact
information with the remote party, and UPADTE without contact
information what does it serves for you -- Nothing... hence contact is
mandatory for UPDAET request...

Regards,
Venkat

UPDATE is a target refresh request, which means it updates the remote
target (i.e., the Contact). That means, like INVITE, it needs to contain
a contact.

It's my understanding that Record-Route headers take precedence over the
IP/FQDN in the contact header of the response, as they (Record-Route
headers) are inserted by specifically by the proxies in order to
influence the route that subsequent messaging takes. They influence, not
only the route taken by the ACK, furthermore that taken by any
subsequent requests.

[ABN] once 200 for INVITE is received it forms the Route header for
further requests sent in the same dialog. The logic to form Route header
is been clearly mentioned in the Rfc3261 and the contact information in
200-INVITE forms the Req-URI for subsequent requests.=20

I guess putting FQDN or IP addresses in the Via header driven by the
tradeoff between overhead in DNS query for FQDN name but provides
robustness or direct usage of IP address which lead to undeliverable in
case intermediate entities failure.=20

It's my feeling, please correct me if I am wrong....

Subject: [Sip] RE: [Sip-implementors] Via: processing

Brett, Arlie,

RFC3261 clearly allows a response to be "rerouted" if it can be
determined
that the response did not reach the first-attempt target.  For example,
if
the request is received over TCP, and the connection has gone and cannot
be
reestablished by the time the response is ready to be sent back, RFC3261
states the following

--- from RFC3261, section 18.2.2, 1st bullet.

If that connection attempt fails, the server SHOULD use the procedures
in
[4] for servers in order to determine the IP address and port to open
the
connection and send the response to.

--- end of cut

RFC3263 then gives an algorithm for attempting to determine alternate IP
addresses to which the response might be sent.  Clearly having an FQDN
in
the sent-by will give a chance of success which having an IP address
will
not, especially if the sent-by and received IP addresses are the same!

Not very many support DNS resolution of a
Via entry.  However many support the concept
of adding the Via's received parameter when
it does not match the Via's sent-by address.

Some people have toyed with the idea of
advancing response addresses based upon
rfc3263 during failure situations.

Yes.

Hi
   actually putting IP address in Via is not recommended when the SIP
message has to traverse through NAT. So it is better to have FQDN
instead of IP.=20

I guess putting FQDN or IP addresses in the Via header driven by the
tradeoff between overhead in DNS query for FQDN name but provides
robustness or direct usage of IP address which lead to undeliverable in
case intermediate entities failure.=20

It's my feeling, please correct me if I am wrong....

Subject: [Sip] RE: [Sip-implementors] Via: processing

Brett, Arlie,

RFC3261 clearly allows a response to be "rerouted" if it can be
determined that the response did not reach the first-attempt target.
For example, if the request is received over TCP, and the connection has
gone and cannot be reestablished by the time the response is ready to be
sent back, RFC3261 states the following

--- from RFC3261, section 18.2.2, 1st bullet.

If that connection attempt fails, the server SHOULD use the procedures
in [4] for servers in order to determine the IP address and port to open
the connection and send the response to.

--- end of cut

RFC3263 then gives an algorithm for attempting to determine alternate IP
addresses to which the response might be sent.  Clearly having an FQDN
in the sent-by will give a chance of success which having an IP address
will not, especially if the sent-by and received IP addresses are the
same!

Not very many support DNS resolution of a
Via entry.  However many support the concept
of adding the Via's received parameter when
it does not match the Via's sent-by address.

Some people have toyed with the idea of
advancing response addresses based upon
rfc3263 during failure situations.

Yes.

I was under the impression that the Route header is to be used in order that
UAs can influence the route taken (subsequent to initial INVITE) to include
particular proxy/proxies. To me, that's what 20.34 (of 3261) implies.
 
Are you saying that somewhere in 3261 it states that the Contact info in the
200-INVITE be used to build a "Route:" header for later insertion into, for
example, an ACK request?

It's my understanding that Record-Route headers take precedence over the
IP/FQDN in the contact header of the response, as they (Record-Route
headers) are inserted by specifically by the proxies in order to influence
the route that subsequent messaging takes. They influence, not only the
route taken by the ACK, furthermore that taken by any subsequent requests.

[ABN] once 200 for INVITE is received it forms the Route header for further
requests sent in the same dialog. The logic to form Route header is been
clearly mentioned in the Rfc3261 and the contact information in 200-INVITE
forms the Req-URI for subsequent requests.

Hi all, 
 If a UAC generates a request in Dialog (say an ACK for 200 it received), 
  
 If the 200 had a Record-Route with loose routing and also a Contact 
header where should it route the request ? Can it route it directly to 
the IP/FQDN specified in the uri of Contact ? Does any header take 
precedence over other when generating a subsequent request in a Dialog ? 
 Is the significance of Contact header end-to-end or between UAs. For 
the example given in the RFC 3261 (alice and bob), can the intermediate 
proxies modify the value of the Contact header in the response sent by 
Alice to Bob ? 

 Thank you,

Subject: RE: [Sip] Record-Route and Contact

I was under the impression that the Route header is to be used in order
that UAs can influence the route taken (subsequent to initial INVITE) to
include particular proxy/proxies. To me, that's what 20.34 (of 3261)
implies.

=20

 [ABN] You are right...

=20

Are you saying that somewhere in 3261 it states that the Contact info in
the 200-INVITE be used to build a "Route:" header for later insertion
into, for example, an ACK request?  =20

     =20

[ABN] No... The contact serves the initial Req-URI for subsequent
requests within dialog but then again while the finding next hop's
address Route header (if there is one) takes precedence over Req-Uri.
The top route header might modify the Req-URI if top route header is a
strict router.

It's my understanding that Record-Route headers take precedence over the
IP/FQDN in the contact header of the response, as they (Record-Route
headers) are inserted by specifically by the proxies in order to
influence the route that subsequent messaging takes. They influence, not
only the route taken by the ACK, furthermore that taken by any
subsequent requests.

[ABN] once 200 for INVITE is received it forms the Route header for
further requests sent in the same dialog. The logic to form Route header
is been clearly mentioned in the Rfc3261 and the contact information in
200-INVITE forms the Req-URI for subsequent requests.=20

The Via's sent-by FQDN only needs to be
resolved during failure situations since
the locally added "received" parameter 
would be tried before the sent-by.

Thus providing an FQDN within the Via's
sent-by does not really cause any
overhead beyond the extra "received"
parameter getting added to proxied Via 
entries.

Folks,

Current version of SIP-PUBLISH  as  specified in 
draft-ietf-sip-publish-02.txt leaves out
composer policy as out-of-scope.  Can this lead to interoperability 
issues? If so, I suggest
the draft defines some basic composer policy structure.

Regards,
Alex.

I believe Contact info is used to build a request URI and same set of URI's
in Record-Route are used to build a Route header. If there is no Contact,
the URI's in Record Route are used to build request URI.

Anil

I was under the impression that the Route header is to be used in order that
UAs can influence the route taken (subsequent to initial INVITE) to include
particular proxy/proxies. To me, that's what 20.34 (of 3261) implies.

 

Are you saying that somewhere in 3261 it states that the Contact info in the
200-INVITE be used to build a "Route:" header for later insertion into, for
example, an ACK request?

It's my understanding that Record-Route headers take precedence over the
IP/FQDN in the contact header of the response, as they (Record-Route
headers) are inserted by specifically by the proxies in order to influence
the route that subsequent messaging takes. They influence, not only the
route taken by the ACK, furthermore that taken by any subsequent requests.

[ABN] once 200 for INVITE is received it forms the Route header for further
requests sent in the same dialog. The logic to form Route header is been
clearly mentioned in the Rfc3261 and the contact information in 200-INVITE
forms the Req-URI for subsequent requests.

Subject: [Sip] Record-Route and Contact 

 

Hi all, 
 If a UAC generates a request in Dialog (say an ACK for 200 it received), 
  
 If the 200 had a Record-Route with loose routing and also a Contact 
header where should it route the request ? Can it route it directly to 
the IP/FQDN specified in the uri of Contact ? Does any header take 
precedence over other when generating a subsequent request in a Dialog ? 
 Is the significance of Contact header end-to-end or between UAs. For 
the example given in the RFC 3261 (alice and bob), can the intermediate 
proxies modify the value of the Contact header in the response sent by 
Alice to Bob ? 

 Thank you,

Dear All,

 

In draft-ietf-sip-nat-01.txt, there are SIP extensions for NAT traversal.
The received and rport parameter are used to send back the responses
correctly. However if we don't use these extensions, and change the via ip
address and port with that of firewall/port then the SIP responses will come
directly to firewall, in that case the firewall permits the responses. UA1
inside the network sends requests to firewall/NAT.

 

UA1 

INVITE sip:user@domain.com SIP/2.0 ----------------> Firewall/NAT
----------------------------------------------->UA2

Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 10.1.1.1:4540                          INVITE
sip:user@domain.com SIP/2.0                             

Via: SIP/2.0/UDP firewall_ip:5060

 
(Maintain mapping) 

 

the UA2 will send the responses to firewall/NAT and firewall/NAT will write
back the addresses in Via to original IP/port. I understand from the draft,
if there are no SIP ALG functionality in firewall, then the extensions are
used to make SIP traverse through NAT. However if we implement SIP ALG in
firewall then we can make SIP traverse through NAT. Can anybody tell that
this way is per SIP spec.

 

Thank you,

Anil

You're right in that the current draft leaves composer policy (both 
defining it or setting/changing it) out-of-scope. As to whether it leads 
to interop problems, probably not as far as PUBLISH is concerned.

So any interop problems would be in terms of PIDF and what the PUA is 
expecting the watchers to see when it publishes certain tuples. So this 
is very presence specific.

And for presence, it isn't really clear yet as to how the composer would 
go about resolving conflicts among the tuples coming from different 
sources. By not doing any sort of merging or selection among the tuples 
might work, so the default policy could be that a composer simply passes 
all tuples to watchers intact.

But I don't know how helpful, or indeed what the proper way to state 
this default policy would be. Any suggestions?

Cheers,
Aki

I've started layong out the SIP WG supplemental web site for IETF 59 at 
the usual place:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf59/index.html

This page includes a link for "Agenda Requests", which I shall try to 
keep up-to-date as requests are made.

Remember -- we should use meeting time NOT to introduce new ideas, but 
to discuss issues that we just haven't been able to work out on the 
mailing list. If you have something that you think needs to be talked 
about in the meeting, please send me a request using the html template 
given below. Please include a link to the relevant draft, so that we can 
put together a "reading list".

Here's the template, which I blatantly copied from Gonzalo's note to 
SIPPING:

    <tr>
      <td><a href="mailto:Gonzalo.Camarillo@ericsson.com">
Gonzalo Camarillo</a></td>
      <td>Exploders</td>
      <td><center>5</center></td>
      <td>
<a 
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-camarillo-sipping-exploders-02.txt"> 

draft-camarillo-sipping-exploders-02.txt</a></td>
    </tr>


If the HTML here confuses you, fake it and I'll try and sort it out.

Thanks,

--
Dean

Subject: Changing Via In NAT

 

Dear All,

 

In draft-ietf-sip-nat-01.txt, there are SIP extensions for NAT traversal.
The received and rport parameter are used to send back the responses
correctly. However if we don't use these extensions, and change the via ip
address and port with that of firewall/port then the SIP responses will come
directly to firewall, in that case the firewall permits the responses. UA1
inside the network sends requests to firewall/NAT.

 

UA1 

INVITE sip:user@domain.com SIP/2.0 ----------------> Firewall/NAT
----------------------------------------------->UA2

Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 10.1.1.1:4540                          INVITE
sip:user@domain.com SIP/2.0                             

Via: SIP/2.0/UDP firewall_ip:5060

 
(Maintain mapping) 

 

the UA2 will send the responses to firewall/NAT and firewall/NAT will write
back the addresses in Via to original IP/port. I understand from the draft,
if there are no SIP ALG functionality in firewall, then the extensions are
used to make SIP traverse through NAT. However if we implement SIP ALG in
firewall then we can make SIP traverse through NAT. Can anybody tell that
this way is per SIP spec.

 

Thank you,

Anil

I like this draft, just one little NIT, I think it would be better to call
the tag conf-policy-info instead of just policy-info

Hello Cullen,

Given that this is my first venture into the SIP email forum, and the first
response to your posting, it is only fitting that I should vote for option
c:).

During the coming year or two, I hope to develop an opinion on whether the
issues of backward compatibility and ease of debugging, which seem to make
the binary option rather unpopular in Megaco, apply to SIP as well.  If they
do, it could have an adverse affect on World Hunger, as those with the right
tools to debug binary messages will eat more, at the expense of the rest.

Raphael Tryster

You should apply for a job at a local tabloid - headlining a discussion 
on the encoding of MIME body parts into the mother of all mailing list 
battles on protocol encoding.

Given the first reaction to the draft: this is only about the SIP body. 
Cullen is not proposing that SIP headers be coded in ASN.1 :-)

I'm for option (a), for the reasons you mention. The more interesting 
question is whether all SIP devices still need to be prepared to receive 
all the various encodings.

I thought that binary body was already supported: RFC3261 section 7.4.1, 
third paragraph.

I have submitted an updated version of the History-Info draft.  Until it
becomes available in the respository, you can pick it up at:
http://home.comcast.net/~mary.barnes/IETF/draft-ietf-sip-history-info-02.txt

The primary changes are as follows:
o Merged the SIPPING WG requirements draft into this document. 
   Also, removed redirect server from ISSUER-req since the 
   solution identified this as not being required (or desirable).
  
o Added an explicit privacy requirement (PRIV-req-3) for the 
  proxy's role in recognizing and maintaining privacy associated 
  with a Request-URI being captured in History-Info due to local 
  policy. (Note, that the text was already there, it just wasn't 
  highlighted as an explicit requirement).  

o Removed the compact form for the header since unknown headers 
  with multiple entries would not be recognized.

o Added a summary of Application Considerations to address 
  concerns about the optional usage of History-Info. 

There are 2 open issues identified in the draft:
o Issue 1 is around the privacy issue that has been discussed 
  recently on the list:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg09401.html
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg09371.html

  It has been suggested that adding an additional field to the 
  History-Info header (or extending the priv-values defined in 
  RFC 3323) would facilitate the implementation of a local privacy 
  policy associated with specific Request-URIs. 

o Issue 2 is around whether there needs to be some bounds on the size 
  or number of History-Info entries.  And if so, what's the mechanism
  for defining the bounds (e.g. limit the depth and breadth of the 
  tree by putting upper limits on the Index? )

Eric,

Although Rohan responded to your "Big question:" part of this email:
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg08998.html
it doesn't appear that I ever responded to the remaining points on the list.
Thank you for reviewing the draft and providing detailed comments.   In
updating the draft, I considered your comments as indicated below [MB].

Regards,
Mary.

Subject: [Sip] Comments on history-info


Big question:
Why don't we use multiple History-Info headers, instead of a (potentially
VERY long) single header?

I would argue for multiple headers on two grounds.

First, the idea of a proxy modifying history information doesn't sound
smart.  If it screws up, it is hard to figure out who screwed up.

Second, the index parameter frees us from worrying about header order, which
is a VERY good thing.



Overview:
While the motivation for History-Info is for the initiator of a request to
know what happened to a request, it is also of great use to the recipient
(End of Section 2 overview paragraph).

[MB]: I've clarified this. 

Section 1.2:
How is History-Info any different than Via w.r.t. security?

[MB]: It's quite similar actually, so I've added a statement to that effect
in this section.  I think the only difference being the dependency on the
Index written by the previous hop to generate the index for the current hop.
I do think the general M2M and M2E security solution would also be
applicable to Via if TLS were not deemed to be sufficient (i.e if there were
some reason why you would not want some intermediaries to be able to see the
Via added by an "untrusted" intermediary).  

Nits:
Section 2.5, first paragraph, last sentence:
this would like be a local
this would likely be a local
               ^^
[MB]: Fixed. 

Appendix B, message F8, extra space before last angle-bracket in the
History-Info line.

[MB]: Fixed.

I think what Cullen is proposing is to only send one type of MIME body part =

encoding (i.e., binary) instead of having multiple possible MIME encoding=20
as specified on RFC3261/7.1.4.

I will shortly (finally...) be submitting 
draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-02

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/sip/draft/resource-priority/draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-02.html

Changes are noted below, based on my reading of the January 2004 mailing 
list discussions and the reviews by Paul Kyvizat and Ben Campbell last fall.

(1) Corrected BNF. [Paul, Rohan]

(2) Added namespace registration template and converted initial 
registrations to that template. [multiple]

(3) Now there is a single IANA section with subsections. [Rohan]

(4) Current behavior for DSN, Q.735 specified as non-preemptive. DRSN 
left as implementation-defined. Not sure what other behavior one can 
specify for priorities. [Rohan]

(5) Resource priority for SUBSCRIBE could make sense if a UA has a 
finite capacity for subscriptions and notifications (memory or 
bandwidth). Since NOTIFY establishes no state, only the generic 
request-queueing behavior applies. Text added. [Rohan]

(6) Addressed wording comments (Section 3); was no longer in the draft 
anyway. [Rohan]

(7) Complete request method list. [Rohan] Rather than speculating where 
this might be used, marked as 'o'. [Paul]

(8) Changed 'support' to 'implement' and added some explanatory wording. 
[Rohan]

(9) resource-priority option tag defined in Section 3. [Rohan]

(10) RFC XXXX note added, but not really necessary since the new XML 
version contains &rfc.number; [Rohan]

(11) Removed Appendix A ('Addressing the Requirements') [Ken Karlberg]

(12) Typo and wording corrections [Paul, Ben]

(13) Added distinction to Priority header, but left old text intact. [Paul]

(14) For simplicity, restricted Accept-R-P to UAS; multiple R-P values 
have always been possible. [Paul]

(15) Accept-R-P 420 marked as 'o', with explanation [Paul]. (I'm dubious 
on the reasoning since this means that 'm' cannot appear in any 
extension, thus diminishing the value of the table.)

(16) Multiple namespaces handling made more concrete. [Paul]

(17) Added caveat to OPTIONS handling under overload. [Paul]

(18) OPTIONS handling made MUST. [Ben]

(19) Added discussion on what happens if you modify an R-P value in 
transit. [Ben, others]

Changes discussed, but not made:

- Continues to allow one priority value since the presence of any value 
indicates special treatment, regardless of whether there is another 
value. (In other words, default behavior is a request with no 
Resource-Priority header.)

This may be partially due to confusion in versioning; since the last 
IETF, there were no more 'default' values. (Indeed, the word does not 
appear in the document.) [Mike Pierce]

- 417 generalization to any unknown parameter (since this would not 
allow the user to determine why the request failed) [Alex Audu]

- No mechanism to name all elements in namespace, for simplicity and to 
avoid arguments over which list is referred to by all when a namespace 
gets additional values. [Paul]

Given the stretch of the discussion, it is possible I missed a comment 
or discussion thread. If you respond to this message, please keep each 
item in a separate message as it is very difficult to deal with monster 
messages covering 20 different points.

Henning

Excellent.

Thinking about it a bit more, is there any reason to ALLOW stuffing =
multiple history info info's on a single line?  The idea going back to =
SMTP was that you are only allowed to add history, not change it.  =
Putting multiple history info's in a single history-info header, by =
definition, changes history.

Folks,

I've just submitted an update to the GRUU specification. Until it 
appears in the archives, you can find it at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-01.txt

The differences are:

* removed requirement that the gruu be constructed in such a way that
the contact and/or AOR can be determined from it

* indicate that a gruu can be obtained by the register mechanisms in
the specification, but that other mechanisms are also possible

* The gruu is now associated with the instance ID of the UA. The
instance ID is defined as a callee capability parameter. The
specification now includes a UML diagram showing the relationships
between GRUU, AOR, Contact URI and instance ID.

* Added registration of the sip.instance media feature tag



The biggest change is the third. Indeed, it seems like we have three 
drafts this round that discuss instance identifiers in SIP:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-01.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jennings-sipping-instance-id-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stucker-sip-guid-00.txt

all three are similar. Mine uses a contact header field parameter, and 
uses the callee capabilities framework to enable caller preferences 
routing based on instance iDs. Cullen also uses a contact parameter, but 
not within the callee caps framework. Brian defines a header field. I'll 
post a separate not starting a thread on the pros and cons of the 
various approaches.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Folks,

We have three drafts this round that all propose a way to define an 
instance identifier for a UA:


http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-01.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jennings-sipping-instance-id-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stucker-sip-guid-00.txt

all three are similar. Mine uses a contact header field parameter, and 
uses the callee capabilities framework to enable caller preferences 
routing based on instance iDs. Cullen also uses a contact parameter, but 
not within the callee caps framework. Brian defines a header field.

I think we generally understand the requirement here, though it would 
probably be good to obtain use cases to be sure. The design choice is 
where to include this parameter, and this represents the difference 
between the three approaches.

I tend to prefer a Contact URI parameter over a header. My main reason 
for that is REGISTER requests. If a register request has multiple 
contacts, which contact does the instance identifier apply to? As a 
header field, it would be hard to know. If you make it a contact header 
field parameter, its no problem. Those header field parameters could 
also then be used in the Contact in INVITE/200 SUB/NOT, etc.

Then, the question is whether to use a regular Contact header field 
parameter as Cullen has done, or a callee cap parameter as I have done? 
The callee cap approach allows for caller preferences to be applied to 
routing to a specific instance. Now, a good question is whether such a 
thing is needed or even a good idea, if we have GRUU as the ideal way to 
route to a UA instance. I can go either way, but welcome thoughts on the 
topic.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

I don't know what the confusion is. Looking at the -01 version contained on 
the IETF-58 CD I just received, there is the following statement in Section 12:

"The registration MUST indicate the default level to be assumed in the 
absence of the priority value ..."

Was there another unumbered update that I missed?

There was an early -02 that I only announced to the mailing list, but 
never got around to submitting. In any event, the notion of defaults is 
gone since it makes no sense in the current setup.

No, this draft will not address ISUP interworking.  The draft provides some
example applications in order to highlight how the History-Info header could
be used, but there's nothing normative about any of those examples.   John
Elwell had put out a draft on how to do diversion for QSIG interworking,
which does make use of History-Info that you might find useful (note the
draft itself has expired and I'll let John address how or whether he plans
to progress that; my understanding is that this work is being done in ECMA).
So, I would think the functionality you're describing might be something the
ITU or another SDO would want to define.  

Regards,
Mary.

Subject: [Sip] Updated History-Info draft submitted


I have submitted an updated version of the History-Info draft.  Until it
becomes available in the respository, you can pick it up at:
http://home.comcast.net/~mary.barnes/IETF/draft-ietf-sip-history-info-02.txt

The primary changes are as follows: 
o Merged the SIPPING WG requirements draft into this document. 
   Also, removed redirect server from ISSUER-req since the 
   solution identified this as not being required (or desirable). 
  
o Added an explicit privacy requirement (PRIV-req-3) for the 
  proxy's role in recognizing and maintaining privacy associated 
  with a Request-URI being captured in History-Info due to local 
  policy. (Note, that the text was already there, it just wasn't 
  highlighted as an explicit requirement).  
o Removed the compact form for the header since unknown headers 
  with multiple entries would not be recognized. 
o Added a summary of Application Considerations to address 
  concerns about the optional usage of History-Info. 
There are 2 open issues identified in the draft: 
o Issue 1 is around the privacy issue that has been discussed 
  recently on the list: 
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg09401.html 
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg09371.html 
  It has been suggested that adding an additional field to the 
  History-Info header (or extending the priv-values defined in 
  RFC 3323) would facilitate the implementation of a local privacy 
  policy associated with specific Request-URIs. 
o Issue 2 is around whether there needs to be some bounds on the size 
  or number of History-Info entries.  And if so, what's the mechanism 
  for defining the bounds (e.g. limit the depth and breadth of the 
  tree by putting upper limits on the Index? )

Eric,

History-Info is a  bit different than the SMTP (at least as best as I
understand SMTP not being an expert in that area), since the retargeting in
SIP is more complicated that SMTP due to forking, etc.  In order to be able
to accurately reflecting the forking, we've added the index.  The index is
used to generate subsequent History-Info entries.  In addition, there's the
Reason that gets added to the targeted-to URIs to reflect the reason for the
retargeting. So, yes History-Info does change History in the sense that we
embellish the Request-URIs that are "visited" with additional information
that seems to be useful to a variety of end applications.  So, I think what
you're proposing would only provide a subset of the functionality that we're
after.

Mary.

Excellent.

Thinking about it a bit more, is there any reason to ALLOW stuffing multiple
history info info's on a single line?  The idea going back to SMTP was that
you are only allowed to add history, not change it.  Putting multiple
history info's in a single history-info header, by definition, changes
history.

Johnathan,

I'm not opposed to the client ID being transported in the registration
contact,
but seeing as there were two drafts that already discuss that, I didn't see
much point in rehashing it again in my draft. =)

I believe there are some important points that you're leaving out. 

Besides being client generated (which reduces the requirements for
generating
the ID) there are advantages to NOT mandating that the ID be expressed only 
as a parameter in the contact of a registration. 

The idea behind the GUID (and hence the lack of a specific usecase in the
-00 version of the document) is that it can be used for other activities. 
I'm not opposed to communicating the ID in a contact parameter as well as
a regular header, I just don't view transporting it in a contact header
as being always necessary or desirable depending on what you want to do
with it.

Sending it as a header allows for some interesting behavior to occur on 
non-registration requests:

- Can be used to eliminate duplicate subscriptions due to client's state
being wiped out (ie. ignore the callid/tags of an existing subscription
if the client ID matches the client ID of that subscription [and the other
information about the subscription is the same]).
- Can be used to identify the client sending a request across networks
where no other identifier is easily obtainable (NATs and the such), or 
BBUAs are present in the network.
- Can be used to identify the source of state information being pushed
into the network (presence update, etc). This is one area where conveying
the information in a contact seems a little cumbersome. The request may 
not be sent to the registrar, and a contact may otherwise be completely 
unnecessary.

In the cases where registration behavior is controlled, it requires a change
to the registrar in order to capture the appropriate behavior that should be
taken wrt a client ID. Therefore, including the information as a header or
in the contact seems moot to me as either mechanism can easily be made to 
work. Perhaps there's a usecase I'm not considering?

Additionally, I believe that there needs to be some convergence on the
approach
taken by generating the identifier itself. The mechanism that is suggested 
in your draft seems to rely upon a server to generate the unique identifier,

whereas in the other two drafts, it is the client that generates the 
unique identifier. I believe there are advantages to each.

Subject: [Sip] SIP instance identifiers


Folks,

We have three drafts this round that all propose a way to define an 
instance identifier for a UA:


http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-01.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jennings-sipping-instance-id-00.tx
t
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stucker-sip-guid-00.txt

all three are similar. Mine uses a contact header field parameter, and 
uses the callee capabilities framework to enable caller preferences 
routing based on instance iDs. Cullen also uses a contact parameter, but 
not within the callee caps framework. Brian defines a header field.

I think we generally understand the requirement here, though it would 
probably be good to obtain use cases to be sure. The design choice is 
where to include this parameter, and this represents the difference 
between the three approaches.

I tend to prefer a Contact URI parameter over a header. My main reason 
for that is REGISTER requests. If a register request has multiple 
contacts, which contact does the instance identifier apply to? As a 
header field, it would be hard to know. If you make it a contact header 
field parameter, its no problem. Those header field parameters could 
also then be used in the Contact in INVITE/200 SUB/NOT, etc.

Then, the question is whether to use a regular Contact header field 
parameter as Cullen has done, or a callee cap parameter as I have done? 
The callee cap approach allows for caller preferences to be applied to 
routing to a specific instance. Now, a good question is whether such a 
thing is needed or even a good idea, if we have GRUU as the ideal way to 
route to a UA instance. I can go either way, but welcome thoughts on the 
topic.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I believe there are some important points that you're leaving out. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Besides being client generated (which reduces the requirements for generating</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>the ID) there are advantages to NOT mandating that the ID be expressed only </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>as a parameter in the contact of a registration. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The idea behind the GUID (and hence the lack of a specific usecase in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>-00 version of the document) is that it can be used for other activities. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>I'm not opposed to communicating the ID in a contact parameter as well as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>a regular header, I just don't view transporting it in a contact header</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>as being always necessary or desirable depending on what you want to do</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>with it.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Sending it as a header allows for some interesting behavior to occur on </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>non-registration requests:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>- Can be used to eliminate duplicate subscriptions due to client's state</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>being wiped out (ie. ignore the callid/tags of an existing subscription</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>if the client ID matches the client ID of that subscription [and the other</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>information about the subscription is the same]).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>- Can be used to identify the client sending a request across networks</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>where no other identifier is easily obtainable (NATs and the such), or </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>BBUAs are present in the network.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>- Can be used to identify the source of state information being pushed</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>into the network (presence update, etc). This is one area where conveying</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>the information in a contact seems a little cumbersome. The request may </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>not be sent to the registrar, and a contact may otherwise be completely </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>unnecessary.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In the cases where registration behavior is controlled, it requires a change</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>to the registrar in order to capture the appropriate behavior that should be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>taken wrt a client ID. Therefore, including the information as a header or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>in the contact seems moot to me as either mechanism can easily be made to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>work. Perhaps there's a usecase I'm not considering?</FONT>

It is unclear what this note means, since Section 9.5 does not reflect what 
it says. The -02 draft (Section 9.5) shows "Preemption with rejection" for dsn 
and drsn and "Precedence" for q735. All three of these cases are services 
which are titled "Precedence and Preemption". In fact, q735 (and I.255.3 on which 
it is based) is the same as dsn/drsn, so there should be no difference.

It continues to be unclear what this item ("Preemption or precedence") on the 
template is intended to mean. There is no IANA function related to this type 
of information, and the contents of this part of the template have no effect 
on the operation of any device which uses the R-P header. They will do whatever 
they need to with it depending on the application. For the dsn application, 
this includes "preemption", "precedence", and probably other treatments that 
aren't included in either of those terms.  In fact, this item seems to be 
defined differently in Section 9.4 which says "there are many possible behaviors 
that cannot be exhaustively anticipated" and lists 3 "common" ones.

I would still like to see this item deleted from the template, since it can 
only lead to confusion.

If it not deleted, the item on the template should be titled "Behavior" (as 
in 9.4) and all three namespaces included in the document should indicate 
"Implementation-defined".

The change note pre-dated my last-minute updates; pardon the rush.

My general notion is that IANA registrations should be as useful as 
possible to the implementor, not just bare-bones information needed to 
preserve uniqueness.

Changing to 'Behavior' is fine by me, with implementation-defined 
clearly being a viable option, as there are likely to be priority 
namespaces that simply don't spell out exactly what you're supposed to 
do, as long as priority X gets better treatment than Y, if prio(X) > 
prio(Y).

That would be a clear improvement, I think.

> 3. Rendering to user

It's not clear to me what it is you're objecting to in this section,
except perhaps that the user interface guideline is poorly rendered.

The real requirement, I think, is that if the user is being asked for
credentials, they should be shown the realm value at that time; a fact
that is made clear in RFC 2617 (sec 3.2.1):

  realm
    A string to be displayed to users so they know which username and
    password to use.

This case couldn't come up in HTTP, since proxy authentication in HTTP
is hop-by-hop, and 407 challenges are never passed back to the user
agent by a proxy.  However, the reset of the description of realm is
good advice:

                ... This string should contain at least the name of
   the host performing the authentication and might additionally
   indicate the collection of users who might have access. An example
   might be "registered_users@gotham.news.com".

Agreed - the To header value is not protected by the hash, so
associating it is not appropriate.  In addition, this paragraph
encourages the existing confusion between these two values
(admittedly, they are often the same, but it is the Request URI that
is used in authentication).

As a practical matter, if you have the same username and password in
both domains it doesn't matter - if you don't, then it's an impossibly
clumsy situation (this problem is part of the reason that we defined
proxy authentication to by hop-by-hop in HTTP in the first place).

Essentially, I think that putting two proxies in a row with the same
realm is a difficult configuration to diagnose.  If administrators do
this, they are asking for trouble.  But there is another approach I
don't think you examined.

If the proxy is using the 2617 version of Digest (with the qop
attribute) as opposed to the 1867 version, then the UA can tell
the difference.  The message flow looks like this:

        UA                    P1                  P2
    a    +------REQ 1--------->|                   |
    b    |<----407(1)----------+                   |
    c    +------REQ 2 -------->+----REQ 2--------->|
    e    |<---407(2)-----------+<-----407(2)-------|
         +------REQ 3--------->+----REQ 3--------->|

 a) initial request
 b) challenge from P1, with the qop parameter specified
 c) retried request, with a qop parameter, and therefor also a cnonce
    chosen by the UA; it is passed on (now without authentication) to P2
 d) P2 challenges, also specifying a qop parameter
    P2 challenge is forwarded by P1, with the WWW-Authenticate
    header as provided by P2, but also with an Authentication-Info
    provided by P1.

The UA can recognize that authentication to P1 was successful, because
P1 returned an Authentication-Info header that contained the cnonce
and nc values from message c (REQ 2), and a correct response hash to
show that P1 knows the authentication secret.

As I noted earlier, 2617 allows only one because proxy authentication
is hop-by-hop, but the cnonce value allows the UA to disambiguate them
(if they are carefully constructed, but then they should be anyway).

All this is even more reason to use qop (which was the intent of 2617
in the first place).

Okay, guess I missed that change. Deleting registration of the default makes 
sense anyway. It would be part of the procedural details for a specific use of 
the R-P header instead.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State
                              Publication
	Author(s)	: A. Niemi
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-publish-03.txt
	Pages		: 40
	Date		: 2004-2-16
	
This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) for publishing event state used within the framework
for SIP Event Notification. The first application of this extension
is targeted at the publication of presence information.
The mechanism described in this document can be extended to support
publication of any event state, for which there exists an appropriate
event package. It is not intended to be a general-purpose mechanism
for transport of arbitrary data, as there are better-suited
mechanisms for this purpose (FTP, HTTP, etc.)

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-publish-03.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-publish-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I think the key thing we need to do first is figure out what it is we 
want to do with it (i.e., requirements!). I am principally interested in 
its usage with GRUU. In that usage, it is necessary to be carried in the 
contact header.

I'm not sure this is good behavior though. Its perfectly fine to have 
two subscriptions to the same thing from the same UA instance. If the 
state is wiped out and the client sends a second subscription, the first 
will either time out, or if the server sends a NOTIFY, the NOTIFY will 
time out or generatea a 481, both of which terminate the first 
subscription. This behavior seems fine.

OK, but whats the use case?

OK, this is a fair point. There does appear to be a need in PUBLISH 
(more in pidf I think) for having a unique identifier of the source of 
the publication.

If you put it in a header, you would need to include additional 
parameters to correlate it to the specific Contact in a registration 
that it applies to. This can work, but its messy and unnecessary if you 
include the guid in the contact directly.

No, the instance ID is generated by the client. I just don't say how. I 
think there are specs that give guidance on generating unique IDs. I 
couldnt find an rfc reference, maybe it was somewhere else, but this is 
well-trod territory. I dont think our requirements for unique 
identifiers are different than anyone elses.

I think the client has to generate it always.

I think one could provide links to other policy documents, but this is 
best done via other purpose tags. "policy" is pretty general, and I 
think  you want to be as specific as possible here.

I'm open to a number of requirements, but simply constraining the set of
things we ought to try to tackle simple to what's in GRUU seems to miss
the opportunity to kill multiple birds with one stone. I'd like to see
a solution that encapsulates as many usecases as possible, and I'm not
adverse to the idea of carrying the ID in the contact header itself. I
just don't think that's the ONLY place it makes sense to send it.

Sometimes it's OK, sometimes it's not. Let's give ourselves the option
to choose when we want this type of behavior (which I would think would
generally be rare considering we'd be sending an extra NOTIFY and holding
onto a subscription for no apparent reason). Using an ID to uniquely 
identify the client can help to reduce unwanted traffic. Is it the only
way it can be done? No. But it is a handy way to do it if we're not
adverse to including this type of information in requests.

Can be used to correlate requests from the same client where IP
addresses may not be available at all nodes, and the context-matching
information may have been jumbled by a BBUA. Can use useful for matching
up calls to other non-call transactions, etc.

This is a good point. In that case it makes sense to put it into the
contacts for the registration, but once again, I'm not trying to exclude
this option in my draft. It was already discussed elsewhere, so there seemed
no need to go back over it.

True enough. I just wanted to put in some ground-rules so we avoid some
of the troubles that you find in poor implementations of callid/tag
generators
for the SIP stack. Sometimes it's helpful to put a baseline out there so
people
are at a minimum cognizant of what they're getting themselves into that may
not otherwise be obvious to the implementor.

Sometimes it makes sense for the server to generate it, especially if the 
server is a trusted third-party and the ID is used for some sort of
non-repudiation
tactic.

I'm not changing any of the functionality.  As Rohan says, it is already =
in the spec.  I'm suggesting we do not allow a proxy to *modify* an =
existing history-info header.  A proxy can (and should) *insert* new =
history-info headers.  It is because we have the index tag that the =
modification restriction should not be a problem.

Hi,

In draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-01.txt, it looks like there is a 
printing mistake in the grammar defined for Resource-Priority header . Its 
given as 
       Resource-Priority  =  "Resource-Priority" HCOLON
                              (*COMMA Resource-value)
 
But I guess, no header can start with a COMMA . It should actually be 
       Resource-Priority  =  "Resource-Priority" HCOLON
                              Resource-value(*COMMA Resource-value)

This is the way the grammar is given for Accept-Resource-Priority. 
Can anyone confirm on this pls? 

thanks in advance...

Cullen,

This is an attractive proposal because it has potential to make sip 
implementations simpler. But before I can answer I need clarification on 
one thing:

Does this apply to content referenced and fetched via content-indirection?

This proposal only has value if my mime processor *never* needs to deal 
with any content-transfer-encoding other than binary. If content 
referenced by content indirection still might use other encodings, then 
that value is lost. Unfortunately, given the potential range of 
transports that might be used with content indirection, I don't know if 
requiring binary can be done in general.

Yes, this is the point I was trying to make. The fact that a username =
and password for a realm is preconfigured does not mean that the user =
does not get to re-enter those credentials if the server rejected the =
ones sent earlier.

I don't think this takes into consideration pre-configuration.

In SIP, unfortunately it is possible.

Can we mandate that for SIP??

Perhaps I was not clear in my text. Imagine this scenario: I have cached =
my credentials for an outbound proxy with realm proxy.nokia.com from an =
earlier transaction. Now I send a new INVITE routed through the outbound =
proxy that gets a 407 from a second proxy with the same realm. How do I =
know if the 407 came from the outbound proxy (the username password =
might have changed in the meantime) or from the next hop proxy?

This is not mandated for SIP entities, maybe it aught to be.

SIP BNF allows multiples of those headers. Is this a BNF bug? If not, =
then some Authentication-Info parameters need to be mandated.

I can imagine cases where we might want to be able to route by the instance
ID. I think the +sip.instance approach is a better than the general contact
header I proposed. It provides more options for routing and has no
disadvantages.

Based on the discussion of "routing" based on instance identifiers, I 
think we may be getting involved in triggerwork that may become more 
complex than is actually required, because we're all reasoning from 
secondary positions. So I'd like to take a step back and consider how we 
got here, and what we think we're trying to accomplish.

I see four high-level cases around request routing that illustrate 
different aspects of this discussion.

1) General case: We wish to address a request to an AOR, such that any 
contact at that AOR might respond. This is basic 2543-type routing behavior.

2) Capability case: We wish to address a request to an AOR, such that 
any contact capable of satisfying the request in a way that we like 
might respond. This behavior is brought out in callee-caps and 
caller-preferences and the accept/supported/required syntax of 3261.

3) Followups to a specific instance: We have previously done something 
(such as case 1 or 2) such that the operation of interest has resolved 
to a specific contact instance associated with an AoR, and we wish 
subsequent operations (for example, a transfer) to reach that same 
specific contact instance, even if that specific contact instance is 
hidden behind an indirection layer (firewall, anonymizer, etc.). As I 
understand it, this is the heart of the GRUU concept.

4) Selection of a specific instance in an initial request: We have a 
request that we wish to reach one specific instance of a contact 
associated with an AoR. It has been proposed that we accomplish this by 
binding some sort of instance tag to the AoR. It has been proposed that 
we use some sort of URI convention (like the msuri), +based 
subaddressing, or that we use a header convention for binding the 
instance tag to the AoR. To my knowledge, we haven't really described 
the requirement or use case for reaching a specific instance on an 
initial request, but I can think of several offhand (including diagnostics).

It seems evident that there is a huge overlap between the requirements 
of 3 and 4. Indeed, I think #3 (GRUU) came out of early ideas I had on 
using a REGISTER-response extension to assign an instance-AoR to a 
Contact. It would appear that IF each contact for an AoR were to have an 
associated GRUU, and that knowledge of those GRUU assigments were 
available to a requestor, that the requester could use the 
target-specific GRUU to achieve the use cases I currently imagine for #4.


What am I missing here?

Henning,

(Splitting comments by subject.) There are still problems with the ABNF, 
around the usage of "*" to indicate repetition. As it stands, it accepts:

     Resource-Priority: f.1,,,-.-
     Resource-Priority: 9.a f.-

but it doesn't accept:

     Resource-Priority: foo.bar, foo-1.bar-1, foo-1.bar-2

Assuming the intent is to permit more than two values, separation of
values by exactly one comma, and namespaces and priorities that can
include multiple dashes and alphanums, then I think the following is 
what you want:

     Resource-Priority  = "Resource-Priority" HCOLON
                          Resource-value *(COMMA Resource-value)
...
     namespace          = *(alphanum / "-")
     r-priority         = *(alphanum / "-")

ABNF for Accept-Resource-Priority is similarly flawed. It should be:

     Accept-Resource-Priority = "Accept-Resource-Priority" HCOLON
                                [Resource-value *(COMMA Resource-value)]

Henning,

OPTIONS handling: there is good explanation of options processing in a
UAS, but it is very UAS specific. There isn't any discussion of options
processing in proxies that support this extension. It is possible to get
a proxy to respond to an options request (using Max-Forwards). This
might be used in testing, just a strict mode might.

I think what a proxy should return is pretty much the same as what a UAS 
returns.

	Paul

I think that your list is missing the opportunity to define this instance 
ID in such a way that it can be used to identify a particular endpoint 
for other operations beyond simply routing. The reuse potential seems 
very good if we don't lock the instance identifier down to simply
routing operations, and instead open it up for other general-purpose
operations.

That is at the heart of my draft. Don't limit yourself to one application
when with a small amount of work we can use this to solve other problems
both current and future. Likewise, don't exclude routing operations from
making use of the instance identifier either.

Are you concerned that opening this up to having the instance identifier
transported (in addition to the registered contact) outside of the 
registered contact is really going to be that complex? 

Regards,

Brian

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Based on the discussion of &quot;routing&quot; based on instance identifiers, I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; think we may be getting involved in triggerwork that may become more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; complex than is actually required, because we're all reasoning from </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; secondary positions. So I'd like to take a step back and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; consider how we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; got here, and what we think we're trying to accomplish.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I see four high-level cases around request routing that illustrate </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; different aspects of this discussion.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; 1) General case: We wish to address a request to an AOR, such </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; that any </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; contact at that AOR might respond. This is basic 2543-type </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; routing behavior.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; 2) Capability case: We wish to address a request to an AOR, such that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; any contact capable of satisfying the request in a way that we like </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; might respond. This behavior is brought out in callee-caps and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; caller-preferences and the accept/supported/required syntax of 3261.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; 3) Followups to a specific instance: We have previously done </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; something </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; (such as case 1 or 2) such that the operation of interest has </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; resolved </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; to a specific contact instance associated with an AoR, and we wish </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; subsequent operations (for example, a transfer) to reach that same </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; specific contact instance, even if that specific contact instance is </FONT>

So you see a requirement to uniquely identify a specific SIP endpoint 
OUTSIDE of the domain of SIP routing, such that this identification can 
support further applications?

Use cases here might include:

1) billing -- "Alice called Bob from phone ID000001 through gateway 
ID3344555 on Tuesday, March 1, 2011"

2) Debugging -- "This request was responded to by node IDYIYIOHIHIUH, 
which is a Barfia model 9995 phone running Finux 21.05A and the Vocal 
user agent release 89.6"

This begs the question of identity namespace.

No, I'm concerned that solving the general 
device-identity-representation problem, including such aspects as 
nonrepudiability, may be outside the scope of SIP/SIPPING. At what point 
does this become HIP (Host Identity Payload)?

One way to bound this to a manageable scope is to consider the 
"identity" being represented as simply informational and 
not-to-be-relied upon, except to the extent supported by basic SIP 
security constructs. Like "To:" and "From:" . . .

Another approach is to limit the expression of identity herein to that 
subset of identify which is expressly describable using SIP, which makes 
it analogous to the SIP routing mechanisms underlying the concepts of 
AoR, asserted identity, and verified/vouchsafed identity in the various 
documents that touch on those concepts. In other words, we restrict 
ourselves to the namspace of SIP AoRs.

Jonathan,

I like using a callee-cap feature tag in a registration. OTOH, I can see 
validity in Brian's desire to have it in a header of its own, 
potentially in any message. I don't see those usages as conflicting.

The only potential conflict would be in REGISTER, but that isn't a real 
conflict - a Guid header would describe the entity sending the REGISTER 
message, while the +sip.instance tag on a contact would describe the 
endpoint being registered. Often they would be the same, but not 
necessarily.

Regarding the form of guids, I don't think any single scheme works in 
all cases. My preference is to:

- represent the instance id as a URI

- make it the responsibility of the endpoint to select a URI
   that is unique

- Recommend that a URN be used.

- Define a couple of new URN namespaces that are especially
   suitable for this purpose. (I have in mind urn:mac:xxx for
   mac addresses, and possibly urn:random:xxx for random numbers
   in some large range.)

A couple of other comments:

Section 7.1 says:

    The combination of a UA instance ID and an AOR is referred to as an
    instance ID/AOR pair. There is a one-to-one mapping between such a
    pair and a GRUU; ...

And figure 2 shows the corresponding 1:1 relationship. But it isn't 
necessarily 1:1. It should be 1:0..1 because it is possible to have an 
instance ID/AOR Pair that doesn't have a GRUU. (Instance IDs are 
valuable in their own right.)

This 1:0..1 relationship imposes another error condition on registrars. 
If an attempt is made to register a contact with an instance id in use 
by some other contact of the same AOR, the registrar will have to refuse 
it. This needs to be spelled out somewhere, and a suitable error 
identified. (I don't know if any of the existing responses works for 
this. At the least, a new Reason code is likely to be needed.)

I agree in general, but the details are a bit tricky. If I address an 
OPTIONS request to pkyzivat@cisco.com, should the cisco.com proxy 
respond with its Accept-R-P version or should it let it go through and 
have your end system speak for itself? The two lists may obviously not 
be the same.

Yup, minus the responses for ACK.

I thought this was clear in the definition of OPTIONS. If Max-Forwards 
is zero when it gets to the proxy, then the proxy is supposed to 
generate its own response to the OPTIONS. Otherwise it is supposed to 
proxy the request on.

No, but it represents additional work.

This is a well trod area, and I think it would behoove us to look at 
work in other groups. Dean has mentioned HIP as one obvious candidate; 
generally speaking this exact issue - of endpoint identifiers that work 
better than IP address, is the subject of much other work at this 
moment, including MAST. I'm not familiar enough with it to know if its 
relevant... its on my reading list for this ietf.

OK, I'll update the diagram.

Well, thats one option.

This needs to be spelled out somewhere, and a suitable error

Here is the use case for this. The use case is when a UA crashes, 
recovers, obtains a new IP, and re-registers. In this case, several 
things could possibly happen:

1. The registrar accepts the second registration, as per normal 
registration procedures. An INVITE to the gruu bound to that id/aor pair 
gets translated into BOTH contacts, causing the request to fork. There 
is never any response from the old IP. Within one refresh interval, the 
old contact is removed and all is well.

2. The registrar accepts the second registration, and automatically 
deletes the old one. I believe Brian proposed this behavior.

3. The registrar returns an error. The client fetches the current list 
of contacts, finds the old one listed, and unregisters it.



Approach 1 is problematic, as it will introduce herfp; any non-2xx from 
the new contact will wait for the 2nd branch to timeout. Its not clear 
to me whether 2 or 3 is more right. It depends a lot on who owns the 
policy for how to resolve the conflict - is it the server or the client?

Well, I prefer 3261-style, but yes.

Right.

Yes.

My proposal of using a callee capabilities parameter for instance ID
would accomplish that. However, I am not sure that its really useful, to
be honest. How would the caller know the instance ID ahead of time? Any
kind of mechanism that can transfer the instance ID could transfer the
GRUU instead, and a GRUU will be much, much, much better.

I wasnt proposing that. The +sip.instance is the convention used by
callee caps for identifying Contact header parameters that are subject
to the specification.

Yes.

Right, this is exactly what I am saying above as well.

I do not understand the need for a globally unique instance ID to
support billing, and would be very scared of fraud issues.

I'm not sure I understand the specific value gleaned from the instance
ID in this case.

A very small amount of additional work, and I believe the majority of it
has already been handled in my draft (specifically defining the header). 
We've agreed that there's a need for a mechanism like this
for PUBLISH. There's an obvious hole in generating meaningful instance 
identifiers for PIDF documents and the such. Other state aggregation
mechanisms
in the future are easily envisionable that would need to know which unique 
client sent a request, where it would be useful to have that information
transported in a request in a handy mechanism.

Why not take care of both problems in one shot, define the (minimal)
interactions
and then follow things up in the various drafts like PUBLISH and any others
that
see a need for this where they define the appropriate policy for using the
instance identifier they've been given ala RFC-3265. Define the basic
mechanism
(in that case SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY) and let others define the usages.

Agreed. The two mechanisms can easily live together much like an 
expires header in the registration does along side one in the contact.

This represents additional work as well. =)

I think we're limiting ourselves to just MACs and random numbers. Having
looked around a bit, I've seen material (I want to say it's from WebDAV
but I could be remembering incorrectly) that the MAC address isn't always
a good thing to pass around because you can figure out that the UA is 
running on a particular piece of hardware without otherwise having access
to their MAC (because you're on the other side of the world many routers
away). That can be used to determine a method of attack because you can 
inferr what operating systems, etc might be running if you know what kind
of hardware that box is plugged into the network with.

That said, if you want to use a MAC, fine. Buyer beware. If you want to use
a random number, fine. If you want to use the GPS coordinates of the box to
some ridiculous level of precision (and that's good enough for your
application)
fine. 

I don't see why we necessarily need to put any restrictions on this
instance ID to make it a URN or anything else when it really need not be any
more complex than a VIA branch. I also don't see a reason why we should
expect
other nodes in the network to be able to use the instance identifier for
anything
other than a token (ie. if it's a mac address, and two UA instances do
something
because it's a MAC address, that's OK, but other's may not take that tact).
There's
no guarantee others are going to be able to take whatever action might be
denoted
by the contents of the instance identifier itself, so it becomes entirely 
proprietary at that point.

This is why I put some boundaries on the length of the GUID and some
basic guidelines, to make this very unlikely to occur for reasonably 
well behaved implementations.

Agree on 1 being bad.

IMHO it's the server that owns the policy. If the client is too dumb to 
remember their previous contact address, then it's probably too stateless
to make policy decisions about which contact should be removed too
(otherwise
it would have simply deregistered that contact in the first place).

</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I don't see why we necessarily need to put any restrictions on this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>instance ID to make it a URN or anything else when it really need not be any</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>more complex than a VIA branch. I also don't see a reason why we should expect</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>other nodes in the network to be able to use the instance identifier for anything</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>other than a token (ie. if it's a mac address, and two UA instances do something</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>because it's a MAC address, that's OK, but other's may not take that tact). There's</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>no guarantee others are going to be able to take whatever action might be denoted</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>by the contents of the instance identifier itself, so it becomes entirely </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; A couple of other comments:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; Section 7.1 says:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The combination of a UA instance ID and an AOR is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; referred to as an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instance ID/AOR pair. There is a one-to-one mapping </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; between such a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pair and a GRUU; ...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; And figure 2 shows the corresponding 1:1 relationship. But it isn't </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; necessarily 1:1. It should be 1:0..1 because it is possible </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; to have an </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; instance ID/AOR Pair that doesn't have a GRUU. (Instance IDs are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; valuable in their own right.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; OK, I'll update the diagram.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; This 1:0..1 relationship imposes another error condition on </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; registrars. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; If an attempt is made to register a contact with an </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; instance id in use </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; by some other contact of the same AOR, the registrar will </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; have to refuse </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; it. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Well, thats one option.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>This is why I put some boundaries on the length of the GUID and some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>basic guidelines, to make this very unlikely to occur for reasonably </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>well behaved implementations.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; This needs to be spelled out somewhere, and a suitable error</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; identified. (I don't know if any of the existing responses </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; works for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; this. At the least, a new Reason code is likely to be needed.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Here is the use case for this. The use case is when a UA crashes, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; recovers, obtains a new IP, and re-registers. In this case, several </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; things could possibly happen:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; 1. The registrar accepts the second registration, as per normal </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; registration procedures. An INVITE to the gruu bound to that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; id/aor pair </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; gets translated into BOTH contacts, causing the request to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; fork. There </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; is never any response from the old IP. Within one refresh </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; interval, the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; old contact is removed and all is well.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; 2. The registrar accepts the second registration, and automatically </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; deletes the old one. I believe Brian proposed this behavior.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; 3. The registrar returns an error. The client fetches the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; current list </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; of contacts, finds the old one listed, and unregisters it.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Approach 1 is problematic, as it will introduce herfp; any </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; non-2xx from </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the new contact will wait for the 2nd branch to timeout. Its </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; not clear </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; to me whether 2 or 3 is more right. It depends a lot on who owns the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; policy for how to resolve the conflict - is it the server or </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the client?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Agree on 1 being bad.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>IMHO it's the server that owns the policy. If the client is too dumb to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>remember their previous contact address, then it's probably too stateless</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>to make policy decisions about which contact should be removed too (otherwise</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>it would have simply deregistered that contact in the first place).</FONT>

If the particular network implementation only hands out the ID to trusted
nodes, this is no less safe than our current authentication mechanisms IMHO.
I don't forsee using the ID as a "bill to" number, but it could be used to
help correlate billing records as a call goes through the system, in which 
case it does not matter what that value is, just that it's consistient from
hop to hop.

If you're scared of fraud issues, think about what happens when you send an
INVITE into a system with a Referred-By of some unsuspecting third-party
user
of that system. =) Much worse problem that exists today. You probably won't 
get a free call, but you might make some interesting international calls
before anyone figures out what's going on.

It survives BBUAs for one. Probably not the best use case, but may be
interesting for future thought. System admins will probably love to have
a consistient identifier throughout the system identifying what a 
particular endpoint did throughout a request or requests.

The specific use cases I had in mind were to recover from client crashes
where it's undesirable, and network policy to limit resource usage. For 
instance, duplicate subscriptions to the same resource for the same
event package from the same client instance. Sure, sometimes it might 
make sense (can't think of one, but let's assume that there is a case). 
That still represents network resources (ie. resources associated with
storing that subscription and handling it on state changes for that
event) and the network might not want to allow duplicates by its own
policy (tough crapola client, you only get so much). An instance ID
makes this very simple to deal with. Otherwise you're at the mercy of
the client, or the server has to guess which subscriptions it has no more
resources to handle and should eliminate.

Same goes for registrations which was pointed out on another thread. If
a client is stateless enough that it can't remember an old contact after
crashing, it may still be able to come up with a GUID that the server can
then use to figure out to eliminate the now defunct elder contact in
favor of the newer one.

If we take that approach then how do we solve the problems I've stated
above that exist today? How do we solve problems with generating meaningful
identifiers for clients in the reginfo+xml message body, and cpim-pidf 
message bodies? How do I determine all PUBLISHes are from a particular 
user agent when it's contact information and other aspects of the PUBLISH 
may vary over long periods of time? 

We're going to have to solve these other issues. We're going to need to 
know which client is generating these requests. It's a similar problem
space,
and with or without GRUUs, these problems are still going to exist and will
eventually need to be tackled.

[Chris Boulton] My initial feeling here is that it should be the
client's responsibility on receiving a 200 class response with two
contacts + different GRUU's should de-register the one it doesn't
recognize (The one with the unknown instance ID).

This is an extremely old reference.  The name was changed to =20

The experience of the working group has shown that implementing a SIP =20=

ALG in a firewall is "a bad thing".  I have personal experience with =20
the failings of SIP ALGs at my own company, not the least of which is =20=

that they don't work at all when SIP is integrity-protected using TLS.

Many UAs now support RFC 3581 and can use the STUN protocol to get =20
valid public addresses and ports to advertise in SDP for their RTP =20
traffic. This has been relatively painless compared to working with the =20=

shortcomings of ALGs.

Hi Raphael,

Just as an FYI:  The "unpopular" encoding for H.248 is ASN.1 encoding=20
of the entire protocol.  What Cullen is proposing is sending all *MIME=20=

bodies* in SIP as a stream of raw binary data (like HTTP). This is=20
instead of sending SIP MIME bodes as a stream of base64-encoded data=20
for example, which is unnecessary in modern protocols, but was required=20=

in email for backwards compatibility reasons.

(btw: I vote for a)

thanks,

Hi Folks,

I just noticed a minor problem with publish ; it defines a new response 
code:

	412 Precondition Failed

which is confusingly similar to the existing response code:

	580 Precondition Failure

I propose changing The reason phrase for 412 to "Publication Condition 
Failed"

thanks,
-rohan

<smaller>> </smaller>

<smaller>> 4) Selection of a specific instance in an initial request:
We have a </smaller>

<smaller>> request that we wish to reach one specific instance of a
contact </smaller>

<smaller>> associated with an AoR. It has been proposed that we </smaller>

<smaller>> </smaller>

They are completely different transactions.  The proxy just forwards 
the 500 response normally.

Hi,

In future, please ask these types of "how to" questions on 
sip-implementors@cs.columbia.edu

UA2 should send its BYE request to the address in the Contact from UA1. 
  The transport parameter is optional, so if there is no transport 
parameter in its request URI, UA2 will use the default transport (UDP 
for sip:  and TCP for sips: ).  The response to the BYE will use the 
same transport as the request.

If you have a followup question, please post it to sip-implementors.

thanks,
-rohan

I'm fine with reusing existing work. What is HIP?

My primary point is to give the endpoint flexibility in the form of 
identifier it uses by representing the identifier as a URI.

Beyond that, I wanted to ensure that we had a way to use a mac address 
as one of the options. I didn't find a way to do that in URI/URN form, 
which is why I suggest defining a new URN namespace for this. If there 
is some other standard that already achieves this, fine.

I'm not at all attached to any particular way of using random numbers. 
I'm happy with pretty much anything that permits an instance of a 
software endpoint on a multi-user/multi-application box to come up with 
a guid.

I'm not suggesting *limiting* to macs and random numbers. Just that tese 
be available options.

The reason to use URIs/URNs is to manage the namespaces. Your MAC-based 
id may collide with my timestamp-based id if there isn't something to 
distinguish that they come from different namespaces. For that matter, 
your mac-based id may conflict with my mac-based id if we choose to 
format them differently.

By using URIs, there is always some specification that governs the 
format and defines uniqueness within that format, while the scheme name 
itself ensures uniqueness of ids generated based on different 
specifications.

You are right - there are other options.

That assumes it isn't done on purpose.

In any case, the whole concept of GRUUs is based on the uniqueness, so 
the registrar is bound to enforce this uniqueness, one way or another.

This is also problematic because it violates the invariant on which GURR 
is based - that it always represents a single endpoint.

I agree that the right choice here isn't immediately obvious. But having 
the registrar generate an error is a way to push the decision back on 
the endpoint. If it wants to prevail then it can send a new REGISTER 
that removes the old conflicting contact as well as adding its own new 
one. Or it can just give up.

Chris,

See my prior response to Jonathan and Brian. I agree it is the 
endpoint's responsibility to fix this. But the registrar still needs to 
preserve uniqueness of the identifier. Your proposal has the potential 
of having a non-unique identifier.

That's not really the point; the realm needs to provide enough of a hint
for the UA to determine which credentials it should use.  Setting up a
configuration that requires different credentials for the same realm at
different servers is dumb, and not something I think we need to spend
much worry on.

I don't think that we can mandate anything that is by nature an
administrative decision - we already provide good advice.  However, 3261
does say (22.1):

      o  Realm strings MUST be globally unique.  It is RECOMMENDED that
         a realm string contain a hostname or domain name, following the
         recommendation in Section 3.2.1 of RFC 2617 [17].

> Perhaps I was not clear in my text. Imagine this scenario: I have cached my credentials for an outbound proxy with realm proxy.nokia.com from an earlier transaction. Now I send a new INVITE routed through the outbound proxy that gets a 407 from a second proxy with the same realm. How do I know if the 407 came from the outbound proxy (the username password might have changed in the meantime) or from the next hop proxy?

What difference does it make?  You just use the credentials you have in
either case, or you fail...  As I pointed out, you can tell the
difference if the server is using qop.

Actually, it is, but it's the usual unfortunate incorrect intrepretation
of SHOULD that is biting us again.  RFC 2617 says:

   qop-options
     This directive is optional, but is made so only for backward
     compatibility with RFC 2069 [6]; it SHOULD be used by all
     implementations compliant with this version of the Digest scheme.

Since SIP references only 2617, and backward compatibility with 1867 is
not important, all SIP servers should be using qop-options.

The BNF is never the last word - the text MUST be read too, and the
requirement there is, I think, already clear.

Dear All,

=20

In draft-ietf-sip-nat-01.txt, there are SIP extensions for NAT =
traversal. The received and rport parameter are used to send back the =
responses correctly. However if we don't use these extensions, and =
change the via ip address and port with that of firewall/port then the =
SIP responses will come directly to firewall, in that case the firewall =
permits the responses. UA1 inside the network sends requests to =
firewall/NAT.

=20

UA1=20

INVITE sip:user@domain.com SIP/2.0 ----------------> Firewall/NAT        =
       ----------------------------------------------->UA2

Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 10.1.1.1:4540                          INVITE =
sip:user@domain.com SIP/2.0                            =20

Via: SIP/2.0/UDP firewall_ip:5060

                                                                        =
(Maintain mapping)=20

=20

the UA2 will send the responses to firewall/NAT and firewall/NAT will =
write back the addresses in Via to original IP/port. I understand from =
the draft, if there are no SIP ALG functionality in firewall, then the =
extensions are used to make SIP traverse through NAT. However if we =
implement SIP ALG in firewall then we can make SIP traverse through NAT. =
Can anybody tell that this way is per SIP spec.

=20

Thank you,

Anil

Upon reflection, this is an interesting theoretical problem that =
statistically is not a problem.

What is a Call-Id?  It is an opaque, globally unique string generated by =
the UAC.  To promote uniqueness, 3261 requires a string identifying the =
UAC, either IP address or hostname.  Note that NOTHING in SIP places =
semantics on the host part of the Call-Id.

So, in reality, don't bother to mung the Call-Id.  What is the =
likelihood of two UAC's having the following properties AT THE SAME =
TIME:
	same randomly generated LHS (unlikely, but possible)
	same IP address (possible)
	same destination (very unlikely)

IIF all of these conditions are SIMULTANEOUSLY true, then there is a =
problem, in that there will be two dialogs with the same dialog =
identifier.  You've got bigger problems then what to change an IP =
address to :-)


That said, if the reason you are munging the Call-Id host part is for =
network hiding, then you really, really, really should be hacking the =
user part, as well.  I'll leave the security considerations section as =
an exercise for the reader.

P.S., this whole thing breaks lots of stuff.  I'm sure Henry will revoke =
my License to SIP for even explaining some of it :-)

The NAT/FW must not go changing this stuff. If it does, a S/MIME signed =

            I have a question about CallId. Suppose two UA's generate =

            Because those callid information contain IP addresses, the =

I agree that you shouldn't muck with the call-id, but for different 
reasons. From 3261:

    In a new request created by a UAC outside of any dialog, the Call-ID
    header field MUST be selected by the UAC as a globally unique
    identifier over space and time unless overridden by method-specific
    behavior.  All SIP UAs must have a means to guarantee that the Call-
    ID header fields they produce will not be inadvertently generated by
    any other UA.

A UA behind a NAT can't use its IP address in its call-id because that 
won't be guaranteed to be unique. It might be able to use its DNS name. 
If it doesn't have one, then it is still obligated to come up with 
something unique. Otherwise it is just broken.

The callId's are changed to call1@firewall_ip, call1@firewall_ip. When responses come back from their respective UAS's the firewall/NAT translates the it's IP address in callId's to their original IP's. My question is should I change the string "call1" to something generated by firewall or Is it OK to leave like that. Even though they have same CallId, the proxy should discriminate the calls by from-tag, callid, and to-tag.

Good point -- if you are going to be a B2BUA, you have to follow the =
*UA* rules, e.g., generate new, unique Call-Id's.

All -

At the request of the chairs, I split the non-invite
draft into three parts :

- the description of the problems
- the things we seem to have consensus to fix now
- the things we might do in the future but need to
  argue over more.


The resulting drafts are available in the repository:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-problems-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-future-00.txt


My recommendation is to LC the problems and actions drafts
as soon as it is feasible to do so and send them to the IESG.

RjS

I would like to see us revisit the BNF for Call-ID at
some point and explicitly make its value a single bundle
of opaque bits.

It almost is already - it is defined as word @ word
(NOT word @ host). 

There are implementations that have been mislead by
the recommendation to use a host for the second
word (as a source of probably-unique bits) into
_parsing_ that field from received messages as 
a host (as defined in the BNF in 3261), and 
rejecting messages (or breaking) when the bits
they found didn't line up.

I'm willing to bet that a very large subset of
the existing implementations in the world would
not deal with two "@" signs show up gracefully.
(Something to add to the torture tests maybe).

We can make this less likely to occur in the future.

Subsection 4.1 (General Rules)  gave an example behavior of a SIP 
element supporting this
specification as:

  ... "For example, for SUBSCRIBE, a higher-priority request
   may get preferential treatment if storage or bandwidth for
   notifications are scarce, possibly displacing a lower-priority
   subscription."

Is this suggesting that resources allocated to a lower priority request
can be reclaimed for a higher priority one (say in the case of scarce
storage space)?  If that is the case, how are the clients of the lower
priority request notified of their misfortune?

Regards,
Alex.

SUBSCRIBE is never a guarantee or contract of delivery. The notifier can 
decide, for any reason whatsoever, to stop delivering notifications at 
any time. This is just one more, along with "I don't feel like it any 
more". It's unfortunate, but priority always involves stiffing the 
little guy in some way.

(The more likely behavior is that a system that is bandwidth-constrained 
might prioritize notifications resulting from a PUBLISH. It simply sends 
notifications in order of priority until the next PUBLISH arrives; the 
ones low on the totem pole might never get notified.)

Eric,

You can't make it a token an remain backward compatible with 3261.

I support tightening up the semantics. But you can't just say it must be 
  a globally unique value in space and time without giving some guidance 
on how to partition the namespace so that developers don't pick 
conflicting techniques.

Even changing to word@host would be slightly incompatible. But perhaps 
it could be specified that the form word@host should not be used unless 
the application generating the callid can assure that no other entity is 
using the same value of host to generate callids.

	Paul

There is one critical difference between an ALG and a SIP proxy or =20
B2BUA.

ALGs don't insert Via headers, Contact, Record-Route, Route, etc..  =20
They just rewrite stuff going by on the wire, assuming that packets =20
will happen to go through this particular firewall of NAT on their way =20=

to the "outside".

SIP intermediaries insert some sort of SIP identifier so that requests =20=

and responses get routed to them.

In this way, ALGs are much, much worse.

Hi Rohan,

=20

            Thanks for pointing me to right RFC. I am thinking that how =
many
UA's correctly support this STUN protocol. I am thinking that we need =
to add
SIP ALG in NAT that if we want to support UA's that don't support any =
SIP
NAT extensions and STUN protocol. I thought that this supporting all =
SIP
aware functionality in ALG is difficult as changes made to SIP protocol =
need
to accommodate in SIP ALG.=20

Thanks,

Anil

draft-ietf-sip-symmetric-response, and is now published as RFC 3581.=20

=20

However if we don't use these extensions, and change the via ip address =
and
port with that of firewall/port then the SIP responses will come =
directly to
firewall, in that case the firewall permits the responses. UA1 inside =
the
network sends requests to firewall/NAT.=20

=20

the UA2 will send the responses to firewall/NAT and firewall/NAT will =
write
back the addresses in Via to original IP/port. I understand from the =
draft,
if there are no SIP ALG functionality in firewall, then the extensions =
are
used to make SIP traverse through NAT. However if we implement SIP ALG =
in
firewall then we can make SIP traverse through NAT. Can anybody tell =
that
this way is per SIP spec.=20

=20

The experience of the working group has shown that implementing a SIP =
ALG in
a firewall is "a bad thing". I have personal experience with the =
failings of
SIP ALGs at my own company, not the least of which is that they don't =
work
at all when SIP is integrity-protected using TLS.=20

=20

Many UAs now support RFC 3581 and can use the STUN protocol to get =
valid
public addresses and ports to advertise in SDP for their RTP traffic. =
This
has been relatively painless compared to working with the shortcomings =
of
ALGs.=20

SIPIT 14 took place Feb 9 to 13, 2004 in Mandelieu, France.
The event was hosted by ETSI Plugtests. 

If you aren't familiar with SIPITs, please review the
information at http://www.sipit.net . 

This is a summary of what I observed:

There were roughly 128 attendees from 55 organizations.
Participants came from the US, Canada, Israel, Japan, 
Taiwan, France, Germany, Belgium, UK, Turkey, India, Sweden,
Finland, and Norway. Roughly 1/5 of the implementations had
not been to a previous SIPIT.

Startup at this event was more stressful than normal - we had a 
shipment of switches go awry and there was a good deal of last minute
creative network engineering, leading to a good deal of support
work on Monday. We resolved that by Monday night and had a solid
network for the remainder of the event. Still - the infrastructure
volunteers were up ridiculous hours the whole week. I have plans
to improve that. We started training a "loading crew" to help
with future events, and we are refining our kit and our requirements
on the host. If you're a regular SIPIT attendee and are willing
to help, please send me a note.

Overall, the state of interoperability at the event continues to
improve. The biggest strides between this event and the last were
around correct support for TLS. The biggest weakness continues
to be proper construction of offers and answers. Folks know
where to put their SDP, but can't agree what to put in it.
The offer-answer-examples draft is helping, but we may need
to do more.

We found a few places to work on clarifying the specification:

 - The merge detection language covers initial requests, but
   not in-dialog requests. We don't expect in-dialog requests
   to diverge and merge, but there are edge cases where it
   can happen (such as through NAPTR/SRV failover). This became
   particularly important when elements "optimized" failover,
   shorting over to the next SRV record after 4 seconds of no
   response instead of waiting for a full transaction timeout.

 - We inherit HEXDIG from 2234 (I think, this isn't super clear).
   That RFC allows only uppercase letters for hex digits. We 
   defined LHEX to deal with that for digest challenges (where
   we allow only lower case in the syntax). But - ipv6 addresses
   can realistically take either case. We need something new.

 - There were several UAs that puked on Call-IDs that had an
   @ sign in them where the stuff after the @ sign was a
   quoted ([]) IPv6 address (which happened when a request went
   through a v6tov4 gateway). We really should deprecate the
   '@' form from the BNF, replacing the whole header field
   value with an opaque bitstring.

 - It was not clear to all implementors that an in-dialog
   REFER was a target refresh request (hence MUST have a
   single Contact HFV. Bug 750 captures this.

 - An optimization question came up: If you parallel fork
   over UDP to n legs, leg 1 answers, leg 2-n have not yet 
   responded (at all, so you can't send a CANCEL). Do you 
   still have to continue retransmitting the request on
   legs 2-n, or can you squelch them? (You would have to
   keep the transaction around to deal with a response if
   it came, of course).

 - Empty reason phrases broke lots of people - we will add
   these to the torture-test draft. Note that the BNF still
   requires a space after the Status-Code even if the phrase
   is empty.

 - We had another example of Table 2 causing more confusion
   than not - a new registrar decided it was ok not to include
   the current bindings in REGISTER responses since table 2
   listed Contact as optional in that context.

I was able to interview 46 of the 55 organizations. Here are
some observations from those notes - treat all the numbers
as approximations.

- 20 did not support TLS, but 5 of those plan to by the next
  event. (So we're running at about half the implementations
  supporting TLS.) All but one implementation was built on top
  of openssl. Only 6 implementations supported sips:

- We had two implementations of event-lists (and they interoperated)

- Only four implementations did not support loose-routing.

- around 10 implementations supported IPv6. 

- Only 9 implementations understood UPDATE

- I noted 12 implementations supported NAPTR+SRV, 4 SRV only, 8 do 
  A lookups only, and 4 did no DNS at all. My notes only captured this
  information for roughly half the teams, but I think the proportions
  are representative.

- 7 implementations supported S/MIME

- 18 implementations supported PRACK

- UA implementations (including proxies and b2buas) outnumbered 
  proxy/registrar implementations around 4 to 1.

- There were fewer SIMPLE implementations (and most of the ones 
  present were presence server only). Many teams left their SIMPLE
  work at home, waiting for a SIMPLEt.


The multiparty tests at this event were similar to those of
the past. The spiral test continues to have the highest 
participation and yields the most implementation bugs. We
refined the test scenario for REFER, setting up a star topology
that lets us configure once and run many scenarios. We ran a
NAPTR/SRV failover test that was intricate. Several implementations
performed correctly when it became necessary to fail-over. We
exposed one that was only taking the first returned record of
a given type, and others that got their weighting algorithms
backwards. We didn't have many STUN implementations, but those
that were there worked together. We only had one SIGCOMP 
implementation show up this time.

Of course, the second address is bogus. The correct

Apologies now to those who will "Reply-All" to the

Hi Cullen,

I'd vote for 'b', not because the idea is stupid but because it is 
unnecessary.  Why restrict the ability of the end-point service to 
choose the most efficient encoding for its purposes?  If that happens to 
be 'binary' then great, but if not, that's OK, too.

I agree with this sentiment from your draft:

> ... it is reasonable to suggest that SIP implementations send one type 
> of encoding


However, this is at odds with the ultimate recommendation of your draft:

> Devices MUST use a content transfer encoding of "binary" for MIME body 
> parts in SIP messages they send.


If the problem is that implementors are inappropriately choosing Base64 
due to lack of sufficient guidance, I would prefer to see "Devices 
SHOULD use ..." instead.  It provides the needed guidance and yet does 
not arbitrarily close doors on possible future implementations.

Bryan.

It not about setting different credentials for the same realm. It is =
about pre-configuring the wrong credentials for a realm. If my phone is =
preconfigured with username: hisham, password: hishampass, realm: =
nokia.com and:

--> INVITE
<-- 407
--> INVITE
<-- 407 (credentials where wrong)

At this stage, the user should be prompted to enter new =
username/password. My objection is to the text quoted below from =
RFC3261:

"  A service provider that pre-configures UAs with credentials for its
   realm should be aware that users will not have the opportunity to
   present their own credentials for this realm when challenged at a
   pre-configured device".

I think the users should have the opportunity.

MUST be globally unique for every proxy in the same administrative =

It matters because the UA doesn't know if the credentials supplied to =
the first proxy were wrong and therefore is sending another 407 or if =
the second proxy is challenging with the same realm. The qop ting you =

This is all great, although I prefer for this to be called out =
explicitly for SIP, making the SHOULD a MUST. Also, there is nothing =
mandating a proxy to send the Authentication-info header. Perhaps that =
aught to be mandated also if a proxy server proxies a request it had =
previously challenged and another proxy downstream challenges the same =
request with the same realm.

Ok, although it is only implied that message-qop MUST appear in =
Authentication-info header if the earlier challenge/response contained =
the qop.

Absolutely -- rport is very essential part of the story as it adds lot of
robustness to traversal of SIP transactions over NATs. Sending replies
back symmetricaly simply works. Not using rport leads to all kind of
instabilities such as missed SIP replies when STUN address in Via without
rport becomes invalid for whatever reason.

Besides that, adding rport to UAC is banal.

I sort of agree and sort of don't. The only important thing about MAC is
that most phone vendors have it on the outside of the box and you can read
it with a barcode scanner. If a user goes to some configuration web page and
see that they have 2 devices registered, they have some hope of finding an
identifier on the back of the phone (the MAC) that they can match to one of
the two instances on the web page.

I don't think this unique instance identifier thing had much to do with
billing or debugging. I'm imagine a case something like the following:

I have two offices, one on the west side of the building and one of the
east. They both have phones registered as fluffy. Because it is better for
lounging in the Sun, I spend the morning in the East office and afternoon in
the West. Right now I can't write a proxy that forward to the correct one.

If I was using SUBSCRIBE to support event notification of provisioning
changes, I would not be able to identify which phone was subscribing.

Just to be clear, I am not *advocating* that we need these identifiers 
any other place. I'm just saying that if there are other uses for a 
device id, that it won't hurt to use the same id elsewhere.

For the purpose we are discussing, it is important that the id be 
associated with a registered contact, and since REGISTER permits 
multiple contacts, it really needs to be a parameter on each contact.

That is really an entirely different application from identifying which 
device originated a particular message. If there is a need for that, 
then it needs to be in some header that can be in any message. I don't 
recommend we do that until we have a need for it.

Just to be clear, I don't want it to have multiple possible place it could
be in a SIP message and I have to go traipsing around the message trying
here then there unless it is a FOO message where you look over here. A
header would work or caller pref but I don't see an argument for doing both.
I want it just one place.

The case with PUBLISH not having contact header had concerned me (actually I
think this was a mistake) but seems what happens in PIDF bodies could be
different.

I was hoping it would only be conferences. If it is more than that, then I
would need to know what I should expect to find when I load the document the
URI points at.

Good point. 

I think that all they ways I can imagine getting indirect content, HTTP,
FTP, TFTP, NFS, SMB, file are all 8 bit safe so I think this argument
probably still holds.

You are right - 3261 definitely allows binaries bodies.

I am just trying to suggest that it would be better to send MIME bodies with
a transfer encoding set to binary instead of base64 when sending them. Right
now SIP allows either, the examples are in base64, but binary is probably a
better choice. It seems like it should not be a big deal but it has been one
of the frustrating interoperability issues in getting S/MIME to work.

No I don't think this is a good idea. Putting a FQDN that is behind a NAT is
not any more likely to be resolvable to a routeable IP address. A private IP
is much easier to recognize and debug. Many hosts think they know their
hostname but do not and they should not put in an address that is not
routable in any domain. For example. most things, be it windows or unix,
will report a hostname when really they got their IP address from DHCP and
the hostname they are reporting is not in DNS.

Here's my recommendation for IP phones, softphones - always use an IP in via
and contacts unless you are positive that your FQDN really is in the global
DNS and you have a specific reason to use DNS (like multiple NICs for
redundancy).

I sat for a long time looking at that one MUST and trying to decide if it
should be a SHOULD. I also avoided mentioning what Henning points is the
more interesting question of what must all UAs be willing to receive.

So I take if you would be happy to see is say that things SHOULD send binary
but need to be prepared to receive anything.

I can live with that. Fits a certain stringent in what you send, lenient in
what you receive model that I like. I doubt that implementers will be busy
to go off and implement receiving multiple different things when there is no
apparent value to doing that. It would solve my one really key issues which
is that I would like to give enough guidance on the minimum to implement
that things like S/MIME had a better chance of working together.

Hi Cullen,

I am for 'a'. However, there may be some proxy severs who have the 
capability in handling 8-bit (text) data, not binary data. There may be 
an impact on all SIP entities including proxy servers that need not 
handle S/MIME data. 

Regards,
Kumiko

Folks,

it seems that some people in the ITU-T are having some issues figuring 
out whether or not certain requests can be sent by the UAS within an 
early dialog. The confusion comes from statements like this one (taken 
from the INFO spec):

"     Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the INFO request
       governing the usage of tags, Route and Record-Route,
       retransmission and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message
       formatting follow those in [1] as defined for the BYE request."

Since a UAS does not send BYEs within an early dialog, but a non-2xx 
final response instead, to terminate the dialog, people assume that INFO 
cannot be sent in this situation either.

Let's try to keep this in mind and clarify this point when/if we define 
new SIP methods.

In any event, the clarification to this issue can be found in RFC 3398:

"From the callee to the caller, if a message is received by a gateway
    before the call has been answered (i.e., ANM is received) it SHOULD
    be encapsulated in an INFO, provided that this will not be the first
    SIP message sent in the backwards direction (in which case it SHOULD
    be encapsulated in a provisional 1xx response)."

Regards,

Gonzalo

The problem is that the ITU-T interworking spec doesn't reference RFC3398. The spec reference the INFO RFC, and that is also where I think the usage rules should be defined (not in another spec, RFC3398 in this case, simply using the method).

The INFO RFC, as you said, currently says that INFO "follows the rules of BYE" (whatever that means is another question :), and the rules for BYE specifically says that it must not be sent backward before the INVITE has finished. If the INFO RFC would say "follow the rules of UPDATE" we would not have this problem, since the UPDATE spec specifically allows the use of the method before the INVITE has finished.

Thanks!

Christer,

would the ITU-T be happier if we log an errata against the INFO RFC 
saying that UASs can send INFO within early dialogs?

I don't know how happy it would be, but at least it wouldn't have to spend time on this relatively minor issue :)

I tend to agree with Paul (if I read him correctly).

=20

I think that GUID and the original GRID parameter are very different
things because of their properties (and obviously the resultant usage
cases).

Below is my view on the topic.

=20

1. Global Unique ID: GUID IS a very well-known concept. It is used by
many applications outside SIP, but I don't see its direct relation to
SIP. I am not sure whether we need a dedicated SIP placeholder for it.
For PIDF applications, GRUU is enough, in my opinion (see below).

=20

2. GRUU format: GRUU (not GRID or GUID) is a SIP URI and is very SIPish
concept with the properties as defined in the GRUU draft. It IS the "SIP
Instance Identifier". Being a SIP URI, it can be used in any Presence
(e.g. PIDF) applications without changing the defined XML schemas. It
may be beneficial to define a URI parameter that says: "This SIP URI has
GRUU properties". It will eliminate the need for Supported: gruu in
every message and for potential expanding the PIDF documents to include
this clarification.=20

=20

3. GRUU signaling and usage: GRUU can be allocated either by Registrar,
or by UA, or by different means. My point is GRUU identification (i.e.
placement and signaling) during session establishment and usage
(especially outside the Registrar domain) MUST be identical for all
cases. Moreover, it MUST be possible for the Registrar domain to conceal
the information about the allocation method being used.

=20

4. Registration Procedure: We need to standardize the registration
procedure for both basic cases: GRUU allocated by Server (done) and GRUU
allocated by Client. In my opinion, both cases need to be under the
Registration/contact umbrella - which makes them SIP concepts! Whether
GRUU value is preserved during client's/server's reboots - it doesn't
change the concept. From usability point of view, it would be very nice
to keep the value as long as possible. From the outside user point of
view - it doesn't need to know (and doesn't want to know) what the
registration durability of its peers is.

=20

5. Saving Registration Cycles and DB size: By using GRUU we have the
ability to contact a specific instance of SIP AOR. Once we point to a
specific entity, we MAY also need to point to specific sub-entities
inside this GRUU. This will save the registration burden from each of
these sub-entities, since they will be covered by GRUU's registration
and routing. The original GRID parameters allowed for exactly this
functionality. The usage example is a conference factory which generates
foci and doesn't need to dynamically REGISTER each of them in order to
achieve proper routing. BTW, the concept of "internal routing" to
specific logical module inside SIP entity can be generalized, decoupled
from GRUU and be defined as a dedicated SIP header.

=20

Orit.

Subject: Re: [Sip] SIP instance identifiers

=20

Just to be clear, I am not *advocating* that we need these identifiers=20

any other place. I'm just saying that if there are other uses for a=20

device id, that it won't hurt to use the same id elsewhere.

=20

For the purpose we are discussing, it is important that the id be=20

associated with a registered contact, and since REGISTER permits=20

multiple contacts, it really needs to be a parameter on each contact.

=20

That is really an entirely different application from identifying which=20

device originated a particular message. If there is a need for that,=20

then it needs to be in some header that can be in any message. I don't=20

recommend we do that until we have a need for it.

=20

Hi All,

            For any SIP message, if UA or Proxy sending message than other
than from port 5060, then it should be included in SIP from URI. For
example, if the Register message comes from 202.10.10.20:2218, the From
header should look like From: sip:joe@202.10.10.20:2218. Is it MUST if the
port is different than port 5060 then it should appear in the From header?

 

Thanks in Advance,

Anil

Hi All,

 

      I understand from the following statement in RFC, that From header
SHOULD not contain IP addresses/ports from whom the request has come. If it
is so, I can't assume that the information is not used to assume from where
(IP address/port) the request has come. Appreciate your response to clarify
the point.

 

  As such, it is very important that the From URI not contain IP addresses
or the FQDN

   of the host on which the UA is running, since these are not logical

   names.

 

Thank you,

Anil

While RFC 3398 may appear to clarify this, it is not in the scope of RFC 3398 to do so.

RFC 3398 defines only the interworking, not the SIP protocol associated with it.

I would suggest a bug fix is tables for the INFO RFC.

Keith

The ITU-T (Study Group 11, to be exact) had a different issue with INFO: that the 
RFC depends on RFC 2543 rather than 3261.  As a result, they picked up the content 
of RFC 2976 as Annex C.3 of the ISUP interworking specification Q.1912.5.  If RFC 
2976 ever gets updated Annex C.3 can be deprecated.  In the meantime, this INFO 
question means we have some maintenance to perform.  I think the best solution 
will be to take Gonzalo's suggestion and say that INFO follows the rules for 
UPDATE.  We already have a normative dependency on the UPDATE RFC.

The Via header tells that IP address/port where the response should be sent.
It does not specify from where the request has been come, as the ports for
sending request and receiving responses can be different. I think the only
way we can tell is by seeing the sending ip and port in IP header of the
packet. Please correct if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Anil

I don't know that anyone is talking about this. But we are talking about=20
a slightly more restricted concept - a Device ID. Conceivably a device=20

that is sip routable. But it isn't necessarily defined for as long as=20

Maybe it can be decoupled from GRUU, but I think it must be coupled to a=20
URL, not a message. So it must be a URL formatting convention and/or a=20
url parameter. So maybe you could generalize the grid parameter to apply=20
to all sip/sips urls, rather than coupling it to gruu. I haven't thought=20
thru where that might be useful.

I find the newest version of this draft troubling. It feels to me like 
it has selected a slippery slope and is already accelerating rapidly 
downward.

My major concern is with the approach described in section 4:

    Alternatively, the Refer-To URI could be a Universal Resource Name
    (URN) [21] which could describe a particular operation such as Hold
    or Retrieve.  Combined with the dialog-identifiers of an existing
    session conveyed as parameters of the Refer-To header, this would
    permit explicit operations which do not need additional parameters or
    handle more than a single session.  For example, the following could
    represent a Hold operation of a session with the Call-ID "123":

    	Refer-To: <urn:ietf:params:sip:remotecc:hold>
    	 ;call-id=123;remote-tag=aaa;local-tag=bbb

Further examples are given abstractly, for example:

     --------------------------------
     | Remote Call Control Body     |
     | transfer                     |
     |   FirstCall=                 |
     |     sip:line1@192.168.0.5    |
     |     call-id:456              |
     |     remote-tag=uvw           |
     |     local-tag=xyz            |
     |   SecondCall=                |
     |     sip:cathy@example.net    |
     |   other parameters           |
     --------------------------------

My concern is that this appears to be defining an explicit feature 
invocation model, with specific features that have names and parameters. 
While it could conceivably be in scope for IETF to define things to this 
level, in the past the sip wg has avoided doing so. If that philosophy 
is to change, then I think we must consider all the implications of 
doing so.

I think every feature of this sort will require a considerable effort to 
specify in sufficient detail so that interoperation is assured. It may 
be that we are already in that situation with REFER and just haven't 
realized it yet, but I am inclined to think this makes that situation worse.

I don't think the features as described go far enough to define their 
semantics. In particular, I think it is difficult to define the meaning 
of these features without addressing media handling and the management 
of explicit UI components of the endpoint. For instance, what does 
MakeCall imply about the UI and media handling on the device that is to 
make a call? Is the user alerted first, with the device awaiting an 
off-hook before completing the call? Or are the microphone and speaker 
in the handset activated for media even though the phone is on-hook? If 
the device is capable of using multiple media, which are enabled in the 
call? The questions abound.

More generally, must all endpoints that support extended-refer support 
every feature that might be named in a Remote Call Control Body? If so, 
how do we evolve the set of features? If not, how does a UA determine 
what features it can invoke, and how?

The approach of simply enhancing Refer-To with header parameters that 
simplify the construction of complex referred operations is more 
bounded, and less likely to present issues in the future. Of course it 
may or may not be sufficient for the kinds of call control people may 
want to do remotely.

Whatever the overlap in our views is, what is in the scope of this
discussion and what is out of the scope - is a point of view based on
the applications each of us is familiar with.

If we=20
- have both the GRUU concept and the GRID concept as URI parameters
- allow a user to allocated its own device identifier (which needs to be
"globally" unique within its AOR scope only)
- allow a Registrar to override the user allocated GRUU and replace it
with Registrar generated value (if required according to local policies)

it will satisfy the requirements of the applications that I am familiar
with.

Maybe it can be decoupled from GRUU, but I think it must be coupled to a
URL, not a message. So it must be a URL formatting convention and/or a
url parameter. So maybe you could generalize the grid parameter to apply
to all sip/sips urls, rather than coupling it to gruu. I haven't thought
thru where that might be useful.

Hi Anil,

If I understand you correctly then I think you want to know the sender's
IP and port number. This information can be obtaine from the SDP. Via
header gives information of Proxy not of sender's.

The Via header tells that IP address/port where the response should be
sent. It does not specify from where the request has been come, as the
ports for sending request and receiving responses can be different. I
think the only way we can tell is by seeing the sending ip and port in
IP header of the packet. Please correct if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Anil

Tom,

what is the timeframe here? As you know, we have had discussions in the 
past about either re-defining INFO so that it can only carry PSTN 
telephony signalling, or defining INFO packages. We could re-start those 
discussions, and once we reach a conclusion, clarify the rules to send 
INFO from the UAS within early dialogs in the same spec...

If the ITU is in a hurry, other solutions may be better, like logging an 
errata against the INFO RFC.

Hi,=20
RFC 3581-Symmetric Response Routing specifies that the rport parameter =
should be used only if the transport is unreliable.

"When a server attempts to send a response, it examines the topmost
   Via header field value of that response.  If the "sent-protocol"
   component indicates an unreliable unicast transport protocol, such as
   UDP, and there is no "maddr" parameter, but there is both a
   "received" parameter and an "rport" parameter, the response MUST be
   sent to the IP address listed in the "received" parameter, and the
   port in the "rport" parameter.  The response MUST be sent from the
   same address and port that the corresponding request was received on.
   This effectively adds a new processing step between bullets two and
   three in Section 18.2.2 of SIP [1]."

As I see it, the same problem that rport solves in UDP can happen in =
TCP.
This can happen if the connection is broken between the request and the =
response.

If for example the Via header in the request is:

Via: SIP/2.0/TCP proxy.example.com;branch=3Dz9hG4bKkjsh77

and proxy.example.com was resolved to a port different then 5060, the =
server will not be able to=20
establish a new connection in order to send the response since 5060 will =
be used.

Why do we have the UDP limitation in the standard?
How can such a problem be solved.

Regards,
Sarit.

No the sender address and port should not be obtained from the SDP.
The IP and port found in the SDP only tells the receiver where to
send media, nothing else. The IP in the SDP does not have to be the
same IP as from where the SIP signaling is done. The port in the SDP
will probably always differ from the port from where the SIP
signaling is done (I don't think any implementation would like
to demux SIP and media on the same port)

Hi
  I am recent to the group and have been reading and getting interested 
about encodings in SIP (e.g
MIME encoding proposal postings by Cullen).

I also noted that Henning in one of his papers (Oct 2000, IEEE Comm 
magazine),
refers to a work where Java applets were proposed to be included in SIP 
requests for
service creation.

 I am interested if there is any progress made in this specific aspect? 
In fact, encoding
executable content on SIP requests can be powerful abstraction and can 
be usefully utized for
a lot of other things (not only service creation). But it can also 
create otentially serious security issues...
(This is also somewhat similar to binary MIME encodings in SIP, in which 
case the question arises how
such encodings are interpreted.)

 I am just wondering if any work is done on this..

Thanks & Regards, Gokul

Pl post reply to the MG and not to me. Thx.

Please try and get any slides in well in advance.

Note that GRUU-related stuff appears on both SIPPING and SIP agendas. 
The idea is to discuss requirements in SIPPING and mechanism in SIP.

Folks,

I submitted a revision of the session timer, based on comments received 
from IESG and subsequent list discussion. For some reason, this 
submission was not processed by the I-D editor (I'm working to correct 
that). In the mean time, you can pick it up at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-14.txt


There are a few significant changes:

* Formerly, if a session refresh timed out, the UA waited until 1/3 of 
the session interval remained before sending a BYE. This contradicts 
RFC3261 which basically says to send a BYE immediately. Session timer 
now references that behavior.

* There is now an absolute minimum session timer of 90 seconds. This is 
basically enough time for completion of a SIP BYE transaction after half 
of the session has expired. The Min-SE header field now has a default 
value of 90 seconds when not present. This will preclude usage of 
session timer for really fine grained refreshes, say on the order of 5 
to 10 seconds. I fear that some people may be trying to do some kind of 
nat traversal or something with session timer - this would rule that out 
formally (it was never the intended usage).

* The default for session-expires, when not present, used to be 
"infinity". However, thats not really right. Really, it means 
"undefined", and session expiration is then up to local policy of the 
proxy. Using infinity would mean that a proxy could never clean up state.


Please comment ASAP if you have any problems with these changes. We'd 
like to get session timer moving along.

-Jonathan R.

Good point. A question though: since we're borrowing this response code 
from HTTP, how strictly do we need to keep the reason phrases aligned? I 
assume it's enough that the semantics are the same, and the default 
reason phrase can therefore be different.

Also, to generalize, would:

	412 (Conditional Request Failed)

be better?

Cheers,
Aki

Hisham,

in your draft below, you mention that Jonathan pointed out that:

" It was also discovered that there was no IANA registry set up for the
    "purpose" parameter in the Call-info header of the Session Initiation
    Protocol [1]. This document sets up the IANA registry."

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-khartabil-sip-policy-uri-call-info-purpose-00

When I check the registry, defined in the draft below, I can see that 
"purpose" was already registered (page 6).

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-parameter-registry-01.txt

Hi:

No problems with the following changes. However, a different
question. Can someone explain the rational for not allowing
a proxy/UAS to _increase_ the session expiration before=20
accepting it? I understand that the proxy/UAS can effect this
increase by responding with the 422 but then every call
(from that UAC) requires multiple INVITE exchanges. Is it=20
really the case that we expect the UAC to get a 422 and decide=20
it doesn't want the call after all because the session expiration=20
would be too big? In any event, if this were the case, couldn't=20
the UAC just BYE the call at that point?

Thanks in advance for the info.

Cheers,
Shaun

I know whenever we bring up billing people turn off, but one of the things
session timer is useful for is to tear down calls that got hosed somewhere.
Making the min 90 seconds means you could not use the mechanism -- you would
have to have some other mechanism that didn't distort your billing record
so much.  90 seconds is an eternity in human time. 

Somehow, precluding use for NAT binding keepalive doesn't sound like
a good enough reason to have such a high min.  I frankly don't understand
why there has to be a min at all; surely it depends on the characteristics
of the network the session traverses.

Hi Gonzalo,

You're right - the parameter registration is handled by the below draft. 
But what is missing is a registry for the 'purpose' values. That's what 
we're porposing to set up, and populate with the already defined set of 
{icon, info, card} per RFC3261, and the new proposed 'policy-uri' value.

Cheers,
Aki

I see a problem with this change. What you say makes sense for proxies, 
but it doesn't make sense for a UAC or UAS. For them, infinity is the 
right default, because in this case they don't refresh. In the absence 
of a session-expires the UAC and UAS can't know the proxy's policy. 
Perhaps the wording needs separated out for proxy and UA.

The new wording is:

    The default value of the Session-Expires header field is undefined.
    This means that absence of the Session-Expires header field implies
    no expiration of the session using the mechanism defined in this
    specification. Note that other mechanisms not defined in this
    specification, such as locally configured timers, may apply.

while the old wording was:

    The default value of the Session-Expires header field, when not
    present, is infinity. This means that absence of the Session-Expires
    header field implies no expiration.

How about the following as a compromise:

    The default value of the Session-Expires header field, when not
    present, is infinity. For UAC and UAS this means that absence of
    the Session-Expires header field implies the session timer will
    never expire, so no BYE will be sent on expiration, and no refreshes
    will be performed. This also implies that proxies must make their
    own determination of how long to retain state in the absence of
    any messages within the dialog.

	Paul

Hi,

yes, when we were creating the registries for header field and URI 
parameters I thought of creating another registry for the values of some 
parameters (e.g., the one you are dealing with)... but given the huge 
amount of discussions we had on the other registries, I gave up for the 
time being...

In any case, I will check what is going on with the IANA and get back to 
you...

Gonzalo

Check for what? The absence of this registry is a bug in RFC3261; it 
should have been created there (indeed, its mentioned in the spec, but 
there are no IANA considerations associated with it). So, we need to set 
it up.

Jonathan,

 > Check for what?

as you know, we both agree on this, and that's why we set both 
registries up... nevertheless, I have heard from the IANA (and from the 
IESG about the IANA) that they are overloaded and that we should not 
hold our breath waiting for the RFCs-to-be defining the registries to be 
published as RFCs...

Since we will have *many* RFCs-to-be that will depend on these 
registries and on any new registry we may need to create, I want to make 
sure that the IANA understands that we are in a hurry. That's whay I am 
going to check...

Q.1912.5 is in the process of final approval.  Logging errata may be satisfactory 
-- I'd have to check.  It would certainly be more comfortable than reproducing the 
RFC with modifications in the ITU document.  If the IETF acts within the next two 
weeks we should be able to remove the Annex from the Recommendation.

Here is the current list of changes as reported at the beginning of the Annex.

"The SIP INFO method is documented in RFC 2976. However, that RFC refers to RFC 
2543, the previous version of the SIP specification, rather than to RFC 3261. The 
text of this Annex reproduces RFC 2976 with changes to reflect the updated reference.

"The changes made are as follows:

"Paragraph C.3.2.1: The references to the tables of RFC2543 were changed to 
reflect the new table organization in RFC 3261.

"Paragraph C.3.2: The tables 1 and 2 were replaced by new tables that show the 
header fields defined as presented in RFC3261. All additional headers (additional 
to RFC 2543) used within RFC3261 were here set to optional with two exceptions. 
The Reply-To (only optional for the INVITE) and Call-Info Header (only used for 
INVITE, OPTIONS, REGISTER to give additional information about the caller or 
callee) are not used with the INFO method.

"Paragraph C.3.6: The reference was changed to the current SIP specification, RFC 
3261.

Responses are sent to the Via address, though more commonly to the 
source IP/port of the request when TCP is used, or when rport is used 
(RFC 3581) with UDP. The IP/port in the Via effectively provide a 
fallback, to be used for the server to re-initiate a connection to the 
client in the event of failure to send the response.

Subsequent requests in a dialog are sent to the Contact URI.

 From is a logical identifier, used for display and policy purposes. 
Please, please don't muck with it.

Let me take this opportunity to preach a little on the role of ALGs in a 
network.

As a general rule, ALGs are quite problematic. They don't work in 
conjunction with most of the SIP security mechanisms, including S/MIME 
but more importantly sips and TLS. Their spotty presence in a network, 
generally undetectable to application entities in the network, cannot be 
depended on, and therefore can never serve as a complete solution for an 
application service provider. Worse yet, when (and I say when, not if) 
one of these ALGs does something wrong that breaks a call flow, it 
becomes almost impossible to diagnose and correct. Generally speaking, 
application layer intelligence does not belong in the core of the 
network; that brings us back to the days of single-service networks 
where the whole network needs to be upgraded to support a new 
application. ALGs are contrary to the hourglass model that is one of the 
defining characteristics of IP.

I much prefer solutions like ICE, STUN, TURN and MIDCOM, which separate 
application layer intelligence from firewalls and NATs, and allow for 
applications to do the right thing for themselves for the purposes of 
NAT traversal.

As such, the right model is to NOT build an ALG, but if you must, build 
a full protocol-compliant entity that just so happens to ship with and 
be co-resident in your firewall/nat. That entity must be directly 
addressed by other SIP entities, rather than being a transparent element 
in the network. It is only through this model that we can create robust 
and secure SIP networks.

Hi Folks,

If you are writing a draft using the xml2rfc tool, please make sure 
that the following line appears just after the line which begins <?rfc 
toc=

	<?rfc compact="yes"?>

if you don't do this, the tool will generate each top-level section on 
its own page, so you end up wasting a whole page to print for example:

	11. IANA Considerations

	   This document requires no action by IANA.

many thanks for saving trees, etc.. and making my reading list lighter 
(at least by weight).

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Folks,

A single, properly-paginated, suitable for double-sided printing, PDF 
file of the entire reading list for the SIP WGs upcoming meeting is now 
available on the supplemental website. Links are available from the 
agenda page:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/ietf59/agenda.html

There are actually 4 PDFs available.  You can select from PDFs for A4 
or US-Letter paper, and one-page per side or two-pages per side 
layouts.

Enjoy and see many of you in Korea.
thanks,
-rohan

Tom.

it seems that what you want is an update of the INFO spec, rather than 
fixing a few errata. I believe that we cannot meet your timeframe. In 
any event, it would be great we could start working on a solution for 
INFO in SIPPING, so that the ITU could reference it in the future.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

As a first step, I'll submit the Q.1912.5 annex as an I-D.  I expect we'll correct 
it to use UPDATE rather than BYE as the model in Geneva in the next couple of 
weeks, so what I submit will reflect that.

-Both To and From headers contain logical addresses. These headers are not
used for routing purposes.
-Contact header in general contains a SIP(S) URI for receiving subsequent
requests. However, this header is NOT used in PUBLISH and MESSAGE requests
as they do not expect any subsequent requests.

Please find a general guideline on these message headers and URI scheme
usage at

Hi Folks,

rfc3265 says

4.4.9. Handling of forked requests

   Each event package MUST specify whether forked SUBSCRIBE requests are
   allowed to install multiple subscriptions.

   If such behavior is not allowed, the first potential dialog-
   establishing message will create a dialog.  All subsequent NOTIFY
   messages which correspond to the SUBSCRIBE message (i.e., match "To",
   "From", "From" header "tag" parameter, "Call-ID", "CSeq", "Event",
   and "Event" header "id" parameter) but which do not match the dialog
   would be rejected with a 481 response.  Note that the 200-class
   response to the SUBSCRIBE can arrive after a matching NOTIFY has been
   received; such responses might not correlate to the same dialog
   established by the NOTIFY.  Except as required to complete the
   SUBSCRIBE transaction, such non-matching 200-class responses are
   ignored.


The question is, should the "CSeq" field of NOTIFY message participate in corresponding with SUBSCRIBE message?

Sure you can! Thats what callerprefs is for. You would define a new 
callee-caps parameter, "exposure" with values of east, west, north and 
south. The two devices would each include a +sip.exposure contact header 
field parmeter indicating which one is on which side. Then, a caller 
wanting to reach the east side would do this:

INVITE sip:fluffy@cisco.com
Accept-Contact: *;+sip.exposure="east"

which would do preferential routing to the east side.

Note, of course, that caller prefs provides no guarantees. Things still 
work if you fork the call to both. It is this unreliability for routing 
tha made it unsuitable for the problem of getting a request to a 
specific instance.

Right. The GRUU is not a device identifier. Its a URI whose property is=20

Correct. If a UA happens to be able to be able to generate a URI that it=20

Sounds like ISDN subaddresssing.

I think that this is a fair analogy to grid. I'm not sure I see cases=20
where it is useful to have the grid functionality separate from GRUUs.=20
Orit, can you give a specific example?

In section 6.1.5 of the sip-h323-interworking spec, there is a sentence:

"The IWF SHOULD be able to map the common audio, video and application
   format names supported in H.323 to and from the equivalent RTP/AVP
   [RFC3550] names."

It is good practice to always mention how the three main media of video,
audio and text shall be handled in real time applications.

audio and video are mentioned explicitly.

It may not be evident to everybody that real time interactive text is
capability declared in H.323 Annex G / H.245 by
DataApplicationCapability.application =3D t140

So, in fact it is covered in the sentence requiring that "application"
format namnes shall be mapped.

The mapping should correspond to the RTP/AVP  name text/t140 and
corresponding names for inclusion of protection against  loss.

I seek your guidance how it can be made more clear that "text" capabiliti=
es
can be expressed in both H.323 and SIP systems and should be mapped.

( the spec is at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-agrawal-sip-h323-interworking-r=
eqs
-06.txt )

The From does not have to contain anything useful at all. In general it
should have something that is more like the address of record for the user
instead of the the IP address and port that can be used to reach the device=
.
The contact is used to reach the device. So mine mike look like

From: =B3Cullen Jennings=B2 <sip:fluffy@cisco.com>

If the only way to reach the proxy was on port 1234 then I might have to
include that in my AOR but I would usually not put the port that the UA was
using in the from.=20

If the only way to reach the proxy was on port 1234 then I might have to in=

This just pushes the problem around but does not solve it. When both the
phone boot, how do they know if they registers with the exposure set to east
or west? We need something that makes one phone different from the other
phone and configuration does not really help much because when the phones
first boot they have no configuration.

we are already discussing this in *SIP*, not in *SIPPING*. What I am

Keith,

OK, I re-read the thread and I have noticed that you were referencing my 
last email. What I actually meant was that we should see whether we 
deprecate INFO so that it only transports PSTN stuff, or, on the other 
hand, we define INFO packages. We had some discussions about that some 
time ago.

So, we need to discuss which requirements we need to fulfill, and that 
should be done in SIPPING. The actual document updating INFO will be 
done in SIP, as you suggest.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

In section 4.3.3.1, the draft states "The index for this entry is =
RECOMMENDED to start at 1."

On the one hand, why would the first proxy start at anything other than =
1?

On the other hand, I could see doing it for debugging purposes: I set =
proxy A to start at 1000 and proxy B to start at 100000, and then I get =
an extra level of (non-interoperable, but yet still useful for debugging =
purposes) history information.

I would either state some reasons why it is only recommended (or =
should), or make it a must.  Personally, I like debugging stuff, so I =
would leave it as is.

rjs: I would also plan on a torture test where a proxy receives a =
message with a history-info index of, say, 32767 :-)

Its late, I'm tired, so there is a good chance that what I am saying 
below makes no sense.

It occurs to me that there is another solution (and I dont recall if we 
discussed it), which can alleviate many of the problems in the problems 
draft. The idea is that we define two separate NIT timeouts - one for a 
client or proxy, and one for a server that generates its own responses 
(as opposed to forwarding ones generated by others). The server one is 
1/2 the size of the client one. We could, for example, keep the client 
one at 32 and make the server one 16.

In this case, a UAS would HAVE to send a 408 if it cant complete the 
transaction in 16s. However, this 408 will not arrive too late at any 
upstream elements, since all of them have still 16s remaining.

AFAICT, this approach has the following impacts on the problems in your 
problems draft:

1.1 is solved. You reply immediately, if not, a UAS has to reply within 
16s with a 408. The race then becomes possibly if it takes 16 for the 
response to propagate - if thats a problem, then the noninvite 
transaction duration itself is too small for that network.

1.2 is not solved. I see this is quite separate from the other problems. 
TCP does solve it tho.

1.3 is solved. You should get a response now before the transaction 
completes.

1.4 is solved. 408 is still useful. Its always sent by the uas before 
the upstream transactions terminate.

1.5 is sort of solved, but not completely. If an element has failed, 
you'll not get a 408 at all, so the proxy still waits too long to get a 
response from the failed element. Need to think about that some more.

1.6 is still a problem; thats fundamentally unsolvable without some kind 
of negotiation or mandatory minimum.


This is, to some degree, a vairation on the Timeleft approach in your 
futures draft.

That's a good point;  I honestly can't remember if there was a specific
reason why we had a RECOMMENDED rather than a MUST.  But,  I don't think it
would necessarily cause interoperability problems, it just would make it a
bit more difficult for the end applications to handle as they would likely
have to normalize the indices back to 1 (I can't see the value in an
application in wanting to use or know that different proxies might start at
different indices and that certainly wasn't the intent).  So, unless someone
has a compelling reason why we should keep it as RECOMMENDED, I'll make the
change to MUST in the next rev.

Mary.

Subject: sip-history-info-02: counter starter


In section 4.3.3.1, the draft states "The index for this entry is
RECOMMENDED to start at 1."

On the one hand, why would the first proxy start at anything other than 1?

On the other hand, I could see doing it for debugging purposes: I set proxy
A to start at 1000 and proxy B to start at 100000, and then I get an extra
level of (non-interoperable, but yet still useful for debugging purposes)
history information.

I would either state some reasons why it is only recommended (or should), or
make it a must.  Personally, I like debugging stuff, so I would leave it as
is.

rjs: I would also plan on a torture test where a proxy receives a message
with a history-info index of, say, 32767 :-)

At least one possible use case is for location updates during emergency 
calls. I'll discuss this option during the relevant SIPPING segment. (At 
this point, I'm not arguing that this is how it should be done, just 
that it as a plausible option.)
