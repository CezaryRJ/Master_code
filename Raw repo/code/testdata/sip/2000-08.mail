I've readh through the 3pcc draft, and find that there is one
characteristic missing.  The second example (click-to-dial) assumes
sount out-of-band mechanism for a user to initiate a call using the
3pcc (in the example it was some HTTP application).  I'll quote:

   We assume for purposes of this discussion that the web server is             
   actually an applications server that contains an http interface. In          
   this case, when the user clicks on the URL, the application server           
   knows, through cookies or some other state mechanism, the addresses          
   of the participants to be connected.

How is this done using SIP?  I want UserA to send an INVITE to a 3pcc, 
to which it will send an INVITE to UserB.  This is why I wanted a
proxy.  A proxy will do exactly that.  However, I need some timing
capabilities (such as a calling card that is time limited).  This
means that the "man in the middle" will need to hang up.  An ideal
solution for me would be for the proxy to hang up.  Perhaps what I
need it to signal the UA that it should hang up, and then the end UA
will send the BYE, instead of the proxy.  This will require an
extension to SIP.

I think that for many QoS and similar applications, this issue should
be address more cleanly.

Suppose a proxy controls a firewall to open or close ports for the
RTP.  For some reason the proxy decides that this call should no
longer pass through the firewall.  A nice solution would have been for 
the proxy to somehow initiate the teardown of the call.  The tools
that the RFC provide seem to point to simply closing the RTP and
letting ICMP notify the parties that they can't be reached.

Am I missing something?

there was a long discussion on this a couple of weeks back.  i will not
go over all of the arguments, for and against, yet again, but point you
in the direction of the archives instead (thread name is: "SIP URL
telephone-subscriber syntax").  If after reading these, you still
disagree with the forum's consensus then please raise this issue again
with your new objections.

no, this is not ambiguous.  ; is allowed in user so the user is a;b=c 
this is black and white there is no ambiguity via the greedy parsing
algorithm.  if you wanted the former, then the url should look like:

sip:a;b=c%40d

It is the case that any character that incorrectly changes the
semantics of URI's MUST be escaped.  that is all that is happening
here.  It is suggested that @ is always escaped in parameters. even if
this is not required for example:

a@b;c@d

is user "a" host "b" param "c@d" but it is suggested to even make the
parameter here "c%40d".  mainly because this will make development
easier :)

> Am I missing something ?

perhaps this has made parsing sip url's slightly more difficult but
this is considered better than double escaping of characters or
defining new escaping techniques to enable the encapsulation of the tel
url in the user.

Unfortunately Gethin, that's not true as the draft currently stands (July).
'@' doesn't need to be escaped when it appears in a paramter name or value.

Jonathan and Henning were discussing changing the draft in this respect but
I never saw any concrete conclusion reached.

I am uncertain as to whether you understood my point so I will give an
example.

SDP A
c=IN IP4 10.0.0.1
m=audio 6000 RTP/AVP 0

SDP B
c=IN IP4 10.0.0.2
m=audio 7000 RTP/AVP 0

This does not infer that B must send packets with a source port of 7000 or
that A must send packets with a source port of 6000 (if my understanding of
SDP is correct - please correct me if I'm wrong).

In your TCP model, must a TCP connection connection use a source port equal
to the destination of the remote node ? If so, isn't this going against the
spirit of the SDP spec ?

Robert.

Just as an afterthought regarding my previous query, what happens if a 
proxy fails to proxy an ACK? 

(Note:  This is perhaps similary to another example posted on the list 
when a proxy discovers that to send the ACK it will have to loop.   
My question is a bit more general)

When I asked what should a UAS do when it sent a 200 response without
receiving an ACK, I was replied that it should die quietly.  Now, if
the proxy failed to send the ACK (for the 200), then the UAS will die
quietly, and the UAC, will think it sent a perfectly good ACK.

The proxy knows that it cannot send the ACK, however it cannot
inform the UAC that the ACK failed, without initiating a BYE.

This is a somewhat simpler situation of a proxy initiating a BYE since 
it only sends the BYE one direction - but this is exactly the
direction that is problematic.  Besides, the issue is whether the
proxy should send the BYE or not.

you are correct that @ does not HAVE to be escaped in the majority of
situations (as i said previously), but where it changes the semantics of
the sip url, i.e. changes what is host and what is not, then by
implication it MUST.

then we will wait for them to confirm or disagree when they come on-line
later in the day.

If it's because the proxy is inherently incabable, you buy a
new proxy from a different vendor.

Otherwise, it's going to be some horrible network failure, I guess;
well, these things happen.

I can't understand why a proxy would ever find out that it had
to loop an ACK, if it's going by the bis draft (mandating Contact
has effectively eliminated this as a problem).

The only case, then, that a proxy would "discover" that it had
to loop an ACK would be if one or both of the UAs were dain-bramaged
and inserting incorrect Contact addresses; or perhaps even
a proxy inserting an incorrect Record-Route.

It's difficult to legislate against a broken implementation if
the vendor went at it with a sledgehammer. &:)

This is trivially solved by magic of Session Timer.

And even if Session Timer is not being used, I would guess that
the callee is eventually going to figure that something is wrong.
If the 'phone rings, and I pick it up, and all I hear is dead
air, I'm going to put the 'phone back down.

There's nothing wrong with the UAS sending a BYE.  The point was that
it might not necessarily work because the reason you didn't see
an ACK was because all the 200s were getting lost.  If all the
200s are getting losts, a BYE isn't likely to do any better.

> This is a somewhat simpler situation of a proxy initiating a BYE since

Ultimately, I think we're getting down to the notion of logical
roles.  In the end, all of these things: UAC, UAS, stateful proxy,
yada, yada, are logical roles.  A proxy doesn't initiate requests
(other than ACK or CANCEL), period.  This doesn't mean that you
can't have some sort of hybrid server that appears (to other
elements in the "SIP Network") like a UAC in some scenarios, and
like a proxy in others.

However, in this case, I would consider such an approach
unnecessary in the face of Session Timer.  It is easy for a proxy
along the route to mandate the use of Session Timer, which seems
to solve all problems.  And if you want to solve other problems,
best to look to more "standard" ways such as 3pcc, first.

Cheers,


 - Jo.

Yes, thank you, I was not entirely clear on your point.

I don't know for sure whether your assertion is true or false.  I don't see 
why a UA *wouldn't* source packets from the port number it advertised, it 
certainly seems like that would make things cleaner.  I suppose NATs throw 
in a wrench, but there again I don't see why a SIP ALP on NAT wouldn't be 
able to open up a port binding using the same WAN port for both 
directions.  But yes, I've never read anything that says sourcing packets 
from the destination port is a requirement.

As far as a TCP connection using "a source port equal to the destination of 
the remote node", well, by definition this is what TCP connections 
do!  When a TCP connection is set up, it is defined by a four-tuple, and 
all communication is between two IP addresses and exactly two port 
numbers.  So if you are receiving packets on port 4399, you will also be 
sending packets from 4399, there's no way around it.

The only additional requirement I'm proposing---and as I mentioned in an 
earlier message, maybe it's not a requirement in all topologies---is that 
the initiator of the connection announce the port number of that endpoint 
prior to doing the connect for the purpose of identification.  This is 
definitely in the spirit of SDP, which does not require that the media 
stream contain an inline mechanism to identify the session.  Rather, the 
session is identified in external signaling (SIP), and the four-tuple of 
the RTP is how a UA maps a media stream to a SIP session.

This is not something for the proxy to worry about. The session is being
setup end-to-end and proxies cannot and should not tear down or
otherwise modify an ongoing session.  If you need that sort of
functionality then you're nto looking at a proxy but at something that
acts as a combined back-to-back UAS and UAC - the B2BUA Jonathan talked
about. This is what the 3pcc draft is about.

As Gethin pointed out session timers or broken media streams may be used
by the UAC to detect a situation like the one you describe and take
whatever action is appropriate, e.g. attempting to send a BYE.

I think what you are refering to is some sort of a SIP Controller
(Application Server with parlay interface, for example) that would have UA
capabilities (actually, it would have to be a UA).  As Jonathan said, proxies
don't initiate requests.

The SIP controller would have a timer and send BYEs to both parties once the
timer has expired.

If you are tallking about a SIP Proxy, then I believe what you have described
above is not a function of it.

Hi,

As I understand, and please correct me if I'm wrong,  your sipd server only uses
the LDAP server when your local DB fails to return any info about the callee.
What we want to is use the LDAP server as our location server for REGISTER
requests and retrieval (as you said, a backend for a registrar).

I know that LDAP is more used for long term location info and doesn't fit nicely
in a rapidly changing location info (a lot of writes as well as reads), but we
are willing to experiment anyway.

Do you think its worth the effort in defining a schema for SIP?

Much appreciated
Hisham

I would see this more as an extension of an existing (person) schema
than something completely new.

This is not the case - how could you distinguish two connections from one
machine to one service on a well known port on another machine? The source
and destination ports are usually different.

Example:

Connection web page request from 128.0.0.1 to 128.0.0.2

Packets from 128.0.0.1 have source address 128.0.0.1, port 1234, destination
address 128.0.0.2, port 80.
Packets sent back in reply have source address 128.0.0.2, port 80,
destination address 128.0.0.1, port 1234.

Simon Barber

Simon, you are absolutely right. An endpoint in TCP is (IP addr, port) and a
pair of end-points make up a TCP connection. So even if one end-point is common
as is typical with web servers (131.96.1.4, 80), but since the other end-points
are all different, these denote all different TCP connections. In fact that is
how TCP keeps track of where to send data based on active connections it is
maintaining. I also think that since the client end-point does an active
connect, the local source port is dynamically obtained from the O/S and bound to
the other side (server) of the end-point. Full duplex data can now flow both
ways through this connection. I am not sure why media client in UA has to notify
the source port to the media server in UA. Connection should take care of it.

No, no, no, no, no.  I was *not* contradicting this (amazing how hard it is 
to communicate such a simple thing).  Look at what I said:

" So if you are receiving packets on port 4399, you will also be sending 
packets *from* 4399. " (emphasis added)

Look at what you said:

" Packets sent back in reply have source address 128.0.0.2, port 80, 
destination address 128.0.0.1, port 1234. "

These two statements are not at odds with each other.  Mine is a bit less 
complete, but I figured what I left out goes without saying. 
:-)  Substituting your port example into my phrasing:

" So if you are receiving packets on port 80, you will also be sending 
packets from 80. "

This is TRUE.  If you have a connection on port 80 (local) to port 1234 
(remote), any outbound packet (from local to remote) WILL HAVE A SOURCE 
PORT OF 80, so "you will also be sending packets from 80".  So yes, we're 
in violent agreement.

After rereading my post, I see that in my zeal to be understood, I may have 
come across as inflammatory.  This was unintentional and I should have 
submitted the posting after another proofreading.  No offense was intended.

After going through the earlier discussion pointed to by Gethin,

Is this correct ?

I agree. I don't believe that the @ should just be escaped when it causes an
ambiguity (as determined by the generating SIP implementation) but rather
should always be escaped when it appears in the parameters or URL headers.
Simpler is better, right ? I think this is the point we didn't get concrete
resolution on last time.
 
Robert.

The current version reads:

  hname           = 1*( hnv-unreserved | unreserved | escaped )
  hvalue          = *( hnv-unreserved | unreserved | escaped )
  hnv-unreserved  = "[" | "]" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "+" | "$"

Thus, @ MUST be escaped (if it doesn't have syntax significance). It is
also listed as a separator.

Hello!
Before the 9 experts start their work, I suggest to slice things =
slightly different.
This is in order to be able "to compare" the different protocols in a =
more efficient way.

We all (providers and users) have the vision of the future "Converged =
Communication Network".
Voice, Video, IM, Presence, Mail are all different services in this =
envisioned infrastructure.

Each of these Services has (slightly) different "Session" (or "Call =
Signaling") requirements.
This "Session" piece is the smaller part of the whole "Communication =
Infrastructure" puzzle.

The crucial and the more sophisticated part of the desired "Converged =
Network", is the User definition and User's interface with the =
"Converged Network". Only a definition of a common "User" concept across =
the Services will make the Convergence real.
-    This "User" part is NOT Session (or "Call") related
-    This "User" part includes (among others) Mobility ( achieved by a =
Subscription/Registration concept) and the User Identification =
functions.

Today, SIP defines things beyond "Session" establishment, i.e. Sip =
defines both the "User" and the "Session" parts of the puzzle.

Based on all this, I suggest to slice the problem into the two "User" =
and "Session" questions below:

(1) What is the solution for the "User" part of the puzzle? Would we =
like to adopt SIP's solution as the solution for the converged networks? =
Do we need to expand it? Would we like introduce/reuse something =
different?
(2) What is the solution for the different kinds of "Sessions" =
establishment? SIP definitely addresses "voice sessions". SMTP =
definitely addresses "mail sessions".
For the sessions of other nature, it can be either SIP extended =
version(s) or another specific protocols. Being able to resolve the =
"User" issues, the Session part of the puzzle becomes invisible to the =
user, much smaller, simpler (and therefore the solution itself is less =
crucial).

I generally agree with your assessment of user vs. session issues - 
in particular the need to have a common naming infrastructure
to make cross-service integration work.  The trick is to make this
infrastructure one which will handle the needs of the several
services that one might want integrated under a common namespace.
(and without favoring certain kinds of service providers over others)

Keith I think this question was ruled out of scope by popular acclimation 
in the WG discussion.

Hi all,

In section 1.4.5 in the July 13 bis draft, its says:

"...A proxy server MUST check that it does not generate a request to a
host listed in the Via sent-by, via-received or via-maddr parameters.."

Is this still true with the new legal loop detection?  As we know now,
it is legal to forward a request to a proxy that is already in the via
list.  It is up to that proxy to decide if this request has been looped
to it legally or not. So, should this text be changed, or ever removed?

Thanks,
Hisham Khartabil

Subject: [SIP] SIP-T Draft Feedback


Comments about draft-vemuri-sip-t-context-00.txt:

- On page 5, the point about "PSTN origination"
  should make mention that some ISUP modifications
  may occur to sync up with changes made by SIP
  proxies in the SIP network.

[AV]:
I think you refer to the changes that might be made to
bring the ISUP in line with the SIP messaging that 
encompasses it.  I believe that the SIP headers will be in 
tune with the ISUP at the ingress MGC that performs the 
translation between the two. The SIP headers could 
subsequently undergo modification  that would then 
result in a conflict between the SIP and ISUP. 

I am not sure if it is appropriate to explain this with the
'PSTN origination' point. We do touch upon this later (in 
section 6.2, to be precise) and I think we could re-phrase
or re-position this in order for this to be more suitable.



- In the call flows, you tend to map ACM messages
  to "183 Session Progress." In practice, ACMs
  typically have indication of "Subscriber
  free," which *should* map to "180 Ringing."
  Admittely, you don't have any ISUP parameters
  detailed in the call flows, but I think you
  shouldn't be using the exceptional cases to
  illustrate call flows.

 .....OK.

- On page 10, there's a minor cut and paste error
  where the final BYE response is listed as BYE.

[AV]:
 This will be corrected.

- Also in the call flow in page 10, note that
  the 200 response for BYE is used only for
  reliability; in ISUP, the RLC is used to
  indicate that a circuit is available for re-use.
  In most circumstances, it doesn't make sense
  to hold off the 200 response to the BYE
  until the RLC arrives.

[AV]:
Thanks for pointing this out. This will be rectified.


- On page 14: I just want to bring your attention
  to the fact that much of the header mapping
  is already present in Gonzalo's and my draft.

[AV]:
It would be nice if we could talk about this some more.


- Also on page 14: it should be mentioned that
  encryption should be used for ISUP bodies.

[AV]:
I think we should study the ramifications of doing 
this some more along with determining what the 
regulatory issues concerning ISUP are.

I do not think end-to-end encryption will work, 
essentially because the originating MGC may not
know where the call may terminate, and usage
of hop-by-hop encryption (and consequent removal
or modification of ISUP) could require the proxies to
examine the bodies. Another option, I think, would
be to have an error message generated when the call
hits a 'non-encrypted hop' and to have the originator
resend the INVITE with the appropriate 
modifications.....
I think a few  such options  were put forth in a 
discussion on the list before.

Our thoughts were that this kind of situation would be 
averted if a network managed the registration of 
end-points and enforced trust relationships and policy
with users. Network edges could employ means to strip 
off the ISUP where necessary...

All in all, this is something that needs some 
more work.


- Section 6.2: It seems a bit odd to have a special
  purpose application server "fixing" the ISUP
  before it goes to the egress gateway. Since this
  gateway is already having to unpack the ISUP and
  (to some degree) understand it, it makes the
  most sense to perform that function in the MGC.

[AV]:
Our intention was NOT to mandate that an AS (Appln. 
Server) be used to do this job. We were only trying to 
make a suggestion that an AS may be used for this purpose. 
There may be multiple ways to do this. The text may need 
to be re-phrased accordingly.


- On note 9: in Gonzalo's and My draft, we specify
  that any informationthat shouldn't be presented
  also shouldn't be mapped into SIP headers.
  I beleive this is a non-issue, as long as the
  ISUP bodies are encrypted.

[AV]:
 I think that will be the case as long as the 
information is not mandatory for SIP. Specifically, 
(as far as note 9 goes) I do not think that the 
'userinfo' part (of userinfo@host) is required in 
the SIP 'From'. This (the note) may need to be pulled 
out.

Comments, Adam, Jon, SIP WG?

Thanks for the good work!

[AV]:
Thank you!
Aparna

It was ruled out of scope for the meeting, by the meeting attendees.  The
meeting is not the WG.

Can this mailing list please stay focused on what is specified in the 
charter of the wg, and let the wg chairs and myself take care of the 
process.

Thank you.

Hi,

Just wanted to clarify this, since you didn't include syntax, that the
original contents of the Session header (qos, security, media) would become
parameters to the session disposition?  and you could add one or more of
these session "purposes"?

Example using manyfolks qos and security:

	180 Ringing
	...
	Content-type: application/sdp
	Content-disposition: session;qos;security;handling=required
	Content-Length: ...
	...
	a=qos: mandatory sendrecv confirm
	a=security: optional sendrecv confirm

Old Syntax:

Content-Disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":" disposition-type *(";"
disposition-parm)
disposition-type = "render" | "session" | extension-token
disposition-parm = handling-parm | parameter
handling-parm = "handling" "=" ( "optional" | "required" | other-handling )
other-handling = token

New Sytax:

Content-Disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":" disposition-type *(";"
disposition-parm)
disposition-type = "render" | "session" | extension-token
disposition-parm = handling-parm | session-parm | parameter
handling-parm = "handling" "=" ( "optional" | "required" | other-handling )
other-handling = token
session-parm = "qos" | "security" | "media" | token

session-parm is only valid with the "session" disposition-type.

Is this the idea?

thanks,
-rohan

Yes,

I agree.  That's also how I envision the feature working.  I just used
park-12, because I wanted to focus Hong on the call flows first.

I'm not sure it is necessary to specify QoS and Security.  The real need for
the additional parameter in the content-disposition header (the old session
header) is to indicate that the message body contains preconditions.  The
indication of preconditions tells the SIP state machine to delay alerting
the user until the preconditions have been met.

Specifying QoS and Security as reasons for the preconditions means that the
protocol will need to be changed with other precondition reasons need to be
added.

In addition, QoS and Security would only need to be included in the header
when the SDP strength-tag is mandatory.  There is no value to the SIP state
machine to know that there are QoS attributes in the SDP when the
strength-tag is set to optional.

I would suggest a parameter that is something like:

Content-Disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":" disposition-type *(";"
  disposition-parm)
disposition-type = "render" | "session" | extension-token
disposition-parm = handling-parm | session-parm | parameter
handling-parm = "handling" "=" ( "optional" | "required" |
other-handling )
other-handling = token
session-parm = "preconditions" | "media" | token

Where presence of the preconditions session-parm indicates that
preconditions exist.

Agreed. The purpose of the tag in the content-disposition header is to
indicate when 
some aspect of the session described by the content impacts the
operation of sip. As
the operation does not depend on whether the precondition itself is qos
or security,
a single tag should suffice. In fact, perhaps we should call it
"precondition"?

The old Session header could indicate if the session description was to be
used for media, or for setting up qos or security.  Perhaps we could have:

disposition-type = "render" | "media" | "session-info" | extension-type

media would correspond to ordinary or early media, and session-info or
"precondition" would be a session used for setting up qos, security, nat
traversal, punching holes in firewalls, etc...

the only problem is that there a few valid scenarios where you might want
to use a session description for both early media and qos.

that's the way manyfolks is defined now.

[The following is written in haste, because I discovered I have to take an
early plane out of the IETF. I'm really sorry to miss the BOF tonight, but
I'll certainly answer email questions:]

I tried hard to do what Dave Crocker suggested, and thought about what the
'other side' is really after, and the fact is that once I put myself in
this frame of mind, I came pretty quickly to a few ideas that point to a
compromise. I know that this is considered impossible, and that many
people are just waiting for the two weeks to pass so that the group can
split in two, but I hope you'll give the following ideas a decent
look-over. I'll state up front that I am guilty of two things: I am from
the SIP side of the house, and I have not been as active on the list as I
should have been. But I spoke to a few people yesterday, and I believe
that the following is new input. If not, I apologize.

First, Dave Crocker's exercise: what does each side bring to the table,
beyond "take my protocol, please...."

The really essential service that SIP offers is 'session initiation'. It
was absoutely designed from the beginning as a way to HAND OFF to another
protocol. SIP is only one piece in a puzzle that includes SDP (for
describing voice/video sessions) and RTP (for transmitting realtime data).
The original intent was that SIP would hand off to the actual media
transport session as soon as possible
(an RTP session in the case of realtime voice/video). In fact, basic SIP
(without extensions) does a relatively poor job of managing or modifying
sessions that already exist. 

The key thing to remember from all this is that SIP is 
crafted to allow the sort of "finding"/"signaling" and "hand off to
another protocol". It is designed to do this under some very important and
difficult conditions -- mainly when people and terminals are moving
around, and when it's not clear at the beginning the people want to IM.
What SIP is less designed to do is to pass around crazy types of
text and non-text instant messages (although of course SIP can do
*anything* ;-)) that have nothing to do with a later hand-off to a
multimedia session.

Now, on the other hand, my understanding is that the "messaging" people
feel that the key elements of MIME and SMTP push are very important to
them. In fact, my understanding is that the 'mobility rendez-vous parts'
of IMXP are less established and tested yet than various nooks and
crannies of the problems of getting a message reliably and quickly from A
to B.

I for one think it very reasonable to suppose that people who have been
thinking about how to do messaging for many years are very good at their
craft, and have thought a lot about the nooks and crannies of the
different horrors that might occur when trying to transport "instantly"
different types of "messages". Maybe they've even thought more than the
SIP people have about this ;-). I'm particularly thinking about what will
happen when the message is large (a big image or large HTML message, etc.)

So my proposal for compromise is the following:

use SIP for rendezvous and distributing presence -- find the other
person/people, help decide that the *way* they want to communicate is via
IM, and then HAND OFF to an IM protocol, one that is designed to be
extensible to all kinds of instant messaging (large gifs, powerpoint
presentations, shared browsing, whatever, etc.).

If IMXP is a better "IM transfer protocol", then it's very
reasonable to leave it to do just that, and have a user signal that
he wants to IM you by having the SIP hand off to IM. 

I'm hoping (probably in vain) that what really offends the SIP people is
doing finding/rendezvous in some other protocol than SIP, and that what
really offends messaging people is using SIP to transfer messages.

To be honest, this already happens in one very special kind of instant
messaging -- people who are into telephone devices for the deaf (TDD) have
defined an RTP format for realtime delivery of text. If you've ever seen a
device like this, it is the original "instant messaging device". It
enables people who could not otherwise use a phone to communicate over the
phone. And in the SIP version of this service, SIP is used to 'set
up' the call, but soon enough the call is handed off to RTP, using the
special RTP format for these kinds of text messages. NO NO NO -- I'm not
suggesting that we do instant messaging this way. I'm suggesting that this
model -- where SIP rendez-vous and hands off to a different protocol -- is
the core SIP model, and already is used for a very special kind of
"instant messaging". SIP really does this "find/rendezvous/hand-off"
piece very well, and it would be silly to reinvent it.

At this point, I think that it's worth saying that the accusations about
"SIP taking over the user" are really not true. There are many many things
that one might want to do with a user which have nothing to do with
communicating with her/him. I might want to configure the user's computer
(if I'm the sysadmin), I might want to send mail to his telephone,
whatever. SIP has indeed been designed for the
particular issue of "I've got a user name, and I want to do realtime
communication with him". SIP is not intended to 'own the user'. *That* is
a directory problem, and SIP is NOT a directory service, nor was it ever
intended to be one.

As a final comment (I'm sure I'm gonna regret saying this), it does look
as if IMXP is a less mature protocol, in the good old IETF sense of
multiple interoperable implementations. (remember "running code". That was
supposed to carry some weight). So for the really stupid requirement to
send a short piece of text from one host to another, the MESSAGE method 
works just fine. This could be used as a stop gap while the more elaborate
IMXP details are being worked out. There are many details still to be
worked out in the SIP proposals for rendezvous and presence. But they
really are details, and I'll bet that this work could be completed
quickly, to be followed by completing the work on finishing details of
IMXP for instant message delivery.

Scott

I have a general comment on the "Networked Appliances" draft.

It seems to me that SIP is not an appropriate protocol for this purpose. It
falls into the category of using SIP for an RPC mechanism. It is not clear
to me how the primary features that distinguish SIP from something like HTTP
(finding location, mobility, etc) are needed for a networked appliance
protocol.

It is entirely possible I am missing something here. If so, please enlighten
me.

Thanks!

I was trying to avoid coping the contents of the SDP body into the SIP
headers.  Why does the SIP UA need to know that there are QoS, security or
other precondition information in the header?

The manyfolks draft defines it in the SDP, which is appropriate.  I don't
think it talks about the SIP Session header.  I'm arguing that the SIP layer
does not need to know about QoS or Security, only that preconditions exist.

I don't see this as RPC in the classical sense. There are two aspects:

- action (MESSAGE) to affect lightbulb state;'

- events to obtain lightbulb state.

Thus, this is very similar to sending text (chat) messages and
subscribing to user status changes (events). Particularly in the event
case, the usual SIP advantages apply, including that the watcher may be
mobile (Speaking from personal plumbing accident experience, I want to
be notified when the home temperature drops below threshold regardless
of my location).

There are some nice secondary benefits to this: existing SIP message and
notification tools can be trivially extended to handle this. I can put
my washer in my address book and be notified when the wash is ready.

Also, existing tools such as sip-cgi and CPL are quite useful for this
space.

Since this doesn't require any SIP extensions, it seems (hopefully)
harmless.

It seems that this and other discussions of subscribe/notify and message, we
are moving towards a general event mechanism, i.e. application to
application communication, not necessarily human to human communication. I
am agnostic on whether this is a good or bad thing, but I am surprised it
does not generate more controversy. Perhaps this should come up at the event
mechanism BOF tonight.

Not to be pedantic, but while it may not _introduce_ any new extensions, it
certainly does require a them. Again, perhaps we need to clarify the
intended purpose of the presence and messaging extension proposals.

The temptation to extend or use the "message" capability of SIP may become a
problem for all SIP devices to represent the message to the user. I would
think it far more compatible to start a SIP session and initiate a RTP audio
stream to deliver the audio message "FYI the house is too cold, the windows
are open, and it is snowing inside." when you are contacted via a SIP PSTN
gateway at your hotel in sunny Jamaica. And to deliver the message as text
to your pager, if instead you were hiking in the Rockies. It seems that with
SDP this is already worked out by the session UAs, where as the message
scheme requires the destination UA to provide "message translation" so that
the message can be presented to the user by the interface device. I think
the logic of session initiation consistently extends to initiating device
control and RPC protocols with SIP, rather than putting these into SIP.

>I don't see this as RPC in the classical sense. There are two aspects:

I think the statement 'SIP is not for RPC' as a guideline
to using/extending SIP is not sufficiently qualified.
SIP is certainly not a high efficiency or general purpose
RPC mechanism but some things which could be interpreted
as RPC-like might still be valid uses for SIP.

One thing that is not clear to me is the relationship between
what is referred to as a service provider proxy and home
domain proxy with respect to REGISTERs/message routing. In
the simple access from home to work example the draft refers
to a UA in the home domain registering with the home domain
proxy and this information being propagated to the service
provider's domain. Without that occurring I can't see the message
routing between the two proxies in the subsequent call flow
working. Unfortunately there is no mechanism in SIP for this
propagation. So either the two proxies have another non SIP
based relationship between them or SIP would need extending
to accommodate such a mechanism.

Cheers,
Neil.

Since most any protocol, including HTTP and SMTP (or RTP and SNMP), can
be replaced by RPC in some sense (and thus serves as an RPC mechanism),
the statement probably does need to be qualified.

That's actually a more general problem, I believe. In some cases
(mobility), it would be nice to proxy a REGISTER to the provider, yet
have the proxy "remember" this registration.

Hi Folks,

Below is a summary of one proposal for DTMF (basically what I said at the
mic today).

- Terminals which *send audio* must be able to send and receive DTMF via
RTP.  (If for no other reason, than PSTN interworking).

- First-party applications which *receive audio*, must be able to receive
DTMF via RTP, because the sender may send their DTMF over RTP.

- Third-party applications which want to find out about keypresses (IP
endpoints) or DTMF events (PSTN endpoints) of a party in a call, should
send a SUBSCRIBE to that party for dtmf-events.  The third party may
request [using some kind of parameter (ex: ";silent" or ";private")]  that
DTMF is not sent via RTP during this subscription.  Otherwise the first
party still sends DTMF to its audio peers using RTP.

Applications of the "silent" parameter would be private signalling to
calling card things, to conference control services, etc.

- Alternatively a third party MAY send a script/document/application (ex:
VoXML doc) to an endpoint to run, which could result in other SIP
messages//notifies, etc.  This script/doc/app MAY trap DTMF locally (and
silently).

- A first-party MAY NOT subscribe to dtmf-events, but MAY trap DTMF based
on a local script/app/doc.

Key here was the difference between a first party participant and a third
party participant.

Thoughts?

thanks,
-rohan

It's already been announced multiple times,
but we appear to have so much traffic on the
list that it's being overlooked by many.

We have a mailing list set up for discussion of
events (i.e. SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY).

To join, go to
http://www.egroups.com/messages/sip-events

After some editing, I will shortly be posting
some abbreviated minutes of the evening BOF
on events, as well as our plan for moving
forward.

The web page includes a mail archive, so you
can catch up on the list (it's had 6 messages
so far).

I have presented the TIPHON architecture and QoS work at a fairly high-level
way to the SIP working group and the MMUSIC WG.

Both presentations can be found at:
  http://pages.hotbot.com/edu/sijben/

The SIP presentation resulted in no feedback during the meeting but some
positive feedback off-line.

The SDP presentation did go very bad. I got shot down (by Jonathan Rosenberg,
Henning Shulzerinne, Christian Huitema and others.) over the basic premise
that signaling is related to the media so that the signaling path can say
sensible things about the QoS.
This was deemed against the philosophy of the Internet. Quote: "No internet I
have seen works like this". It was claimed that the opposite is true because
the signaling and the media go over completely different paths.

The attackers seemed to see in the presentation that TIPHON wants to do a
link-by-link replacement of the switched networks... Saying that this is not
the case had no effect.

A reply along the lines of that QoS implies commercial relationships and than
media gateways impact QoS and are controlled by the applications and hence
that the applications have impact on QoS did also not sway the die-hards.
(Someone actually claimed that the MG is not controlled by the application
domain ?????)

After the session was over someone working on MPEG-4 said that he heard
something else in my presentation namely exactly what they are have been
doing! So I pointed him to our documents because he described the same method
we have been exploring in WG5 but they need the parameter values. I told him
to look at 5003 and 5009. So the session was not a complete loss and we are
not the only ones looking at this.

Folks,
Although this is an SDP problem, it seems the interpretation of it by
*many* SIP implementors of the t= line in SDP is taken differently from
what the SDP grammar *explicitly* states.

According to the grammar:

t= <start time> <stop>

start- time  = time | "0"

time = POS-DIGIT 9*(DIGIT)

If my interpretation is correct, the above specifies at least a 10 digit t=
value (or 0)

SDP afaik, is known not to be lenient (unlike SIP headers) and hence any
divergence from SDP grammar should be an error.

My question is: Is the grammar above of SDP (and its interpretation of it)
correct , and do the sip implementors need to
be aware not to stuff in < 10 digit values in t= field (except 0)

Regds
Arjun

Hi : 
       In the RFC2543, there mentioned that A location server may use one or
more other protocols to determine the end system where a user might be
reachable, and return the several locations to SIP server. but I have three
questions: 
      A. Which location server does the SIP server contact with? Does the
SIP server contact with one or more location server? 
      B. How does the location server return a User address ? Is it a
address of the User's or a SIP server's?  
      C. If the location server always return more addresses of a User's
because it might be reachable, then the SIP server also to contact with more
addresses in order to find a user, it lead to waste the resourse and find
user slow, is it a big problem using SIP?  
       Does anyone give a answer ? thanks very much !

Rohan,

Is eliminating a first party from subscribing to DTMF event too restrictive?
I say this because I'd like to have the choice of either SUBSCRIBE or RFC
2833 (DTMF in RTP) as a first party.  (I assume that by "first party" you
mean an endpoint with both a signaling session and a media session with the
other endpoint).  You imply the other endpoint will support both sending
DTMF events by NOTIFY and in RTP, maybe that's my interpretation problem :).
I believe a SIP UA can be a "first party" initially in a call then become a
"third party" by redirecting the other UA's media.  Maybe I just need to
understand the terms first and third party.

Thanks,
Bert

Hi,

    I would like to add in this context that once the instant messaging is in place, can it be used
for sending static images in SIP?  This pertains to the earlier issue on sending a variable bitrate,
low frame rate video in parallel with the existing session. Whenever an entity wants to send a frame
to the other end it merely sends a notification message with the body containing the jpeg image.

    I have a doubt regarding whether RPC mechanism can be used for the same purpose as controlling
networked appliances from a wide area network. Do existing RPC mechanisms have User location
facilities? What about authentication? My personal opinion is that RPC could be used within the home
domain and not outside it. Comments?

This is purely an implementation issue.

Section 1.4.5 (RFC or bis) specifies that a Location Server may
use various other protocols such as LDAP to find a user.  Sitting
one "Location Server" in front of each protocol, and querying
multiple Location Servers is indistinguishable from sitting
the Behemoth Location Server in front of many protocols, and
only querying one [the Behemoth] Location Server.  In fact, like
all things, a "Location Server" is a logical role, so one
could concede that using multiple "Location Servers" is really
only using one Location Server that happens to talk to other
types of Location Server.

>      B. How does the location server return a User address ? Is
> it a address of the User's or a SIP server's?  

(I'm assuming by "SIP server" you mean a proxy or redirect
server, here; in general, any entity that receives requests is
a SIP Server.)
That does not matter, and in practice, you're never going to know.

For instance, it is not hard to conceive a proxy that serves
a company that has two distinct sites, A and B.  A is the primary
site, so all SIP traffic for the company first goes to a proxy
situated at A.  The proxy at A talks to a location server that
knows where employees can be found.  If the employee is located
at site A, the location server will return the address of the
employee's SIP 'phone; if the employee is located at site B,
the location server will return the address of a different
proxy that serves site B.

Therefore, in some cases a Location Server is returning the
ultimate UA address, and in other cases, it is returning the
address of a proxy that is better suited to handling the request.

A location server may return zero or more results for a URI
lookup.  Note that however many results it returns, user location
need not be any slower if the search is done in parallel.

And yes, it could be wasteful, if the URI mapped to tens or
hundreds or thousands (yada, yada) of possible locations.
However, in practise, this is unlikely to be the case.  In the
Grander Scheme of things, how many contact telephone numbers
does a person typically have?

HTH,


 - Jo.

Hi, had some further queries on the SIP rfc2543bis Draft

Maybe some of these were reported before - if so pls ignore.

*)
The link on the SIP Site mentions the draft date as Jul 17th, downloading
it shows a date
of Jul 13th on the draft (PDF)

*)
 Page 19, in description of telephone-subscriber uses %x HEX HEX notation
instead of  % HEX HEX (I guess this would
have been corrected in Jul 17 version ?)


*)
Table 4, page 35 puts Content-Language header as "m" for all messages. I
dont think this is true.
The HTTP draft (which is referred to by the SIP draft) also marks it as
optional.

*)
Draft says Contact header is mandatory for INVITE. Table shows 'o'

*)
Page 13, point 7, line 2 : s/preent/present

*)
Page 39, Alert-Info grammar still has strange characters
(I think someone reported this on Call-Info  header too some time ago)


*)
Page 14 & Page 27:

Page 14 says:
"A successful SIP invitation consists of two requests, INVITE followed by
ACK.TheINVITE (Section 4.2.1)
request asks the callee to join a particular conference or establish a
two-party conversation. After the callee
has agreed to participate in the call, the caller confirms that it has
received that response by sending an ACK
(Section 4.2.2) request. If the caller no longer wants to participate in
the call, it sends a BYE request instead
of an ACK."

while Page 27 says

"A BYE request from either called or calling party terminates any pending
INVITE at a UA, but the
INVITE request transaction MUST be completed with a final response and
ACK."

It seems while the former suggests that ACK can be replaced by BYE, the
latter mandates the ACK. Is this an
mis-inerpretation of the text on my part ?

*)
Finally, just out of interest (not any comment as such):
In page 36,  Table 5, Record-Route interest, 2xx is written instead of 200.
  Is anoyone out there using
any 2xx class response besides 200 OK ? ( I saw the others in the HTTP
draft like 201-206)

Scott Petrack's message indeed made me realise that to my impression we all are not really sure on what the duty for SIP will be.
A real danger what is possibly going to happen is that we all want to add headers and other extensions to SIP, that before we realise, SIP will act like a fat pregnant elephant instead of a sleek and fast gazelle.

SIP is indeed very good at Initiating a Session, and then hand it off to a different protocol. Like RTP or RSVP etc. Preconditions set in the header will also be a good idea, but for exactly which protocols?

In fact, what do we plan to use SIP for? We all have a different idea what we want SIP to do for ourselves. I am not immune either.
Maybe it is a very good idea to form a consensus on what we want SIP to do for us.
Do we want SIP for:
Only IP-telephony?
Also Multimedia IP sessions on 1. a computer, 2 a mobile digital board (PIM/PDA/WAP/UMTS phone etc)?
Do we want home appliances and other machines be able to send us info via SIP?
Do we want to send instant messaging via SIP?
Do we want SIP to track mobility of the user?
Do we want to use SIP to handle the AAA services? (Billing of network usage and QoS and the service from content providers, like a database search or keeping track of the IP session duration and the amount of data passing through the UAs used for the session)?

With good planning, many of those tasks can overlap each other.

If we try to make a list of what the required duties of SIP are and what can be handed off to the protocol that SIP is initiating the session for.
Then we can really define which headers are really necessary for SIP (like the media type <video, audio, text> and language <english, dutch, french>, and which headers will just refer to the preconditions of the handed off protocol <Security options and QoS options and OSP tokens for AAA services>).
With our combined visions, we should be able to do this. 
The ideal to obtain is publish it once and then many years without any new versions of SIP. While the possebilities of SIP continue to expand (at application level).

Also, when we know which protocols are required to team up with SIP, we will get those protocols also finished and ready for use.
Future protocols should be easily be added to SIP in the Content-Type header (draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00).
So that most future changes will be on UAs level on how to process the offered protocols, instead of how to send/receive and read/write/understand SIP messages.

Well those were my 2 Euro cents.
This mail is not intended to show any disrespect nor to discard all the efforts. I just hope to have all of us team up and sail in ONE direction.

I am hoping that someone can ehlp me I am putting together an agenda for a
workshop on SIP which will run along side a conference on all-IP mobile
networks.

What topics hsould be included in such a workshop and do you know of anyone
who might be interested in leading such a workshop.

Pease contact me for more details.

Hi,

Can someone explain for those of us that were not there, what at a high
level were the controversial parts of the TIPHON WG SDP presentation and
what the basic objections to the proposal were. I didn't really get a proper
feel for the issue from the slides or the forwarded email.

Thx,

Hi all,
    In my opinion, the fact that SIP is being extended to incorporate functions other than Session
Initiation, need not be one that has a negative impact. The reason for this is that all these
extensions add features to the protocol that are relevant to a particular service, like say IM, in a
manner which does not affect the operation of other functions. Many of these extensions probably
make use of the User location and authentication facilities offered by SIP in order to achieve their
goals. All the specific processing takes place in the end points, which are configured to particular
needs. If an end point does not support the MESSAGE  method then it rejects it. Another UA will
probably take care of IM only.

    The network components should take care of routing in an extension independent fashion.All
extensions should place least requirements on these elements. These rules should ensure
interoperability among devices with varying capabilities.

    A suggestion:  Is there harm in trying to incorporate MGCP functionality into SIP using the
presence and IM extensions, similar to the control of  NA's ? :-)

    Comments?

When the phone was invented its main purpose was believed to be
to enjoy opera music from home. Interactive conversations were
not on the list of applications. Have a nice set of prints from
the 1890's about the "Future of the Telephone" on this topic.

Arnoud,

I'm allowing myself to try and answer these valid questions although it's
not really _my_ answer I'm giving, but rather a summary of answers I got
from various key people in SIP to which I posed similar questions. I think a
lot of people are wondering about these things so I hope I can save them
some time. If I'm missing a point I'm sure someone will correct me before
long.

SIP is a signaling protocol where signaling is a shapeless, ever-growing
term that roughly means "establishment-modification-termination of some sort
of interactive real-time session between any two entities". The sessions may
include voice, video, IM, games, a combination of those and much more (no,
telnet is not included).  The entities may be software clients for the
above, IP phones, telephony GWs, mobile devices, Softswitches, MCUs, play
stations and what-have-you. Each group brings its own (possibly) unique set
of requirements to the signaling protocol. Throw into this pot also services
(yet another vastly overloaded term) which SIP is supposed to accommodate:
anything from transfer to next-gen
your-refrigerator-is-calling-to-say-you're-out-of-milk. In short signaling
in the context of SIP is a pretty big thing now with lots of different
interest groups and lots of different priorities. The question (and I think
that's basically what you were asking) is how do you accommodate all of this
within one protocol. 

The answer is composed of two words: generality and extensibility.  Baseline
SIP (RFC 2543) attempts to be both general and highly extensible. All the
fundamental session management stuff which is applicable to all applications
(establishment, modification, termination, capabilities exchange,
registration etc.) is there in the baseline spec.  There's very little
application-specific stuff though. This is intentional.  The fundamental
idea is: "if you want something more - extend or, better yet, use an
existing extension".  Baseline SIP provides mechanisms to add new methods,
response codes, headers header params and much more and it allows extension
announcement and negotiation so all parties of a call can be sure that a
required extension is supported by all others.  You can say extensions are
encouraged in SIP.  And there are plenty of extension proposals as anyone
reading this mailing list knows.  None of that is supposed to penetrate into
RFC 2543, though. It's supposed to remain pure and backwards compatible for
ever (Jonathan R's words: "there will be no version 2.1 of SIP"). The
extensions will continue to develop and move along the standardization
process as independent entities and eventually (hopefully) the "good"
extensions will be finalized and gain popularity and the "bad" ones will die
out from lack of demand or technological merit.  There's not going to be a
planning committee that says "this will become a part of SIP from now on" or
"this is what SIP is about to be used for" because reaching an agreement on
such issues is close to impossible.   


That's my 0.08 Shekel (2 US cent equivalent) :)

Itmar,

Thank you for your reply.
Your answer did confirm many of my musings and wonderings and eased my worries.
The most important part is indeed that reference to Jonathan R's words: "there will be no version 2.1 of SIP".
I am glad to see that the extensions proposals are seen as a seperate entity. And later, the good ones will deserve an official place next to SIP.
This means that all UAs are required to read the RFC2543 defined headers, and can ignore any other headers?
So in fact it is up to the UA creator to accept the "good" extensions given in the drafts.
It may still be a very good idea to reach some consensus on which extensions are most promising and stimulate their acceptance. (note, it is then only to give developers an idea, not that this is a law on itself.)

This is a good question and one that we thought a lot about, so I'd be 
happy to share some of our thoughts on this subject with you.

First, I do not think that we are really using SIP as an RPC mechanism. 
Though an argument could be made for the case when we want to query the 
status of a device (e.g., "what's the temperature"). However, we believe 
that there is a need to communicate with networked devices in several 
different fashions:
1. Send a command to a device (e.g., "Turn on the light"). This is very 
similar to Instant Messaging except that it is to a device instead of to a 
human user (or application). So we propose to use the MESSAGE method in the 
impp drafts.
2. Query a device (as mentioned above). While it could be viewed as similar 
to an RPC, it could also be an Instant Message with an acknowledgement
3. Establish a "session" with a device (e.g., "view the baby-cam", or "send 
audio stream to stereo"). For this you would use a SIP INVITE with an SDP 
payload.
4. Asynchronous events (e.g., "notify me when the security alarm goes 
off"). This requires an event mechanism and the impp drafts describe 
SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages that could be used for this.

We were not able to find one protocol out there that could easily support 
all these communications paradigms. While it is true that several different 
protocols could be used, we believe that there is great value in using one 
protocol to support all these mechanisms for networked device 
communications. To only require one common infrastructure to be deployed, 
maintained, and managed is a big plus (IMO) for any architecture. There are 
maybe only a few devices (like a camera that establishes a session to 
transmit a video stream, and also accepts commands, e.g., via MESSAGE, to 
control -- e.g., pan, zoom, etc.) that may have convergence of these 
communications paradigms, but there will be many home domains that require 
this convergence.

In addition to supporting the previously mentioned communications 
mechanism, networked devices also have other requirements. For example,
- a general purpose addressing scheme
- support for mobility/forwarding
- security (privacy and authentication/authorization)
In our opinion, SIP was the only protocol we found that met all of the 
combined requirements.

Perhaps the framework draft does not do a good enough job of outlining 
these (and other) requirements and we would be better off with a separate 
requirements draft.

We know that SIP was not originally intended for this purpose, but we think 
that using SIP for networked appliances does not put any additional 
burden/requirements on SIP (assuming the impp drafts are incorporated) and 
only adds to the overall attractiveness of SIP.

I hope I answered your question(s), if not please let me know and I will 
provide additional info/detail.

The draft is a little hand-wavy on this because we werre not entirely sure 
how to make it happen, but I don't think this case is specific to networked 
appliances.

Our thoughts on how to do this would be for the UA in the home domain to 
REGISTER with it's home domain proxy, then do a DNS look-up and check the 
SRV record to see if there is another SIP Proxy listed for it. If there is 
(e.g., the service provider proxy), then it should also REGISTER with that 
proxy. Is this allowed -- we do not see why not?

I believe many service providers would fully agree, given the
cost of OSS and skill sets required for every protocol in the
network.

Three reasons not to do this:

- two protocols already exist for this (MGCP and Megaco);

- very few of the SIP mechanisms are useful here. Generally, MGs and
MGCs are stationary (with regards to each other), for example.

- SIP is peer-to-peer, MGCP/Megaco is master-slave.

This is indeed one good example where the model does not fit well. SIP
is not a reliable datagram protocol for random content.

The most recent one in http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/drafts/ is to

This is a common misunderstanding. %x40 is from the ABNF spec, %40 is
the URL escaping. The two serve different purposes. To reduce confusion,
I've used the escaping version now.

While there may not be something other 200 right now, we'd like to keep
this possibility open.

Nobody can keep you from doing this if you insist (as long as you don't
want to turn it into an Internet standard), but you'll find that there
are more appropriate mechanisms, as discussed on this list a few weeks
ago. RTP works just fine for JPEG, regardless of whether you send a
frame a second or a frame a week.

Some of the Corba facilities use directory-based mechanisms to locate
(effectively) servers, but interdomain use does seem to be rare at this
point.

Scott,

I'm very relieved that other folks with a SIP background are thinking about
the sort of combination you suggest.

After lunch with the BEEP chair, I drew the following conclusions.  Please
note that these are my personal opinions, and not necessarily those of my
employer, etc.

- Both IMPS and IMXP satisfy the base requirements for IM and P
- SIP is superior for handling *mobile* presence
- The SIP MESSAGE method is simple and apropos for messages that fit in one
datagram
- BXXP is much better for bigger messages (GIF/JPEG, powerpoint, shared
browsing...)
- SIP could easily setup BXXP sessions


thanks,
-rohan

Minor point, but some terminals that can send audio may not be able to
send and receive DTMF via RTP.  A UA which had a telephone plugged into it,
would probably need a DTMF detector, but would not need a DTMF generator.
A sipphone which had a keypad could fake DTMF send, but would not
necessarily have any use for DTMF reception.

I think it's all okay.
A POTS equipped UA would generate DTMF RTP (and events) to work with
legacy apps and SIP-aware apps.  If it was sent DTMF RTP, it would
just ignore it (actually, I have a use for it, but it's all within
the UA)

A sipphone without a DTMF generator would work fine in all circumstances
unless it connected to a device that did NOT send DTMF inband on the audio
RTP,
but used DTMF RTP only, and expected the user to "hear" tones.  The user
would
hear silence.

I continue to be concerned by the complexity of all of this. As pointed
out, every Ethernet phone will need to support RFC 2833 (and it's pretty
trivial to implement, given that RTP/RTCP is needed anyway). Instead of
adding another mechanism, it would seem better to have the generic
ability to get end systems to send to multiple copies of audio streams,
including subsets. This is more generally useful for multi-party calls. 

(As a side note, I'm still not sure how useful this audio/DTMF split is
in practice, given the wide use of voice recognition. Also, given that
not all end systems will implement anything beyond basic 2833, in
practice you'll end up with trivial 'RTP splitters' that route DTMF
packets to one server and audio to another.)

Finally (separate issue), I just don't see that there is a practical
difference between DTMF and 'user input'. User input is just a subset of
DTMF (minus loudness). Hopefully, both will disappear over time, as user
devices have richer input capability. We don't want to redo
telnet/rlogin or X11 in SIP.

The UA needs to know the purpose/semantics of the SDP.

For an SDP, the UA could either setup that session for immediate media (as
in Session: media), or it might need the session description to setup
QoS/Security/Firewall holes/Whatever, where it DOES NOT setup media.

When a UA gets SDP, it needs to know if immediate media is needed, or not.

If this is not clear, please see the section on the Session header in the
expired 183 draft.  It articulates the need much better than I could typing
in the back of a session.

The SDP for manyfolks will have the a=qos: attributes whether the SDP is
needed for media or not.  See my example below (only relevant headers/SDP
info shown).  B supports manyfolks, but A does not.

INVITE ->
From: A
To: B 

<- 180
Content-Disposition: preconditions;handling=optional
a=qos:optional sendrecv confirm

<- 200
Content-Disposition: session;handling=required
a=qos:failure sendrecv

ACK ->

So with Content-Disposition, a bis-capable UA, should know what a body is
for, and if the body is optional or required, without having to know the
semantics of the body first.

Hi,

I think this is reasonable, but for higher bit-rate messages, I think a
starting a specific application from the SDP would be appropriate (per
Christian's proposal). The transport could be RTP, TCP, BXXP, whatever.  I
would draw the line at MESSAGE requests fitting in a single datagram.  

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

I think we may have a slightly different definition of first and third
party.  I'd say that the moment an app switches from first to third, it
becomes third party and can subscribe to DTMF events.  Perhaps I should say
that a first-party cannot *take action* on DTMF events, but a thrid party
should.

If a 1st party app subscribes to DTMF events, there is a danger that it can
count the same DTMF event twice (once from RTP, and once from the event).
My preference is to avoid that slippery slope completely, and make a clean
delineation.  I have seen this kind of problem first hand.  It is hard to
troubleshoot, frustrating to the user, and it is not deterministic.  The
last double-DTMF problem I had only affected an apparently random portion
of the DTMF events.  It took a long time to discover why.

thanks,
-rohan

while the message flow and size would be appropriate for message, we need
to decide if we agree with this usage or instead with Jonathan's guidelines
doc .  The guidlines doc says not to overload INFO to do device control,
etc, etc, ; and that a method name should convey the verb associated with
the method.

which do we want? 

	a) CONTROL and QUERY methods?
	b) use MESSAGE  and SUBSCRIBE (for a fetch)
	c) use another app setup with SIP INVITE
	d) use a completely separate protocol

This is not a decision limited to "wierd" applications like refrigerator
temperature, light bulbs and coffe pots (no offense intended). 

One feature that really could take advantage of a CONTROL method is Far-end
camera control for video sessions.  You could also use such a method for
conference moderation/control.  Jonathan specifically said conference
control is out of scope.

I agree that both 3 and 4 are completely apropos for SIP.

I agree this is desirable and is easily supported if the device only needs 
to support SIP (plus RTP) to send either type of message. If a different 
protocol is required to send a text page that is an additional requirement 
on the device. While it's not difficult to have a PC (or even a PDA) 
support multiple protocols, we're looking at low-cost consumer devices 
where very extra bit of RAM is going to increase the cost to the consumer.

The message translation is only for devices that don't communicate with SIP 
(or one of the media protocols that SIP would initiate a session for, e.g. 
RTP). The translation is "mandatory" because that is the only way to 
communicate with a device.

In many cases we only desire to send a simple command to a device (e.g., 
"Turn off the coffee pot") and in that case, setting up a session with SIP 
to send an RPC is a lot of overhead (plus requires two protocols -- SIP and 
the RPC).

Here are a couple of more inconcistencies and questions,
this time vs the 2543bis-01 draft (July 26).

1) In 2 (SIP Uniform Resource Locators):

   The "np-queried" value for the user parameter is no longer
   present in the SIP-URL syntax, but it is still referenced
   in the text about telephone-subscriber.

2) In 6.38 (Route):

   The syntax for Route was not uppdated along the changes
   made to the syntax of Record-Route.

3) In 6.47.1 (Via: Requests):

   It is stated that the port specified is the port where the
   user agent wishes to receive responses.  But what if TCP is used
   as transport protocol.  Should it be the port of the local end
   of the TCP connection, or the master TCP port of the user agent?
   I assume it is the latter as the client would otherwise be
   required to open the connection before being able to create the
   message.

4) In 6.47.4 (Via: User Agent and Redirect Servers):

   Is it not better to use the existing TCP connection also if
   the address in the "sent-by" value differs from the source
   address of the packet (i.e., the same as mentioned under the
   third bullet)?  This would effectivly result in adding a
   new bullet after the first stating to use the existing TCP
   connection if available (and removing that text from the
   third bullet).

5) In 6.47.5 (Via: Syntax):

   Should not SCTP and TLS be specified for the transport
   rule too (they are after all defined for the SIP-URL)?

6) In 10.1 (Behavior of SIP Clients and Servers: General Remarks):

   Should not SCTP and TLS be mentioned too, or maybe this
   needs a total check throughout the draft?

7) In 10.3 (Behavior of SIP Clients and Servers: TCP):

   "If the client closes or resets the TCP connection prior to
   receiving the first final response, the server treats this
   action as equivalent to a CANCEL request."

   What if there has been multiple requests for different calls
   over this connection that has not yet received their first
   final response.  Should all of them be cancelled (I suppose so)?

I would like to receive an answer for this before I leave on Monday
for the SIP Bake-Off (if possible :)

As mentioned by Marshall Rose, there are several protocols that
may work equally well...

From the perspective of a network service provider, it may be
advantageous to have the smallest number of protocols on the
network to deliver services. Each new protocol means extra
resources to develop and maintain OSS, skill sets etc. From this
point of view, having SIP do many things is an advantage IMHO.

Also, as mentioned in the meeting, service providers are part of
the food chain.

No, its the former. The spec says that if TCP is used, the response goes
over the same connection as the request. It is only if the server needs
to reopen a connection to send a response, that it would use the port
number in the Via header.

I agree.

I hate playing market analyst, but:

From the perspective of a network service provider, it may be
advantageous to have the smallest number of *implementations* to
deliver services.  If I need one SIP product from company X which
provides IMPP services and another SIP product from company Y which
provides multimedia session management services, that will require
extra resources.  Similarly, if I have a single product which
implements both SIP's multimedia session management and some
hypothetical separate IMPP protocol, that won't require extra
resources.  (Well, not any more than a single product which implements
both features of SIP.)

Don't confuse protocols with implementations.  Whether the traffic for
applications A and B are framed the same way and/or go over the same
port is basically irrelevant to service providers.

Also, from the perspective of a network service provider, lumping
multiple applications into the same protocol makes it harder to
filter the protocols separately.

I think that MESSAGE is definitely not appropriate for what you are
trying to do. It is along the same lines of the continued abuse of INFO,
whereby totally different semantics are defined through the inclusion of
different bodies. MESSAGE means one thing and one thing only - "please
render this content for display to someone, and it represents a message
which may be responded to and is part of a conversation thread". Any
other usage is inappropriate. 

SIP is primarily appropriate when you wish to be involved in
communications with some entity which is moving around; where you have
only an abstract identifier that names this object (user@domain), and
based on that you need to rapidly contact that object at one of the many
places an instance of that object might be available. "involved in
communications" might mean initiating a session, asking for
notifications about changes in that objects communications states,
sending it an instant message. 

I am yet to be convinced that this application fits into that category.
Will my lightbulb be moving around? Will it be reachable at multiple
places? Doesn't seem like it. What, for example, is wrong with using
http for this? I can have a mini-web server that presents an interface
that I can use to control the lightbulb. The same architecture with
proxies and authentication and interworking units operates just fine
there.

if the POTS equipped UA was plugged into an answering machine, you might
want to generate DTMF to it when you get DTMF RTP.

Only if the codec didn't pass in band DTMF well and you wanted to
use the DTMF codec to deal with that.

Of course these are implementation issues, and anyone can
choose whether to do so or not.  For your purpose, you want
UAs to send DTMF RTP.  Whether it recieves them or not
isn't important to your problem.

This makes great sense *if* the IM stuff you want to do is session-oriented.
We should remember that IM does not necessarily mean chat; it should be easy
to send someone a message without setting up a session.  (To use my
motivating example: a calendar sending someone an event notification just
wants to send the message; it doesn't expect a reply [and can't handle one in
any event], so setting up a chat session would not be helpful.)

I am acutely aware of this problem, as both an active promoter of sip
and one of the most vocal opponents against many uses that I consider
inappropriate.

There is a thin line between reuse of infrastructures and protocols, and
abuse of a protocol which only hurts long term interoperability and
viability. I have been attempting to capture this balancing act in the
"guidelines for authors of sip extensions", which will continue to
evolve as our understanding of this subject increases.

the complexity is in the number of services, more than the
number of protocols. overloading several services on top of 
a single protocol doesn't solve the problem.  it might even
make things more confusing.

also, if the different uses of SIP don't have the same usage
patterns, it doesn't necessarily make sense to overload multiple
functions on a SIP server.  you want to provision machines 
differently depending on the usage patterns of the protocols
they support.

none of the above argues for different presentation layers
(though there are other arguments for not reusing this aspect
of SIP), but it does argue for not bundling multiple functions
within a SIP protocol.

There is also another line. Extensions are potentially bad if they
increase the N^2 problem of interoperability for similar devices, and
the number of cases (does the other side have feature 1? 1+2? 1 or 3?,
etc.) that need to be tested. It is probably less of an issue if the use
of SIP is either go or no go. (In that sense, I find the use of SIP for
sending control messages less dangerous, since it is unlikely that a
phone worries about lightbulb messages or vice versa, so that the these
can be implemented without lightbulb implementors having to be VoIP
experts, and vice versa.)

This is encouraged by clear labeling of methods, message bodies
(Content-Type and Content-Disposition), Require and other mechanisms.
The worst problem in extensions is, I believe, mutual dependence or
deadlock, such as "You can't do X because my completely unrelated
application relies on SIP doing Y."

Currently, "feature interaction" seems to be a particular problem with
the proliferation of SIP-for-VoIP features (COMET, PRACK, 3pcc, session
timer, REFER, etc.) rather than simpler "new stand-alone methods that
don't interact with anything else". (PRACK and COMET are examples where
new methods *can* interact with existing methods and can raise feature
interaction issues.)

The other complexity concern is N ways of doing very closely related
things (DTMF comes to mind for some reason...)

Hello all,

  Good afternoon.

  Has there been any thoughts on what should be done in case of "Hide"
  header is present and the previous hop Via has been received from a
  different network address, in case of which the proxy will append a
  'received' parameter to the topmost received Via.

  Hiding is performed only on the "host" and "port" but the received
  parameter is still forwarded un-encrypted, so we are exposing route
  information here.

  Thanks for your time and inputs. Have a very good day!!

Regards,

Nilesh Trivedi.

OK.  I think there may have been a misunderstanding of what we're proposing
here.  What we are proposing is to use MESSAGE *only* to carry the
command/query/whatever between the communicating endpoints.  When MESSAGE
finally reaches the destination SIP UA, the body is extracted and passed to
the controlling application.  The SIP UA *is not involved* after MESSAGE is
received.  The architecture of this is illustrated by the following stacks:

SIP is used only to carry information on what to do with the lamp to the SIP
UA in the Appliance Controller.  It is then the Appl. Controller's job to
extract the control information and do something with it.  (In the example
above, it controls the lamp via an X.10 interface.)  I would say that this
does not affect the semantics of MESSAGE.  The receiving SIP UA treats the
incoming MESSAGE as if it were an instant message.  Once the MESSAGE is
received, the receiving UA extracts the message from the body and passes it
up to the controlling application (in this case, the Appliance Controller).
In fact, it may even be possible to demo the above scenario using a SIP
based IM system, and treat the Appliance controller as an IM user.

Firstly, it is likely that Appliances will be moving around alot.  They'll
be going from home to hotel, home to home, home to conference venue, home to
car, home to bus etc.  OK, you're unlikely to move your refrigerator around
that much, but it's very likely that appliances such as the Internet Alarm
clock will be moved around (especially on business trips!).  So there will
be a great need to address them as they move between locations and domains.
Henning has already mentioned the possibility of 'naming' your appliances,
so that my kitchen stove could be stove@simon.home.net.  This reference can
then be added to your 'favourites' address book.    Using HTTP to do this
will require explicit addressing (like the SLP URL Stan showed in the
presentation yesterday) for every single request, and cannot support the
more friendly object@domain representation.

For sure, we could set up a mini-web server in the home to control
appliances which stay in the home, but IMHO I don't think it's a viable (or
scalable approach) for appliances which are moving around alot.

Please feel free to shoot me down in flames if you think I'm way off the
mark here.

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, and this is why we're proposing to use a new MIME type (DMP == Device 
Messaging Protocol) for the payload so that if an IM-based system got a 
message destined for a device, it wouldn't just try and render the content 
(since it would be an incompatible/unknown MIME type).

We discussed using a different message (instead of MESSAGE), but we decided 
that another message type with (what we thought were) very similar if not 
identical semantics would be too/more confusing.

Actually, I'm not sure if I agree that most appliances will be moving 
around a lot, but we do have to allow for that possibility. We definitely 
need to use an abstract identifier because we can't assume that the details 
of device name/addresses in a home domain are known to entities in the wide 
area (outside the home domain). This is one of the reasons that http won't 
work.

In addition to the addressing problem mentioned above, for 
devices/appliances that don't need an intermediate appliance controller 
it's probably overkill to have a mini web-server. Plus that would only work 
for control, what mechanism would you use for events and steaming media 
(especially to the device)? We believe a common (SIP) infrastructure for 
all these communications paradigms is best.

Hmm, now you have me confused. If we have the following two agents:

	Client-A			<----------->	Server-B
	Master TCP Port: 5060				Master TCP Port: 5070
	Sending TCP Port: 4711		

Would the Via that Client-A sends in this case look like:

	Via: SIP/2.0/TCP Client-A:5060

or, would it look like:

	Via: SIP/2.0/TCP Client-A:4711

My expectation was that the TCP conection would be between
Client-A:4711 and Server-B:5070, and that is where the response
would be sent, unless the connection has been closed for some
reason, in which case Server-B would open a new TCP connection
to Client-A:5060. This would imply that it is the first of these
to Via's that is to be used. Am I right? (This, I believe, is
what I tried to convey in my first message above.)

1. Would it be beneficial for a UAS use SIP (or SDP) to ask (or tell) a UAC
to enable or request network QOS, like setting TOS, for RTP media, or even
SIP?

2. Would it be beneficial for a UAS use SIP to query a UAC to report
measured QOS, session performance, or accounting info?

draft-ietf-sip-2542bis-00 claims, in section 6.45.1, that all requests must
contain at least one "Via:" header. Yet there are examples in the same

1. End user: Integrated IP communications with SIP
  - Telephony, multimedia, data conferencing,
  - Presence
  - Instant messaging with text, voice
  - Games, etc.

2. Architecture: See the seven I-Ds submitted

3. Operational: My previous comments

4. Vendors: Several SIP implementations for the above.

What is the problem you are trying to solve?

Fully agree. Some of the steps seem to have already been walked,
but it will be useful for the whole group to go over all the
steps again together. Would be great to get to an agreement.

Mike,

A client is not a trusted device, so it can only request QoS,
but the request has to policed in some way by a trusted network
element.

Please see two related approaches:

and

I assume this should be in the manyfolks draft, presumably as a separate
parameter, as in

Content-Disposition: session ;handling=required ;precondition

Interesting (if peculiar) example. This syntax is directly from
HTTP/1.1, which is also silent on the topic how implementations should
handle this. Strictly speaking it depends on what the line separator is.
If you have

To: "Some string\[CR][LF]
continued

Only the CR is escaped. The LF begins another line and would need to be
indented.

On the other hand

To: "Some string\[CR]
continued"

is just a single line. Should definitely be added to the torture tests.

Of course it does. You are not displaying them to a user for the purpose
of messaging and communications. If you are including content that has
semantic meaning to some upper layer system, its not a MESSAGE. Its
something else. MESSAGE does not just mean "deliver this to higher layer
protocol stack". It means a very specific thing - render this content to
the user, where this rendering is some kind of communication which might
be responded to. 

There is no shortage of method names. 

Another way to look at it is this; if you message were misrouted, and
sent to some other SIP UA, would the "right" thing happen? No, it would
not. With MESSAGE, the client will redner the content. 

Stan Moyer adds:

Thats really bad. Come one. If you use xml, its going to be
text/xml+dmp, in which case the IM client will likely render the xml.
You want to bank on the right thing happening by hoping the guys
messaging client is really strict and won't try to render your content?

There are no shortage of methods. There is no surcharge per letter or
anything. I promise.

Most likely I'm the one moving it around. Why would I need wide area
access to my own alarm clocks? Seems like the devices I need wide area
access to are the ones I don't have with me to move around, i.e., the
ones pretty stable in my house (alarms, oven, fridge, lights, etc.).

I don't dispute that they might possibly in some cases move around, but
it doesn't seem like the typical case. Choosing a protocol just for
support of an unlikely case doesn't seem like the right thing to do.

Why isn't the addressing http://simon.home.net/stove? I can't add this
to my bookmarks? The addressing is just as explicit as in the SIP case.

Yes, they are always required since the UAC MUST insert them.

This already came up on the list and we agreed it should be hidden also.
In fact, this has already been folded into rfc2543bis. Quoting section
6.26:

> A server hides the previous hop by encrypting the host (in both sent-by and via-received), port,

I believe SIP should abide by the SDP grammar. Period. If SDP says its
zero or nine-or-more characters, so be it.

Sounds like the kind of nasty things that happen when there are two
completely different ways to do the same thing. As I suspect you will
not be able to cleanly define a role as either 1st or 3rd, with a clean
changeover during which you would never receive events, sounds like one
mechanism is the right way to go.

So let me be specific about this sharing of resources that I have been
advocating:

1. SIP proxies are, at the core, routing engines. They route independent
of method (MESSAGE or INVITE or SUBSCRIBE). Service providers deploy
them in numbers to get scalable session establishment amongst their
users. These proxies would be able to be reused completely, and with no
additional management cost. What is used to get an INVITE from user 1 to
user 2 gets an IM from user 1 to user 2. 

2. SIP networks have repositories of data (I don't want to say
databases, since the precise implementations vary - some use real
databases, some disk, some memory) which represent the presence status
of users connected to the network. Right now, these data repositories
are used primarily for the routing functions I mentioned in point 1
above. It is this exact same data which you need for SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.
The exact same. So, my deployed data repositories, and all the tools I
already have to manage looking at it, adding users, etc. are all going
to work for provision of presence services. 

3. People are building SIP devices like phones and PDAs of all different
sorts. These devices will be able to be communicated with through their
usage of REGISTER, which is used to upload their presence (location and
availability) into the data repositories in point 2. Now, by using this
mechanism as the one used for presence publication, all of these devices
now become things I can also subscribe to. The devices don't need to be
specially enabled for presence. Don't you think it would be cool if it
were possible to subscribe to someones cell phone and find out if its
off or on?

Will there be additional management costs for deploying presence?
Surely. You will need additional infrastructure for managing the
subscription lists and the notifications. However, the additional costs
are much, much less than they would be if I needed to duplicate the
stuff I am mentioning above.

Let us not bypass the benefits afforded to users of the system. I think
it is fair to say users will want to have services that integrate
presence with voice, video, and other communications. Thats happening
today. By using the same infrastructure for the two, some neat services
become possible:

1. I get a new sip phone, plug it in. Now, people can subscribe to that
and know when I am talking on the phone. 

2. I indicate that I don't want to receive calls from Bob after 5pm. I
subscribe to a service which "reflects" these preferences into IM and
presence too. This way, I don't get IMs from Bob after 5pm, nor will I
honor his subscriptions.

Can these kinds of things be done without SIP for presence? Sure. But
with much more complexity. Take service 2. I would implement this in SIP
by an access control mechanism in my proxy server that, when it receives
a request from Bob, rejects it if its after 5pm. Now, this
implementation will, for free, reject INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and MESSAGE
with equal ease and little extra work. Thus, providing an integrated
communications filtering service is easy. In fact, its *extra* work to
make the service different depending on the communications type (not
much extra, of course). 

In IETF (the iptel working group) we have also developed this thing
called CPL (Call Processing Language), which is a simple XML scripting
language for expressing preferences for sip call routing. Its "uploaded"
into proxy servers, and right now its logic executes when an INVITE
arrives, controlling how the session initiation is processed. It can
express things like service 2 above, plus other things like forwarding
preferences. I can route calls based on time of day, caller, subject,
priority, etc. Don't you think it would be nice if I, the user, could
have as an option this CPL apply to both calls, IMs, and presence
messages? Is it not reasonable to say that I want high prioirty IMs and
high priroty calls to go to my cell phone? Very, very easy when the same
infrastructure is used. Just make sure your CPL executes on not only
INVITE, but also MESSAGE and SUBSCRIBE. Thats it. 

If IM and presence are in a totally separate system, I need to worry
about how these kinds of things are programmed in both; propagated to
both, and kept consistent. What server is handling the IMs? How do you
present a unified interface to the user that can provide both? What if
they don't have the same control interfaces for programming these kinds
of services? This is very hard. The result - increased cost to the
service provider, increased time to deliver, resulting in a poorer user
experience.

So, from the grounds of service provider benefits *and* user experience
(the latter being something we all agreed was very important), how can
you argue that such convergence is bad and the wrong direction????

No, a B2BUA will do exactly that. A proxy never *initiates* a new
request. The difference between initiate and proxy is that (1) the via
headers are reset, (2) the contact header is set to the initiator, (3)
possibly other things, but at least 1 and 2.

Perfectly fine thing to do in a B2BUA.

The recent mails recommending flex/bison, lex/yacc etc., for the 
SIP parser have confused me a bit.

I'd like to know the `granularity' of the tokenizer/parser split.

For instance,
---------------------------------------------------------------
sip_msg : request | response
        ;

request : request_line header_list CRLF
        ;

request_line : METHOD WORD SIP_VERSION CRLF
        {
                /* hand-decode the request uri */
            if (! decode_request_uri($2)) {
                /* handle error somehow */
            }
        }
        ;

where WORD is a token denoting any sequence of characters 
without whitespace, cr-lf chars, and the comma.

For example, its lex specification may be:

[^ ,\t\r\n] {
    return WORD;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

My question is because I found it hard to parse, say, the sip-url 
using the flex/bison route. 
Since yacc and bison generate a LALR(1) parser, I had conflicts 
while trying to parse:

    hostname = *(domainlabel ".") toplabel ["."]
    domainlabel = alphanum | ...
    toplabel = alpha | ...

The conflict was because bison couldn't distinguish between 
domainlabel & toplabel with its one-token lookahead. So that ended 
in a reduce-reduce conflict!

I'd like to know if this is the right approach:
1. tokenize the input string into words (of course, some words are
   easily distinguishable, like methods, Accept, To, From etc.,)
2. hand-verify the words that yacc couldn't handle (like urls).

Or is it possible to make yacc handle everything by 
tweaking the grammar?

Any pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks very much.

Hi there,

In RFC 2543bis (July 26th) Section 15.1.2 (The Authorization Request
Header), the definition of the Authorization Header is, for PGP:

Authorization =  "Authorization" ":" "pgp" #pgp-response
[...]

Shouldn't that be:

Authorization =  "Authorization" ":" "pgp"  1#pgp-response  ?

Thanks,

dENIS

hi all,
  i have few queries to ask :

1) if caller requests the foll.
      m=<some description> 0 1
      a=sendrecv
  if the callee supports only sendonly with 0
   and recvonly with 1 then how can he specify this
   in his response
would it be:
      m=<some description> 0
      a=sendonly
      m=<some description> 1
      a=recvonly
  but the above will voilate the sip rfc where it specifies that
there should be one to one mapping b/w the requests and the response.

2) The netmeeting tool of Microsoft implements the H323 stack and there
we have a provision for file transfer too, can we do the same using SIP 
stack,
but how will we convey the request in the SDP.

3) another query on SDP responses:
   if caller sends a request:
      m=<some description> <fmt>
      a=recvonly
   and the callee supports it, does it have to change the a= value to
   sendonly in the response i.e.
      m=<some description> <fmt>
      a=sendonly
   or the above will be assumed by the caller on receipt of the positive
response

Unless you are scheduling events into the past (before 1931), you'd
never need fewer than 10 digits.

Yes, actually so I thought, for all practical purposes.

Maybe some implementors need to get back to Y2000 ;-)

In response to the several questions about the location of the missing
"Via:" headers, the missing via's start (or, more correctly, don't start) on
page 106 of the PDF version (section 16.6), with Alice's server replying to
Charles'. Missing via's continue with section 16.7, "Negotiation", and 16.8,
"OPTIONS Request," etc.

How do you know that's the address? Why isn't it 
http://simon.home.net/cooker? or http://simon.home.net/grill? Or maybe you 
know the name, but how do others know? We need a standard way to "search" 
for the correct service in the home -- access to devices/appliances in the 
home will not always be done by people, it could also be done by 
network-based services (I can give examples if you want). The SIP Proxy 
mechanism provides a convenient way to route the message to the correct 
(home) domain, where the more abstract address can then be resolved.

Also what's the address for subscribing for the event that the timer has 
gone off and my meal is done -- you probably can't (or at least shouldn't) 
use http for that?

So, I guess the answer is that, yes you could use http for some of the 
things you need to do with appliances, but it's not optimal for the whole 
problem space.

I would argue that the reasons you are arguing for convergence in the 
thread, "Re: [SIP] a proposal for a way to compromise? (really, not a 
joke)" , e.g.,

>...Let us not bypass the benefits afforded to users of the system. I think
>it is fair to say users will want to have services that integrate
>presence with voice, video, and other communications. Thats happening
>today. By using the same infrastructure for the two, some neat services
>become possible ...

are many of the same reasons you would want to use SIP for networked 
appliances/devices.

um, hello

i've just noticed that the much loved and adored received parameter
does not actually obey the generic-param syntax:

generic-param: token=token|quoted-string

received=host[:port]

the problem is that : is not a token and so received does not conform.

can we make : a token? or does that ruin other stuff.  i've had a quick
look (by no means through) and couldn't find any conflicts.

or do we leave it as it is and have the attitude that everyone should
know of the received parameter and how to parse it.

it would have been nice to handle the un-encrypted and encrypted
received parameter the same way (i.e. just read a token and then
un-encrypt it if neccessary) however this does not allow that.

thoughts?

Fellow SIP enthusiasts,

Lately there seems to be a tendency for claims to be made that SIP can solve problems being
addressed by various other working groups. HTTP, mobile IP, instant messaging, IMAP, the
list goes on. Now, maybe SIP is flexible enough to serve as a dessert topping and
a floor wax (and a paint remover, and....), but another possibility is that this is
part of the normal process at IETF. People who are enthusiastic and knowledgable about
a particular protocol that is beginning to see widespread success begin to look at what
other problems the protocol can solve, in some cases, making claims about the protocol
in areas where there are other protocols that do an equally well, if not better, job
in solving the problems, or the other prococols could be easily extended to do the job.

The problem with SIP is that it is being closely watched by the telephony standards community.
Unlike the IETF, they have a very different process of standards development, and so
they are not familiar with how IETF works. However, they *are* familar and very, very
comfortable with circuit switched, and so when they see claims about SIP being made for
solving all these problems, they tend to think that they can turn to SIP for everything,
and turn a SIP proxy into a switch, and define all their services in terms of the switch.

This is a particular problem when authors of seminal, standards track IDs or RFC-track
informational IDs make such claims. When the claims are being made by a second
year graduate student or MTS 2, they can be critically evaluated, but when they are
made by leaders in the SIP community, the telephony standards community tends to 
view them as being made by "the" IETF itself.

What would perhaps be somewhat more productive is if people who see problems with other protocols 
in regard to how they interact with SIP or real time media to participate in the appropriate 
working group and help to define the interaction rather than simply asserting that SIP
can do it better.

All right, that said, I've donned my asbestos suit (with noise and mouth filter to prevent
inhalation of asbestos fibers), let the flames begin.

While I'm no fan of overloading names, I don't think it's quite as clear
cut as we'd like. Some considerations:

- It's bad if the same type of device (or the same name) gets two types
of messages with very different meaning. This doesn't seem likely in
this case.

- We already have different content for INVITE, distinguished by
Content-Disposition. It's a bit a matter of taste whether to use a
different Content-Disposition or a different message.  Thus, you
definitely need a different Content-Disposition, other than render.

- Having the same message makes sense if filtering, for example, would
likely be the same for both.

One could argue that a message being displayed to a user is just
electrons on phosphor. A message to a lightbulb is just a one-bit
phosphor. (After all, sending a MESSAGE to the Times Square news ticker
is nothing but turning on *lots* of lightbulbs... It's also likely to be
one-way.)

In this case, it's a matter of abstraction whether MESSAGE is taken as
only stuff that's text displayed to human users or more general.
Reasonable people can disagree, I believe. Do we need to apply a Turing
test to the recipient?

In summary, I think either a new message type or MESSAGE can be made to
work as long as the type of content is labeled clearly, not just in
terms of syntax but also semantics. If lots of people think it's
different enough and can describe the difference in some generic term
("MESSAGE is for messages for human consumption and is not expected to
have other consequences; generally two way", "CONTROL is for messages
for machine consumption that may trigger things, generally one-way"),
it's easier to just use another method name and be done with the
discussion.

I still don't understand the harm to SIP even if mobility is rare right
now (with suitable authentication, devices in cars may be quite usefully
be accessed remotely, e.g., for maintenance and diagnostic purposes).
Web clients are very hard to automate and script, so I don't see this as
a viable alternative in all cases.

There are clearly two opposing problems here:

(1) invent new protocols or protocol stacks for each new "vertical"
application (the ITU approach, to some large extent)

(2) re-use a single protocol for things where there are better solutions
(HTTP certainly has suffered from this problem and SIP may or may not)

Part of the evolution of application-layer stuff is that things that
used to be nicely separated aren't. HTTP is used to retrieve email,
email is used to send web pages, etc.

I don't think anybody here wants to replace IMAP by SIP, say, but there
are certain problems that 

There's also the new danger that we'll have small devices dominated by a
single function rather than workstation OS that support a whole range of
things, from a web browser to an IMAP client. For these devices, it is
sometimes easier to "abuse" an existing protocol than implement a whole
other protocol. Thus, the temptation is rational, if dangerous is
unchecked.

There seem to be two possible dangers:

(1) Feature creep into SIP.

(2) Servers have to implement two ways of providing information, namely
the SIP way and the "native" way. (If you like, the WAP problem.) 

(1) is more likely to be self-correcting, since the pain and gain are in
the same community. (2) is where collateral damage is most likely.

Maybe we need to address the items in turns (and I'm guessing here at
the overlap issues that you might object to):

HTTP: the line seems to be that as long as HTML or other "web" content
is part of the signaling exchange, this seems about as useful and
necessary as sending HTML in web messages rather than pointing to a web
URL. If there's an existing web server and URL, referral seems much
better. I don't see much temptation to venture there.

IMAP: I assume this is about message indication. There is indeed a
dangerous slope there, but one that industry seems to have slid down
long before us. (See the Yahoo instant messages when email arrives.)
IMAP is poll, so there does seem to be a need for notification, but not
retrieval.

Mobility: I see some value here for SIP for service and personal
mobility, but not as a replacement for mobile IP, except where mobile
IPv4 with binding isn't available. (The sentence doesn't make sense, but
there's a difference between a protocol being available in an RFC and
being available where I work or get my ISP service.)

IM/presence: Not sure if you're specifically referring to IM or presence
(the two seem rather different to me), but I don't think I have to add
to *that* discussion. 

Maybe a bit more precision on your part would be helpful.

That's indeed bad, since it may break generic parsers. Since the port is
not in RFC 2543, might it make sense to define received-port as a
parameter.

I don't want to extend token since that would conflict with RFC 822 and
RFC 2616.

It seems I missed the moment when [:port] was added to "received". What
problem is it supposed to solve? 

Firstly, the source port is quite likely to be different from the one
listed in Via even without the NAT and the "received" most certainly
should not be added in that case. Secondly, the latest 2543bis I could
find is not very consistent on the subject: 6.47.2 first says that
"received" is added when the source address doesn't match the address in
the Via, next that it's added iff source address _and_ port differ from
the ones in Via.

Besides, if you use the NAPT, specifying the port in "received" doesn't
help. In any case, just correcting Via is not very helpful for NAT
traversing (e.g., how are you going to send re-INVITEs or BYEs in the
reverse direction?) so I'd rather keep the "received" parameter as
simple as possible (i.e., leave it the way it's defined in RFC2543).

Thank you,
Igor Slepchin

Mindo on my part. This was a failed attempt to deal with NA(P)T. Thus,
it should be gone not just for syntax reasons.

How did you know the address was stove@simon.home.net? The URL above is
merely a syntactic translation. Web servers act as fronts for data
stored, in fact, elsewhere. Same case here.

No, probably not. This debate is going on in another thread on the

I don't see the analogy. Presence, voice, video are all forms of
communications. Its reasonable to want to screen an IM from someone and
their phone calls at the same time. In what ways would I want services
which integrate me talking to my refrigerator and me controlling it?

What about a TV which acts as a message center? When a MESSAGE arrives,
is it a message to be displayed to the person watching, or a control for
the device itself?

True, but in no case does the content of the message alter the
underlying semantics of the method or response code. It always provides
additional information that qualifies it. Here, its fundamentally
altering what happens to it.

These things serve much different functions. I think its likely you
would have very different policies for filtering them.

This introduces yet another place an implementation needs to look at to
figure out what the purpose of the message is. Method is for that
purpose.

This is certainly one of the dangers. Henning has outlined others. More
generally, I believe that the continued abuse of SIP for all these other
areas will end up in a protocol that is so complex that people are
afraid to implement it, and with so much stuff and extensions, no one
can sort out what they do and don't need to solve their problem. What
scares me the most are interdependency of extensions, especially ones
that are very distinct (see the other thread on the proposed usage of
MESSAGE for device control). These are the things that can very quickly
bring SIP towards a death of contorted complexity.

To date, we have kept SIP limited to the field of initiating,
terminating, and modifying communications primarily between people (or
their automated agents like answering machines). All the accepted
extensions in the SIP wg relate to this general field. 

I like SIP. I have dedicated a lot of time to it, and I want to see its
successes continue. It is because I believe in it that I have, and will,
continue to fight against uses which fall outside of its core
application. Now, what people do in their labs and in conference papers
is their own choice, and I'm happy that they experiment with SIP. But,
bringing it to IETF is a much more serious affair, and I think we need
to be very careful here.

Someone once told me that most startup companies don't die from
starvation, they die from indigestion. I think we can possibly argue
this here. I don't worry about SIP dying from starvation. But now I do
worry about it dying from indigestion.

The SIP and World Domination has been an interesting thread. Yes, SIP is
great for signaling (aka finding, connecting and terminating) and then
handing over to the appropriate session protocol. Can SIP do more? Sure,
extensions are a way and changing semantics and definitions (which leads
to problems later), it can do more. But the real question is Should SIP
do more? I am not sure. When we bash our circuit friends and their
H.323, the first argument we say is that it is an overkill for IP
telephony? Guess who will have the last laugh?
Keep it simple. Elegant protocols survive the long run. Complexity is
easy to add, but difficult to live with.

The other argument about one infrastructure solves all problems?
Hmm..didn't we have different data, voice, and video networks before? It
worked. And then came convergence with IP and when that happened, we are
struggling to differentiate? Gosh, the DiffServ groups or class-based
QOS groups would have no problems, had their been separate networks to
begin with? After studying the QOS approaches in depth, I am more
inclined to say, "Just add more bandwidth stupid?" and if new
applications emerge and consume, try finding more lambdas and then
gammas within the optical path (are you guys watching the optical stocks
lately?). The management complexity headache is not worth what we
actually achieve via incremental performance gains.

And aren't there so many other camps that think they can dominate the
world? I believe there is some project going on at MIT called Oxygen
that solves all the worlds problems. And then there is Bluetooth which
connects all the devices and appliances at home. WAP believes it has
conquered the world. Wait until bio-tech reaches a point where I can put
a UAC and a UAS inside my embedded heart chip that will talk to my lung
chip (SIP I guess??). Aha, a day of BAN (Body Area Networks). I wonder
where the proxy will reside? In my stomach perhaps.

There is nothing more beautiful than a simple elegant protocol design
that does a few things, but does it damn well. I sensed from the list
that there is some kind of victory being announced for SIP. Isn't this
really premature?
Anyway, my 2 cents...

This scenario will never happen.  The users of the message centre will have
their own addresses to identify them (e.g. jdrosen@messages.jdrosen.home.net
or more generally, messages@jdrosen.home.net) while the TV as an appliance
to be controlled will have its own address (e.g.
TV-controls@jdrosen.home.net).  The users 'TV-controls' and
'jdrosen@messages' (or 'messages') will have their own SIP UAs.  There
should be no confusion at all about how MESSAGE gets rendered.

I still can't agree with you here.  I think Henning is right.  Surely
Content-Disposition: does just what you argue against?  The
Content-Disposition header describes what should be done with the body when
it's received at the UA.  With the current parameter values, the UA can
either set up the session using the body (which is assumed to be SDP) or the
UA displays/renders the body to the user.  Hence it is fundamentally
altering what the UA does when the SIP message is received.  Am I
misunderstanding the purpose of the header?

This has been an interesting discussion and I'm grateful for all the
comments.  If other people on the list also feel so strongly about it, then
we could introduce a separate method from MESSAGE.  But I'd rather use
MESSAGE with a new Content-Disposition value defined.

Have a nice weekend.

Thanks,
Simon

There is much point-missing going on here.

There are applications that work best using speech recognition for
user input & control. There are applications that work best with
facial gestures as user input. There are applications that work best
with smell recognition as user input (baby monitoring?). There are
applications that work best with key input. 

DTMF has NOTHING to do with this issue. Just because a device has keys
on it doesn't mean it is a DTMF device. For example - SIP terminals
and personal computers have keys, but they don't generate DTMF.

I expect small portable devices with a tiny screen, a few buttons, and
an audio interface will become one of the most popular devices for
personal communications in the future (if they haven't already). These
devices won't use DTMF in the long run. These devices will certainly
have voice recognition. However, many automation applications will
want to use the buttons on the user's portable device for user input
to the application, just as other applications will want to use a
voice interface. 

There are many reasons why an application provider would select key
input as the preferred application interface method. Key input makes
it easier for the user to keep input private in a crowded room than
spoken commands (or facial gestures). Most users feel more comfortable
entering passwords and account balances using keys on their WinCE pad
or SIP portable phone rather than speaking into it. Imagine the CEO on
his cell phone telling his automated broker: "Sell all my stock" in
the lunch room at noon.

Buttons can be language-independent. Arabic numerals are common to
virtually all languages. Pressing the '1' button is exactly the same
act in all languages. Saying 'one' or 'balance' is a different act in
just about every language. No doubt, mechanisms can be provided to
normalize spoken utterances to a common form, but this will certainly
be at a great increase in complexity, a significant increase in error
rate, and at a much higher cost. No doubt there are applications that
will accept this cost, but many will not.

I will venture to predict that, while speech and facial gesture
recognition will eventually become mainstream technologies (and speech
reco is almost there), they will NEVER (at least not in this
millenium) come close to being as cheap to implement as a keystroke
recognition algorithm. Vendors that need a low cost, reliable, input
mechanism for their simple applications will choose key input every
time. Even 50 years from now. 

Simplicity, universality, privacy, cost. These should be enough to put
to bed the issue about "in 5 years everything will be speech
recognition (or facial gestures recognition, or smell recognition)".
Key input is a fundamental input mechanism. Button-pressing as a user
input mechanism is not going to go away next year or in the next
several decades (until we get a direct brain interface - dream
recognition maybe?). Even then, cost constraints and ease-of-use will
mandate key input devices for many applications.

What WILL eventually go away is DTMF. At some point, when the last
loop-start analog line has bitten the dust, the requirement for
audio-based end-to-end signaling will end. Key input will live on, but
not with DTMF. The requirement for an end-to-end signaling mechanism
with keys for input will live on, but not with DTMF.

Users will still want to find out if they are overdrawn in their
e-money account using their new fusion-powered portable communications
device (PCD) while waiting in line for tickets at the spaceport. The
application will validate their ID by requesting that they press their
thumbprint on the device keypad sensor. The user will be asked to
indicate their requirements by pressing one of the 12 labeled
flexi-keys (dynamic visual key labels) on the keypad. Key selections
will also be presented by voice prompts into their wireless invisible
earpiece (well, not really invisible, just teeney). This is still key
input. Just 21st-century style.

Keys, Words, Nods, Gestures. All user input. All appropriate for
certain applications. 

Kevin Davis explains the issue quite well in his post:

I'm afraid I will have to respectfully disagree with Henning
Schulzrinne, Christian Huitema, and Mark Peck in their dismissal of
key input as a short-lived or somehow inferior user interface
mechanism, compaired to speech input.

There is nothing inherently better or worse about speech, or key
manipulation, or facial gestures, as a mechanism for communication.
The application providers will make the decision about appropriate
communications modes, thank you, not the protocol designer. The
protocol designer's job is to enable ALL of these methods of
communication for the application designer, not to dictate one, either
by fiat or performance bias. A protocol suite should provide several
protocol choices that are applicable each to a general class of
communications (ie TCP & UDP), and every reasonable communication mode
should fit snugly and efficiently into one of the protocol choices. 

Regardless of its somewhat illegitimate birth (see my talk on DTMF key
input given at the 48th IETF), the paragigm of end-to-end key input
that exists in the PSTN today is probably THE major factor in the
expansion of ubiquitous automated services in the network. Without
"press one for sales", the world economy would have millions more live
'operators' answering phones and reading rote answers off of computer
screens, and millions fewer productive and innovative workers. That
single error by Ma Bell back in the 70s may have done as much to raise
the efficiency of the economy as the invention of the computer.
Millions of applications, from bill payment to air conditioning
control, use the keypad and speaker of the ubiquitous PSTN terminal
device to provide a simple, universal remote control UI.

So now, how do we make sure that we maintain this wonderful end-to-end
communications mechanism for the future? Loop-start lines will go
away, and so will DTMF. But we still need and want that key press that
travels all the way across the network, from terminal to terminal, be
it packet or circuit. It is time to design the next-generation key
input transport protocol, and DTMF ain't it! Hopefully, we can do
better than the Telco 'mistake' this time around. "Gosh, Toto, we
aren't in Toneland anymore!" 

Enough for now. My flight is about to arrive at D/FW airport & I am
anxious to get home. We need to examine the various proposals for key
transport in light of the above discussion. 

Subscribe/Notify?   Info Method?    RTP?   Which should it be? 
Remember, the day is arriving quickly where most devices won't
generate tones upon keypress anymore. Should you burden the future
with the past? Or make sure you can leave the past behind?

It's not that I think that key(board) input will go away, just that it
won't be 12 buttons with numbers and */#. The notion that this is in any
way tied to telephone service will go away. We'll obviously have lots of
key input. It's the web now, both forms (including speech input) and
applets, telnet/ssh/rlogin, IM, irc and maybe other mechanisms.

Why tie remote key(board) input to SIP or VoIP? If telnet (and kin) or
web-based input modalities are not good enough, we need to discuss this,
but that has nothing whatsoever to do with VoIP. SIP may or may not be
the appropriate solution there. I don't want to SUBSCRIBE to the
keyboard, I want to have an appropriate interaction with an abstract
user interface that is far richer. For simple ASCII, telnet will
probably do the trick (or the WAP "card" mode, if you like that model).

Also, RFC 2833 (first part) has nothing to do with tones. It transports
signals which may, in the current analog phone system, have a tone
representation. Analogy is the relationship of telnet and pixel
rendition.

I think this is a terrible example. The proposed usage of MESSAGE for device
control (see draft-moyer-sip-appliances-framework-00.txt for those not
following this thread) does not propose any extensions or modification of SIP
(beyond the impp drafts). In fact, a SIP Proxy that was written to handle the
MESSAGE (and other Presence) extensions would not even know the difference
between a MESSAGE sent for Instant Messaging or one send for device
communications/control. In fact, neither would a SIP UA client/server stack --
it's only the end application above the UA layer that would have to handle
things differently. I don't see how that adds to the complexity of SIP (unless
I am missing something).

But is it really that much of a stretch to communicate between
devices/appliances instead of people? You refer to automated agents -- I
believe many devices/appliances are simply automated agents for people.

I think that is a noble cause and a good idea, but we do need to be careful
what we rule out just because at first glance it does not appear to fit its
core application. There is certainly a benefit to the overall acceptance of SIP
by extending the scope of services it can support if it does not increase the
complexity.

Jonathan,

Would you still object to using SIP for networked devices/appliances if we used
another message name? For the longest time we were ready to propose a new
method that we had been calling KICK for the purpose of sending a message to a
networked appliance/device. Then when we ready your impp drafts that proposed
the method MESSAGE, we thought there would be a benefit to using the same
method/message since the semantics seemed very similar (or at least we thought
so). The main benefit is that a SIP Proxy and/or SIP UA stack that supported
Instant Messaging and Presence would also support networked appliance/device
messaging -- new Proxies and UA stacks would not be required. This would be
very advantageous in terms of compatibility and interworking.

But, if you believe that the negatives outweigh the benefits in this case, we
could be persuaded to create a new method/message (but at this point in time I
am not convinced).

I don't think arguing a different solution (i.e. protocol) for each of the
requirements (e.g., how to address control messages) for supporting
networked devices/appliances is fruitful. Yes, an alternate solution (from
SIP) is possible for each of the requirements, but when you combine most or
all of the requirements, then SIP does appear to be the best solution.
Since there are many requirements and considerations for supporting
networked device/appliances, maybe it would be best if we meet face-to-face
to discuss these in detail (it would take awhile to cover in this mailing
list). We'd be happy to host a meeting or visit you (and anyone else
interested would also be welcome to attend).

The only difference is communications between people and communication
between devices. They are just different types of entities, but still have
a need to exchange information (e.g., communicate) via audio, video, and
data. For example, what if your refrigerator had a built-in video-screen
for communications (I know that sounds far-fetched, but I have seen a
concept video from Intel with just that scenario). And even if you don't
talk with your refrigerator, you probably would (at the very least) have a
phone in the kitchen and wouldn't it be nice if the same infrastructure in
the residential gateway (for the home) and the service provider could
support both services?

Hi Henning,

I am not sure what you mean by the last sentence. You assert that web
clients are not always the best solution because they can be hard to
automate. Do you intend imply that SIP clients are somehow easier to
automate, and therefore a better solution in those cases? I'm not sure I
understand your point.

Thanks!

Ben.

Web interaction relies on forms input, either as PUT or GET (? query).
Web forms are generally designed as HTML forms. Only GET can generally
be bookmarked, with a very limited expressiveness and kludgey syntax.
(And GET is not supposed to change the state of the resource, while that
is clearly what you want to do for a control mechanism. Also, see the
dislike for SOAP expressed elsewhere...) 

Appliance control, in my view, will be a combination of automated agents
and human interaction. I would even guess that many larger appliances
will have both a web server and a more message-based mechanism. For
small appliances, having a UDP-only mechanism has distinct complexity
advantages.

In addition, in a kind of strange reversal of roles, while HTTP could
conceivably be used for retrieval of state and (mostly human)
configuration, it offers no notification mechanism. Thus, since
notification is an inherent feature of devices, it is convenient to have
the same protocol to both directions.

It might also be relevant to note that technologies such as the web were
originally designed for human interaction, although now many wish that
we had more labeling (as in XML and the efforts for standardizing
ecommerce field names, inter alia) making it more suitable for
machine-to-machine interaction. I suspect that even SIP notification and
messaging will see a similar evolution from mostly human-to-human to
various mixtures.

Also, there currently is no equivalent technology to sip-cgi and CPL for
HTTP. (There's obviously cgi, but that's in the server itself and not
really where you want it.)

I have to admit that I continue to be somewhat perplexed by this
discussion. We have dozens of SIP extensions that truly do change and
complicate SIP to provide the feel of 19th century telephony (well, or
1970s user interaction), and here we have one that adds nothing (beyond
a method, depending on taste) and works by adding a different content
type. To me, that indicates a strength of the underlying
SIP-for-presence model, not some errant digression.

Henning

Well, for these non-session-oriented exchanges 
SIP people just made the "MESSAGE"
method. This is designed to use the
usual mobility infrstructure of SIP to deliver the message to the correct
endpoint(s).

If you just wanna find the endpoint and deliver some MIME content once,
I'm not sure there's much room for differences. Except that there are a
lot of useful things you'd probably want which SIP does already (mainly
mobility and delivery to many people at once, delivery to many instances
of 'you').

So I guess I was thinking about the other cases.

It appears from this mail trail that the reticence for using SIP
for appliances are due not from the merit of this use, but
rather from philosophical/principles considerations of
overloading the use of SIP and "world domination". IMHO let's
stick with merit and specifics: There is a solid case as stated
by Stan Moyer and others to use SIP for appliances.

This discussion has BTW omitted the most common appliance:
Phones!  :->)

Here are three more inconsistencies I have found in the 2543bis-01
draft:

1) In 3 (SIP Message Overview):

   MIME-Version, Alert-Info and Call-Info are missing from table 3.

2) In 6 (Header Field Definitions):

   According to table 3 Authorization is a request header, and
   WWW-Authenticate is a response header. This also corresponds
   to their respective texts describing them. However, in table 4
   and 5 both Authorization and WWW-Authenticate are listed as
   acceptable in both requests and responses. 

3) In 11.2 (Behavior of SIP User Agents: Callee Issues Response):

   It is stated that the Contact header MAY be present. If I
   am not mistaken this should be changed to MUST for final
   responses to an INVITE.

Added (these headers were tentatively added, pending WG consensus).

This raises a larger issue, namely response authentication. One
possibility which was discussed during the IETF meeting was to
transition to MIME-based security, using S/MIME (RFC 2311) or MIME-PGP
(RFC 2015). In that mode, both requests and responses can be treated the
same. However, since SIP needs to sign and encrypt headers as well as
message bodies, you end up with something like

     INVITE ...
     From:  ...
     To: ...
     Mime-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/encrypted; boundary=foo;
        protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"

     --foo
     Content-Type: application/pgp-encrypted

     Version: 1

     --foo
     Content-Type: application/octet-stream

     -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
     Version: 2.6.2

     [some encrypted message]
     -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

where [some encrypted message] would be again a SIP message. From what I
can tell, the data to be encrypted looks something like

Content-Type: message/sip

INVITE ...
repeating all important headers

[SDP] body


For basic and digest, authorization makes sense both ways and should be
symmetric. This clearly needs to be fleshed out; I doubt that anybody
actually implements response authorization at this point.

For what its worth I completely agree with Skip here on the use of 12d 
keypads in applications. These classes of terminals will not go away and 
will only increase in usage for several reasons particularly mobile.

1. The use of E.164 numbering to identify SIP endpoints ( aka The ENUM WG , 
since I'm co-chair I need to get a small ad in here) and E.164 numbering is 
Globally Unique.

2. As Skip rightly pointed out numbers are Linguistically Neutral 
..something the IETF is still trying to deal with in IDN.

3. Numbers are "domain less" addressing.

4. I continue to hear arguments about voice recognition taking over  but 
I've heard these arguments for 10 years now and DTMF imput for applications 
just gets bigger and bigger.

the point is not which one will take over the world. The point is that the
applications are similar in many many cases. Today the user experience is
that s/he can

press '1' or say 'yes'

Now it's just not really relevant that 99% of the people press '1' and 1%
say 'yes.' Nor is it relevant that there will be many places where one can
only press '1'. What is relevant is that the INFORMATION to be encoded and
transported is IDENTICAL, whether '1' is pressed or 'yes' is said. So from
the presentation layer down to the transport layer, it's hard to see why
we need two different methods.

I got the impression that Skip and others wanted to enable the Internet
and Internet-connected devices to offer the same key input service that
the PSTN and
PSTN devices offer today. Well, today, whether '1' is pressed or 'yes' is
said, the real-time data is transported to a remote device and gets
interpreted into a 'user input command'. 

The point of people who identify voice reco with key input is that it is a
recipe for trouble if these two end-user events get transported in two
completely different ways. If you need the keypress to be transported
along the signalling path, then you also need the "yes" to be transported
along the signaling path. And the encoding should also be as similar as
possible, since the information to be encoded and transported is similar.

In both cases the data should be encoded and transported as RTP, because
this is the only way you will get the same key input service that you have
today. It is the only way to put saying 'yes' and pressing '1' on an equal
footing, where they need to be. 

If you want to build an IVR controlled signaling point, it is no problem
at all: the first answer to the SIP INVITE points to a host that can
receive ONLY the DTMF payload type, no other. At this point, the calling
phone can receive prompts via G.xxx ordinary audio, and the calling phone
can only send DTMF back (because that's the only codec the answerer
supports). This host might well be a signalling server. It is hardly
rocket science to build an RTP stack which supports the DTMF codec only. 
After some DTMF, the session can be modified so that the call is
transferred to another host which can handle the proper audio codecs.
This is the translation into IP telephony of the service which exists
today, which as far as I understand, is the requirement. What is the
problem with this solution? Is the problem that the signaling server now
has to understand DTMF-in-RTP, this is really not a very difficult codec
to master, and surely we all prefer to have one way of doing one thing
than having two or three? In addition, I'll bet that you'll find it really
useful to be able to have multiple receivers for the DTMF, etc. all the
standard RTP services for this audio signaling.

It may well be that there is a need for some new signaling to tell a
device to go into key input mode, or to send the DTMF codecs to one place
and the ordinary audio to another, or something. But these needs have
nothing to do with the encoding or transport of the information, it seems
to me.

Hi Henning,

Thanks for the clarification.

In my mind, the controversy over the appliances draft, is that it proposes
to use SIP and the event extensions as a general purpose process to process
message passing and event protocol. Or if not general purpose, then at least
for the fairly broad category of device control. Do you see this as true?

I have difficulty deciding whether this is a good or bad thing. Past
attempts of the IETF to work on general purpose event mechanisms has gone
nowhere, with the general reason (excuse?) that the requirements for event
mechanisms are too varied for one protocol to support them. Now that we
propose to add event extensions to SIP, I expect to see a wave of
application proposals to use SIP as the general purpose approach.

I for one believe we _do_ need one or more general purpose event protocols,
and am willing to _consider_ using SIP for that purpose. I am not so
concerned that such use would actually harm SIP; I just wonder if it is the
best for the job.

The questions I would like to see considered are the following:

1. Is SIP (with event and message extensions) an appropriate platform for
general event and message applications, particularly in a device to device
or human to device model.

2. For a given application of said extensions, how do we decide whether it
is a good fit? For example, what if instead of refrigerators and lamps, we
proposed to control and monitor medical equipment or industrial processes?

Yes. However, it's not the only such extension. We've already seen two
others, namely the PINT version and the use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY for
mailbox notification.

For this, it would help to see where the differences are, in general,
between h2h and h2d etc. modes, beyond that the description of the state
is different.

Note also that this question has two types of answers:

(1) What would be an ideal protocol mechanism, within the constraint of
being physically achievable or a given network infrastructure?

(2) What is the best protocol framework with existing tools?

For example, the cost and availability of anycast and multicast may well
change the answer.

This is similar to the question as to whether SIP is a good way to call
911, i.e., are Internet protocols such as SIP sufficiently reliable and
robust for applications where failure of communications has significant
negative consequences. Since SIP is targeted for first-line telephony,
among other applications, the answer better be yes, otherwise, we have
far more serious problems than lightbulbs.

hi all,
Pl. answer the queries or refer a url
i have few queries to ask :

1) if caller requests the foll.
    m=<some description> 0 1
    a=sendrecv
if the callee supports only sendonly with 0
and recvonly with 1 then how can he specify this
in his response
would it be:
    m=<some description> 0
    a=sendonly
    m=<some description> 1
    a=recvonly
but the above will voilate the sip rfc where it specifies that
there should be one to one mapping b/w the requests and the response.

2) The netmeeting tool of Microsoft implements the H323 stack and there
we have a provision for file transfer too, can we do the same using SIP
stack,
but how will we convey the request in the SDP.

3) another query on SDP responses:
if caller sends a request:
    m=<some description> <fmt>
    a=recvonly
and the callee supports it, does it have to change the a= value to
sendonly in the response i.e.
    m=<some description> <fmt>
    a=sendonly
or the above will be assumed by the caller on receipt of the positive
response

Well, at least philosophically, these fit more closely into the realm of
"normal" SIP applications. However, since I am down to only objections of
philosopy rather than objections of fact, I will concede the argument. As
you said earlier, the appliance draft does not propose any new extensions
for device control, and therefore it doesn't really add complication to SIP.

I withdraw my objections.

Thanks!

Ben.

Hi

With respect to the following web site and backwards compatibility,
should this be the main source for SIP grammar bearing in mind the
modifications and new additional headers which are found in the later
bis drafts.

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/SIPgrammar

Thanks for any help

Hi actually this is only a hyper linked version of the grammar in the SIP
draft, and is for ease of navigation only
I have yet to update this HTMLised grammar to reflect the new draft
changes.
(its a little backdated wrt new draft...)

 Please refer to the grammar in the bis draft  and not h
ttp://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/SIPgrammar
as the definitive reference

If you have not already done so, please look over

convenience) and comment.

We missed the original target for completing this
work. If there are any issues with the draft, lets
work through them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Here are the changes since the previous version of
the draft:

 . The method was renamed to reflect its function instead of this 
    particular application of its function. TRANSFER and Transfer-To 
    became REFER and Refer-To. REFER was generalized to support URLs 
    beyond those indicating SIP INVITEs. 
  . A Require header is no longer required. Bodies are allowed. 
  . Copying Call-ID from the request was replaced by using a Refer-To: 
    URL containing any headers that should be use. 
  . Added a way for the identity specified in Refer-To: to know it has 
    been referred to. 
  . Added a mechanism to prove the identity of the issuer of the REFER 
    to the identity specified in Refer-To. 
  . The failure response returned to an attempted REFER has been 
    changed from 603 to 503 to facilitate different behavior in the 
    cases of "I won't accept that REFER" and "I tried that REFER and it 
    failed" with Retry-After: support for the later.

  =20
  This document defines a SIP [2] extension and details its use to=20
  provide Call Transfer capabilities. This is part of a family of Call=20
  Control extensions described in the Call Control Framework document=20
  [3]. =20
  =20

  until the conferencing features in this framework are addressed.=20
  =20
  This work has roots in draft-ietf-sip-cc-01 [4] but some basic=20
  semantics are different. In particular, transfers are achieved through =

  a new method that does not terminate the original signaling=20

          significantly different from what a current PBX or=20
          Centrex user expects. As the call-flows in this=20
          document show, this is not the case. A client MAY=20
          preserve the current experience. In fact, without=20
          this requirement, some forms of the current=20
          experience (ringback on unattended transfer failure=20
          for instance) will be lost.=20
  =20
    3. The Transferor MUST know whether or not the transfer was=20
       successful (this is significantly different from the requirements =

       of draft-ietf-sip-cc-01). =20

5  The REFER Method=20
  =20
  REFER is a SIP method as defined by [2]. The REFER method indicates=20
  that the recipient should contact a third party using the contact=20
  information provided in the method. A success response indicates that=20
  the recipient was able to contact the third party. The REFER method=20
  follows the session's current signaling path. In particular, the=20
  Request-URI of the REFER method identifies the recipient.=20
  =20
  Unless stated otherwise, the protocol for emitting and responding to a =

  REFER request are identical to those for a BYE request in [2]. The=20
  behavior of SIP entities not implementing the REFER (or any other=20
  unknown) method is explicitly defined in [2] and is not discussed=20
  further here.=20

  Refer-To is a request-header as defined by [2]. It may only appear in=20
  a REFER request. It identifies the transfer target.=20

     Refer-To =3D "Refer-To" ":" URL=20
  =20
  A REFER method MUST contain exactly one Refer-To header.=20

5.2 The Referred-By Header=20

 Referred-By is a request-header as defined by [2]. It can appear in=20
 any request. It conveys the identity of the original REFERrer to the=20
 referred-to party, optionally proving the identity and that the=20
 REFERrer actually issued this reference.=20

 =20
     Referred-By      =3D "Referred-By" ":" referrer-url referenced-url=20

     signature-scheme =3D token=20
     sig-scheme-parms =3D token "=3D" ( token | quoted-string )=20

 The referrer-url contains the SIP URL of the party sending the REFER=20
 request. The referenced-url contains a copy of the URL placed in the=20
 Refer-To: header. The ref-signature contains a signature over the=20
 concatenation of referrer-url and referenced-url.  An example=20
 signature scheme is given in section 5.2.1.=20

 A REFER request MUST contain exactly one Referred-By header.=20

 The Referred-By header SHOULD be signed to help detection of REFERs=20
 from unauthorized third parties. A signed Referred-By header SHOULD=20
 include a Date header in the referrer-url to facilitate detection of=20
 replay attacks.=20

  the request contained zero or more than one Refer-To headers. An agent =

  responding to a REFER Method MUST return a 400 Bad Request if the=20
  request contained zero or more than one Referred-By headers. An agent=20
  (including proxies generating local responses) MAY return a 100 Trying =

  or any appropriate 400-600 class response as prescribed by [2]. If the =

  recipient's agent decides to contact the resource in the Refer-To=20
  header, a 200 OK response MUST be returned if it the contact was=20
  successful, otherwise a 503 Service Unavailable MUST be returned. The=20

  REFER may be attempted again. =20

          mean either "I tried and failed" or "I'm broken and=20
          couldn't try". In either case, if a Retry-After=20

5.6 Behavior of SIP User Agents=20
  =20
  A UA receiving a well-formed REFER request SHOULD request approval=20
  from the user to proceed (this request could be interactive or through =

  configuration). Upon receiving approval from the user, the UA MUST=20
  contact the resource identified by the URL in the Refer-To: header.=20
  Note that if the URL is a SIP URL, it could contain header fields such =

  as Call-Id that will be used to form the resulting request. If the URL =

  is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the REFER request should be=20
  copied into the request sent to the referred-to resource. In=20
  accordance with [2], the UA SHOULD issue a provisional response to the =

  REFER method if it cannot issue a final response within 200ms of its=20
  receipt. The appropriate response to issue to the REFER on receipt of=20
  a final response from the referred-to resource is discussed in=20
  "Responses to the REFER Method".=20
  =20
  A REFER request is meaningful only in the context of an existing=20
  session. A UA receiving a REFER request for an unknown call leg MUST=20
  return a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist and MUST NOT contact=20
  the resource identified by that request's Refer-To header as part of=20
  the REFER transaction.=20
  =20

5.7 Behavior of SIP Registrars/Redirect Servers=20
  =20
  Since REFER has meaning only in the context of an existing session, a=20
  Registrar or Redirect Server that is not also playing the role of a=20
  User Agent (never issues a 200 OK in response to an INVITE) MUST=20
  respond to a REFER request with a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not=20
  Exist.=20

5.8 Behavior of SIP Proxies=20
  =20
  SIP Proxies do not require modification to support the REFER method.=20
  Specifically, as required by [2], a proxy should process a REFER=20
  request the same way it processes an OPTIONS request.=20

5.9 Security Considerations=20
  =20
  The security requirements of [2] apply to the REFER method.=20
  =20
  This mechanism relies on providing contact information for the=20
  referred-to resource to the party being referred (the transfer-target=20
  and transferee in a transfer). Care should be taken to provide a=20
  suitably restricted URI if the referred to resource should be=20
  protected.=20
  =20
  Care should be taken when implementing the logic that determines=20
  whether or not to accept the REFER request. A UA not capable of=20
  accessing non-SIP URLs SHOULD NOT accept REFER requests to them.=20
  Unless the UA has good reason (perhaps as part of an as yet undefined=20
  application), it SHOULD NOT accept REFERences to SIP URLs for methods=20
  other than INVITE. =20

6  Using REFER to achieve Call Transfer=20
  =20
  A REFER can be issued by the Transferor to cause the Transferee to=20
  issue an INVITE to the Transfer-Target. Note that a successful REFER=20
  transaction does not terminate the session between the Transferor and=20
  the Transferee. If those parties wish to terminate their session, they =

  must do so with a subsequent BYE request. The media negotiated between =

  the transferee and the transfer target is not affected by the media=20
  that had been negotiated between the transferor and the transferee. In =

  particular, the INVITE issued by the Transferee will have the same SDP =

  body it would have if he Transferee had initiated that INVITE on its=20
  own. Further, the disposition of the media streams between the=20
  Transferor and the Transferee is not altered by the REFER method.=20
  Agents may alter a session's media through additional signaling. For=20
  example, they may make use of the SIP hold re-INVITE [2] or the=20
  conferencing extensions provided by this framework.=20
  =20

6.1 Unattended Transfer=20
  =20
  Unattended Transfer consists of the Transferor providing the Transfer=20
  Target's contact to the Transferee. The Transferee attempts to=20
  establish a session using that contact and reports the results of that =

  attempt to the Transferor. The signaling relationship between the=20
  Transferor and Transferee is not terminated, so the call is  =20
  recoverable if the Transfer Target cannot be reached. Note that the=20
  Transfer Target's contact information has been exposed to the=20

  Transferee. The provided contact can be used to make new calls in the=20
  future.=20
  =20
  The diagrams below show indicate the first line of each message. All=20
  messages in a particular diagram share the same Call-ID. In these=20
  diagrams, media is managed through reINVITE holds, but using other=20
  mechanisms (mixing multiple media streams at the UA or using the=20
  conferencing extensions for example) are valid.=20

May I ask why SIP is being extended to include PBX
feature handling? Isn't this an example of creeping
featurism which could kill a protocol?

Fact is, good service centers also plan to support rotary phones. Hence,
"press 1 or say 'one'." In fact, the most foolproof way to handle a
multiservice IVR is to branch a good quality audio leg to that center. If
you have the horsepower to recognize 'one', then dtmf recognition is really
in the noise...

The discussion on SIP for appliances has been fascinating,
and many good points have been raised.  Use of SIP to CONTROL
appliances may or may not be the greatest thing since sliced
bread, but, unfortunately, falls outside of the SIP working
group charter:
"SIP is a text-based protocol, similar to HTTP and SMTP, for 
initiating interactive communication sessions between users. 
Such sessions include voice, video, chat, interactive games, 
and virtual reality." 

We encourage the authors of the draft to create a mailing list
for the subject.  They will be welcome to post an announcement
of such a list on the main SIP list.  If the discussion proves as
lively as it has been, you may consider asking for a BOF at the
next IETF meeting. 

Since we have a ton of work to accomplish that falls within the 
charter of the SIP WG, the chairs would like to cut off discussion
of this subject on the SIP list.  

We do not wish to curtail sip discussions that focus on devices 
that facilitate multimedia communications between users
(such as dedicated IP phones, kitchen-counter mail/web/sip boxes, 
set-top-boxes, and so on). These are within scope, and are encouraged.

The sip list is the appropriate venue for questions on sip itself.

Yes. They could all be registered as being contact addresses for the
same name, or different names, depending on who these devices represent.

If you register them all to the same name, yes.

Why not? Again, if these are registered as representing the same person,
sure, they might both ring.

The proxy can always do a sequential search. That does not require any
extensions.

I think we need to start distinguishing between the
session layer protocol and the application layer
protocols. I think that DTMF, message waiting or any
messages not related to session initiation or tear
down should not be in SIP.

However there is a huge demand for standardization of
the communication of events that are:
1-	application specific (IP Telephony) and 
2-	are either in session or out of session.

I believe we need to create an IPTelephony
Service/Application platform interface protocol.

This protocol will interface between a telephony
server running SIP signaling, Megaco Control or even
H.323 and the service / application platform that
needs the used input or user indication:

This protocol would be an application level protocol.
The application being "IPTelephony". It would be
independent of SIP and would handle all the event
signaling and function invocation needed by a service
platform.

Keep SIP simple and clean and address all the
application stuff in one place

Hi, Mike:

It would help if you could clarify the following:

1. What do we exactly mean by the IP Telephony (application)?
2. What is the relationship between the IP Telephony (application) and SIP?

Best regards,

Subject: Re: [SIP] DTMF and Universal Key Input


I think we need to start distinguishing between the
session layer protocol and the application layer
protocols. I think that DTMF, message waiting or any
messages not related to session initiation or tear
down should not be in SIP.

However there is a huge demand for standardization of
the communication of events that are:
1-	application specific (IP Telephony) and 
2-	are either in session or out of session.

I believe we need to create an IPTelephony
Service/Application platform interface protocol.

This protocol will interface between a telephony
server running SIP signaling, Megaco Control or even
H.323 and the service / application platform that
needs the used input or user indication:

This protocol would be an application level protocol.
The application being "IPTelephony". It would be
independent of SIP and would handle all the event
signaling and function invocation needed by a service
platform.

Keep SIP simple and clean and address all the
application stuff in one place

Everyone,

What does a does a server do if an isomorphic SIP INVITE arrives after a
call completes?

For example if, through a series of forking proxies, two isomorphic INVITEs
get generated destined for a single UAS. The path that the second INVITE
takes is such that it is delayed and arrives at the UAS *after* the call
initiated by the first INVITE has finished.

Does the UAS simply ignore the second INVITE? If so, this means that the UAS
would need to keep a record of all INVITEs it has received over X amount of
time. How long would the UAS need to store this information?

Thanks in advance,

Garret Wilson

My opinion is that where it is essential that two sip components
agree on how a feature is to be handled, then there should be
some kind of document that describes how that works, so that
interoperability can be achieved.  If the feature is solely implemented
in a single element, then it is not something we need to 
worry about.

Just because there needs to be a document does not imply a standards
track RFC.  Only things which are not achievable with existing SIP
methods might need extensions.  Other features might be covered in
other kinds of documents, Informational RFCs for example, or even
documents not in the IETF.

no.  to use the sip url, you must at the very least provide a host name
and 17148700861 is not a valid host name.

however, you can use the tel url (RFC 1806) to do this.

e.g. tel:17148700861

This sounds like a good idea -- we are working on creating a mailing list
(which will be announced shortly) and a web page.

However, I would like to make sure that whatever future path we take with
the appliances work, we are able to synchronize/coordinate with the rest of
the SIP WG work if needed.

Hopefully we can have a BOF at the next IETF and we can reach a good
agreement on how to move forward.

We will continue to monitor the SIP list for this type of discussion too,
because this also falls within our scope -- we do not wish to differentiate
between types of devices/appliances.

Thanks for enabling this subject/topic to be heard!

Subject: [SIP] some inconsistencies in SIP rfc
Sender: sip-admin@lists.bell-labs.com
Errors-To: sip-admin@lists.bell-labs.com
X-Mailman-Version: 1.1
Precedence: bulk
List-Id: IETF SIP Mailing List <sip.lists.bell-labs.com>
X-BeenThere: sip@lists.bell-labs.com

The foll. example is given in SIP rfc :
   v=0
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.anywhere.com
   c=IN IP4 host.anywhere.com
   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
   a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
   m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31
   a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000
   m=video 53000 RTP/AVP 32
   a=rtpmap:32 MPV/90000

The callee, Bob, does not want to receive or send the first video
stream, so it returns the media description below:

   v=0
   o=bob 2890844730 2890844730 IN IP4 host.example.com
   c=IN IP4 host.example.com
   m=audio 47920 RTP/AVP 0 1
   a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
   a=rtpmap:1 1016/8000
** m=video 0 RTP/AVP 31 ****** some payload value is specified
   m=video 53000 RTP/AVP 32
   a=rtpmap:32 MPV/90000

The above is the example specified in the SIP rfc, but its contradicting 
with the following statement in SIP rfc under Appendix B:

   If caller and callee have no media formats in common for a
   particular stream, the callee MUST return a session description
   containing the particular "m=" line, but with the port number
   set to zero, and no payload types listed.

Again the above statement "no payloads type listed" contradicts with the SDP 
rfc since its grammar does not allow the format list to be empty or blank. 
Its :
     media-field = "m=" media space port ["/" integer]
                    space proto 1*(space fmt) CRLF

This statement is incorrect. It will be fixed in the next revision of
the draft. A payload value must be specified, as per rfc2327. It doesn't
matter what its value is.

Lack of creativity does not seem to be a problem for the SIP WG. A surfeit
of creativity may in fact not be the WG's best interest, given the number of
things already on the plate. I have seen a number of protocol efforts
seriously damaged by having too many good ideas thrown in the pot (e.g.
HTTP, PPP, FDDI, VPIM).

I personally do not think Brian is out of line here.

Hi,

    In the Section 4.1 of the Instant Messaging draft ( =
draft-rosenberg-impp-im-00.txt) there is some inconsistency between the =
explaination text on message F4 and the actual message which follows the =
text. The text is as follows:

"The proxy receives this response, stripps off the top Via, and forwards =
to the address in the next Via, user1pc.domain.com, the result being =
message F4:"

which makes sense. However in the actual message F4 we seem to be =
removing the Contact instead of the top Via field. Please comment on =
this.

Regards,

Krishna G.

Hi,

- Message waiting info is not specific to IP telephony. It is equally 
relevant for email, voicemail, video, faxes, file sharing drop boxes, etc.

- MGCP, Megaco, and H.323 already have their own (different) ways of 
handling both DTMF and Message Waiting.  A unifying approach only works 
when all the the protocols share the need for a solution.

- We already have a BCP for SIP Interworking with the PSTN.  It seems that 
the WG has already taken a chunk of IP telephony under SIP's wing as a 
subset of the SIP solution space.

Becasue of these issues, it doesn't seem like a stretch to keep both DTMF 
and Message Waiting in scope.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

The philosophy of SIP call control is to create a small number of 
*primitives* that can be used to deliver a much larger number of features.

REFER  is a primitive which asks another UA to send a SIP request on the 
Referrer's behalf.  It can be used for "Transfers", but you can also use it 
for 3rd party desktop call control, and we will probably take advantage of 
the primitive to build collaborative applications (conferencing).

I estimate that we can get all the PBX features (past, present, and future) 
using three to five well-defined primitives.

Hope this helps.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Roy,

IP Telephony Applications are things like Voice Mail,
IVR, Call Center, or any new imaginative ones we can
come up with

I think that SIP is the session layer protocol that is
used to establish and tear down sessions or calls in
IP telephony. but it could be used to setup any
session for application other than voice or telephony.
SIP should not have application dependence.

Thanks for the reply. How would SIP, in itself, be
used to deliver such features as Group Pick Up,  Line
Appearance , Call Back and so on? Extensions to do
these would seem to be getting into the functioning of
the user agent and the definition of other agent
types.

Not really, like call park and group call pick up.

Call flows posted for the SIP WG and some available at
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/ cover such PBX functions.

The central call agent makes you have the PBX network all over
again, only this time over IP. With all the properties of
proprietary PBX's.

It would be of interest to make an inventory of advanced
features published for SIP and map them to existing PBX features
and finally to make a list of what PBX features make really
sense for SIP.

Hi,

You are right that most "features" will be implemented in the UAs.  They 
will only need to support the appropriate primitives, and have some way to 
invoke them in the propoer combination (probably a URI or URI-list), and 
code to render meaningful messages/status.

Specifically, several folks on the list have commented at various times on 
how to do Call Park and Pickup, Conferencing, Transfer, 3rd party call 
control, message waiting, etc.  Call queuing and forwarding are already 
built into the protocol.

thanks,
-rohan

For proxies - nothing. Once the state of the transaction is erased, this
will look like a brand new INVITE, and be proxied merrily on its way.

As for user agent servers, the choice is yours. The INVITE state machine
itself will force you to keep state around for 32 seconds. That should
cover a pretty hefty fraction of very late packets. If you want to
extend this timer to get those 10 9's of reliability, your choice. I'm
not to worried about this problem. Worst case the phone rings again, its
picked up, 200 OK is sent, no ACK ever comes, no one talks on the other
side, and you hang up. My phone at home sometimes rings and no one is
there.

I still find this text confusing, since it refers to second vias and
isn't really ordered according to what you would do. How about:

1. If sent-protocol indicates TCP, send the response using an existing
TCP connection to the source of the original request.

2. Otherwise, if the Via header field contains a maddr parameter,
forward the response to the address listed there,
using the port indicated in sent-by, or port 5060 if none is present.
If the address is a multicast
address, the response SHOULD be sent using the TTL indicated in the
ttl parameter, or with a TTL
of 1 if that parameter is not present.

3. Otherwise, if it is a receiver-tagged field (Section 6.46.2), send
the response to the address in the received
parameter, using the port indicated in the sent-by value, or using
port 5060 if none is present.

4. Otherwise, send the response to the address indicated by the
sent-by, using the port indicated by "sent-by", or port 5060 if none
is present.

Note that the response to a UDP request is NOT sent back to the port
from which the request came from.

This thread never reached any conclusion; there was a lot of discussion
and it would be nice to come to consensus.

Summary so far:

1. Seems there is consensus that we would like to be able to have a
single TCP connection for bidirectional media. The case of two
unidirectional tcp connections is easy and pretty much supported with
the current SDP model.

2. It was proposed that the INVITE could contain a port number even if
the UAC was going to open the connection to the UAS; this port would
indicate the source port used in the open. This was motivated by the
desire for the UAS to have a single server port, and thus distinguish
incoming tcp connections from different UACs on the same machine by the
source port.

I have a problem with including the source port in the outgoing request.
As Anders pointed out, this requires allocating a source port before a
connection is setup, which is going to be impossible in certain systems.

It would also be useful to allow both sides to try to connect, in the
case where one is behind a firewall, the result is that one of the
connection attempts will work and then that can be used. If both
connect, we could define a precedence rule for dropping one.

So, my proposal would be:

1. m line format stays as is
2. instead of AVP, its a new parameter which indicates TCP: AVP-TCP
3. the port number in the m line refers to the port it is listening on
for connections; this may be meaningless dependending on the next thing
4. we define a new attribute, tcp, with values of:
   active: the port number is meaningless and the UA sending this SDP
wishes to open the connection to the remote side
   passive: please open a connection to this port
   both: we should both try to open connections; the one opened to the
highest remote port takes precedence if both succeed. If the ports are
the same, the highest IP address.
   uni: we should both open tcp connections, and use both, each being
unidirectional (at least for RTP, RTCP would be sent back over the same
TCP connection I suppose)

I don't like using port zero since this overloads the meaning of port
zero defined by SIP (refusal of a stream).

You are the man! I think this ties everything together very well.

If the attribute is missing what should the assumed value be? I would argue
that it should be "uni" as this is most inline with the way SDP is written. 

I agree with regards to port 0, ie even if "active" is used the port must
not be zero (perhaps the discard port (9) could be a recommendation?).

Do we want/need to define two tcp profiles: one for non-RTP/normal tcp and
one for RTP/AVP/TCP ?

Cheers,

Robert.

Hi,

    =20
 Consider the following call scenario


  A                                   B

             INVITE
   ------------------------------------>

             401 (Unauthorized)
   <------------------------------------

             ACK
   ------------------------------------>

             INVITE with Authorization
   ------------------------------------->
        =20
             200 OK
   <-------------------------------------

             ACK
   ------------------------------------->


  When call is disconnected and  connected  later
  above things repeat even though caller MAY know that=20
  authorization is required each time. Caller MAY not have the=20
  proper nonce and other values  in order to authorize. In order
  to get those value caller MAY prefer to go through the above=20
  call  flow each time. Thus each time caller has a overhead of
  doing thing. Thus, is it  possible to do it in other way ?.=20

Thanks

CALLER::                               CALLEE::
INVITE					200 ok

v=0					v=0
c=IN IP4 127.80.1.112			c=IN IP4 127.81.2.113
......					......
m=audio 3241 RTP/AVP 0			m=??????????????
a=recvonly
m=vedio 3342 RTP/AVP 1 			m=vedio 3352 RTP/AVP 1

Now the callee has only two options with the first media stream that
he can accept or reject.

CASE 1 (ACCEPT)
   The response in place of the ??????????????? would be :
           m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 0 (since port no. does not have any sign.)
************************************************************************
Since the RFC says "For send-only streams, the address and port number have 
no significance and SHOULD be set to zero."
************************************************************************So, 
should i always specify a corres. "c=" for the above such as :
           c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0
    or
          m=audio 2134 RTP/AVP 0 (RTCP port ---according to bis)

CASE 2 (REJECT)
   if we follow the bis we won't have any problems since just putting
   the port to 0 will suffice but with the present RFC how will we
   inform the other side that we want to reject this media stream
   since port zero is sent when he accepts the media stream, would
   the address field in "c=" line be seen to check if its a
   reject or an accept i.e. whether address in c= is 0 or <>0
   corresponding to a port 0 in m= line.

Hi,

 =20
       Consider for e.g. an  INVITE request
 sent to the user B  from user A via one or=20
 more proxies. When user B receives  the=20
 request the last via header field is the=20
 address of the  user A.  Assuming this via
 header field  is not  encrypted, can it be used=20
 as a contact address by the user B  when =20
 sending  request message  to  user A ?


Thanks
Rafi Assadi H.M.

No. This is why we have Contact.

Works for me, although in 2. I'd prefer using the token TCP rather than
AVP-TCP. This really has nothing to do with any Audio Video Profile.
Unlike for RTP-over-UDP we're not aiming to tell the peer that this
connection is carrying a certain type of traffic. It just means we're
establishing a TCP connection, right?

Cheers,
Anders

I have more commentary as well, but this is an easy one: I also object to 
the AVP-TCP token for the same reason.  Adding "AVP" certainly doesn't add 
any useful information (there *is* no Audio-Video Profile for raw TCP of 
which I'm aware), and in fact is misleading since the likelihood that you 
will be using TCP to transport audio or video is quite remote.

More commentary will be forthcoming once the morning brain fog clears a bit...

The only problem I see in allowing a UAC to include a port number in the
m= line whilst using a=tcp:active attribute is that since people don't
want to use port 0 it is not clear whether the port number is meant to
be meaningful or not. This can be solved by specifying the special
uac-local-port-is-not-specified port to be 9. It will seem odd to
everyone who doesn't know that 9 happens to be the assigned port for the
Unix 'null' service, though.  I think we can safely assume that to be
most people.

Not that we really needed the ITU to grant us the right to use "TCP" as
a transport specifier in SDP.

Of course we do. The parameter mechanism is there to allow us to add
extra info to m= lines or to otherwise qualify them. We could try and
encode all this info info into the trnsport specifier but that's totally
pointless.

Earlier also i posted the query but it was not in readable format, So i have 
done some reformatting :-

CALLER::                               CALLEE::
INVITE                                 200 ok

v=0                                    v=0
c=IN IP4 127.80.1.112                  c=IN IP4 127.81.2.113
......	                               .......
m=audio 3241 RTP/AVP 0	               m=??????????????
a=recvonly
m=vedio 3342 RTP/AVP 1                 m=vedio 3352 RTP/AVP 1

Now the callee has only two options with the first media stream that
he can accept or reject.

CASE 1 (ACCEPT)
   The response in place of the ??????????????? would be :
           m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 0 (since port no. does not have any sign.)

************************************************************************
Since the RFC says "For send-only streams, the address and port
number have no significance and SHOULD be set to zero."
************************************************************************

So,should i always specify a corres. "c=" for the above such as :
          c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0
    or
          m=audio 2134 RTP/AVP 0 (RTCP port ---according to bis)

CASE 2 (REJECT)
   if we follow the bis we won't have any problems since just
   putting the port to 0 will suffice but with the present RFC how
   will we inform the other side that we want to reject this media
   stream since port zero is sent when he accepts the media stream,
   would the address field in "c=" line be seen to check if its a
   reject or an accept i.e. whether address in c= is 0 or <>0
   corresponding to a port 0 in m= line.

While I understand the concern, omitting the ability to specify the port 
because of the brain-damage in certain programming languages is a bit 
self-defeating.  I'm not ready to give up on that feature yet, especially 
when bind-before-connect *is* available in most environments.

Note that I'm not advocating that the UA be *forced* to specify an 
origination port (see my discussion down below).  But the designers of a 
system should be allowed to make this choice for themselves, knowing that 
there are tradeoffs in both directions.

As I mentioned in another email: AVP is meaningless at best, misleading at 
worst.  If we are going to specify the direction in an attribute, let's 
just use the "TCP" token that was defined for us by the T.38 Annex D work.

Note that you might want something like this for RTP-over-TCP, but that's a 
different subject, and it seems like you would want use a special token for 
that.

What if we were to define a port that is the equivalent of PORT_ANY? (which 
unfortunately is usually zero---and yes---I know there's no PORT_ANY in 
most socket headers :-) )  The UA wishing to be the active side of the 
connect can specify a port if possible, or by specifying PORT_ANY it 
denotes that it does not know from which port it will be originating the 
connect.

The SIP version of PORT_ANY could be 9 (discard, as Robert suggests), or 
maybe 65535.

re: using an attribute.  Do we really want to require that SIP ALP's forage 
into the attributes in order to do their job?  The reason I had originally 
suggested that we have several TCP tokens (in this case we could have 
TCP/BOTH, TCP/ACTIVE, TCP/PASSIVE, and TCP/UNI) was so that a SIP ALP would 
have everything it needed to know on the m= line.  I'm not stuck on either 
approach, but I wanted to make sure we understood the ramifications of each 
side.

>    passive: please open a connection to this port

"both" opens up a race condition if both succeed.  What if the "winning 
ticket" (highest port/address) gets connected later due to packet 
loss?  I.e., late enough that the other connection has already has some 
data in the pipe?

I don't see when this would ever be used except for RTP-over-TCP, in which 
case you probably want a unique token for that.  But my objection to this 
is not all that strong.

>I don't like using port zero since this overloads the meaning of port
>zero defined by SIP (refusal of a stream).

I agree, and it's unfortunate that it's in conflict with the natural desire 
to use PORT_ANY (0) for the purposes I list earlier.

Well yes, we're agreeing.  Although you snipped it out of your reply, I 
suggested the same thing: either port 9 or port 65535 as the equivalent of 
"I don't know what port I'm using".  I agree that port 0 in SIP already has 
other connotations and that it would be bad to overload it.

Didn't mean to infer anything of the sort.  I was just pointing out that 
TCP was there already, regardless of who put it there.

Yes, but I have three issues:

         1) A SIP ALP shouldn't need to have an in-depth knowledge of
            the media beyond that which is necessary to route it.  I.e.,
            a SIP ALP shouldn't need to know anything about the G.xxx
            codecs in order to do its job of firewall/NAT management.

         2) It seems like in other usage models, the m= line contains
            network endpoint data, and the a= line contains more detailed
            information about the media that will be flowing.  The
            current proposal blurs this separation.  I'll admit that
            TCP connection setup is a grey area in terms of media
            properties vs network properties, but I'm leaning towards
            the latter.

         3) If I'm remembering correctly, the m= line has a very simple,
            fixed format, whereas the a= line is much more open and
            extensible.  If a SIP ALP can get its routing information
            from the m= line it will reduce complexity.

If someone can point out existing media descriptions that would require a 
SIP ALP to have intimate knowledge of the a= line in order to manipulate a 
NAT/firewall, I'd be interested to hear it.  Barring that we will be the 
first to extend SDP such that this is required.

I'll also add that this is not a rapidly growing set of attributes we're 
talking about.  I.e., unlike codec technology and the AVP profiles, it 
doesn't seem like there will be a lot of new things to say about TCP 
connection setup in the future.

Correct. This is not something that is expressable in SDP, at least in
a single pass. The caller should probably accept the call with one of
sendonly or recvonly, and then do re-INVITE to add the stream in the
other direction.

I don't know of a specific definition of an ftp session within SDP;
seems easy to do.

The spec doesn't say. I think either will work, with a=sendonly being
the most correct thing.

The caller can cache the credentials and use them in any subsequent
requests to the same To field. It may turn out that the nonce has not
expired and thus the cached credentials work for the next call. If they
have expired, then the UAC will need to be rechallenged and can
automatically recompute the credentials with the new nonce.

Check draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-srcfilter-00.txt. The author proposes
an extension to the a=line which allows to specify source addresses.

I assume you mean the port number specified in bind()? You're saying
that 

s = socket()
bind(s, ...)
connect(s, ...)

does not work on some systems?

AVP makes sense iff the next layer is RTP, uses RTP profile (RFC
1890bis) payload types and the encapsulation is using the 2-byte message
delineation mechanism. Thus, this may be true for some TCP connections,
but not others.

This being the two two numbers/IP addresses advertised in SDP, i.e.,
this should not require any additional socket calls to find out.

Seems like a reasonable solution. Adding some explanatory detail as to
the socket API calls involved may prevent confusion as to what's meant.
As for the preconditions draft, having a table spelling out the
allowable combinations of active/passive/both/uni may be useful.

"both" is going to have funny results if there are one or 2 NATs on the
path... You should not rely on comparing the binary values of ports or
addresses. I thing that active/passive/uni provides a good match -- or
active/passive/both, leaving it to the app to decide which connection is
used for what purpose.

Fair enough, although based on a quick reading of the I-D, it would appear 
that a simple SIP ALP would not actually be required to understand the a= 
line described in the draft.  A *smart* SIP ALP could use it as an 
optimization (i.e., configure the firewall to filter the source addresses), 
but a simple SIP ALP could opt to let the UA do it, which is what happens 
anyway if there is no ALP in the path.

Since our presentation during the SIP WG meeting at the Pittsburgh IETF on 
"SIP for Appliances" there has been a lot of discussion on this topic on 
this mailing list. Per Brian Rosen's suggestion (see e-mail below), we have 
created a mailing list expressly for the discussion of this topic. The list 
is appliances@research.telcordia.com and you can subscribe by sending an 
e-mail to appliances-request@research.telcordia.com with the word 
"subscribe" in the *Subject* line of the e-mail.

We have also created an accompanying web page at 
http://www.research.telcordia.com/iapp/

The (initial) plan for the new appliances mailing list is to continue the 
discussion begun on this mailing list regarding the use of SIP for 
networked appliances. We plan to request a BoF at the San Diego IETF and 
submit several more Internet Drafts on this subject.

We welcome everyone to participate and especially hope that everyone 
involved with the SIP for Appliances threads on this mailing list join the 
new list.

Thanks,
-Stan

Brian,

The next call flows document, SIP Service Examples (based on what was
section 7 from draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt which uses Bye-Also) will
cover many of these issues, and will hopefully become an Informational
RFC.   The basic goal of the document will be to give examples of common
PSTN Class and PBX features using SIP.  The draft will use REFER and other
new methods and extensions.

Alan.

Yep, that was one of those "Informational RFCs" I was talking about.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
	Author(s)	: M. Handley, H. Schulzrinne, E. Schooler, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00.txt,.ps
	Pages		: 177
	Date		: 09-Aug-00
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

The informaional RFC is described as being concerned
with 'interoperability.' I assume that RFCs like this
will only be illustrative as to how these extensions
could be used to create different feature types. I do
not see it to be beneficial to the user or vendor for
the IETF to attempt to decide on the details of
feature operation and interaction.

I have some follow up questions about the 487 message handling at a Proxy
that was discussed on this thread.  

You mentioned that upon expiration of the Expires timer, a Proxy should not
send a 408 to the OUA until after the TUA responds with a 487.  This seems
to have a backwards computability problem.  If the TUA does not yet support
the 487, the Proxy will never receive the 487.  What timer should the Proxy
use for waiting for the 487 - a T1 Timer on the INVITE?  Upon expiration of
that timer, does the Proxy resend the INVITE?  If it resent the INVITE to a
TUA that didn't support the 487, the TUA would think this was a new call
request (at least prior to the bis draft).

Is there a new kind of timer to use for this case?   Upon expiration of that
timer, the Proxy would then send the 408.  There is no discussion of this in
the bis draft.

Also, in the case of a parallel proxy does the Proxy wait for all branches
to return the 487, or just the first one?

Thanks,
Kathleen

Ah right, I see.  I guess we'll have to kick of another timer,
in case the next downstream stateful-proxy/UA doesn't return a
487.  But that's no biggie.

Very sweet.

Yup -- works for me.

Well, Informational means Informational, and not Standard,
so you get what you asked for.

As the saying goes, we aren't the protocol police, so any
RFC we create can be violated with impunity. Of course, as a customer, 
I could always demand compliance to an Informational RFC if I wanted to.

Many of the examples show how features COULD be implemented,
but there are other ways to do them.  I worry some about 
features that require both a UA and a proxy server to agree on
how they are implemented, because I want a Brand X UA to work with
a Brand Y proxy server.  For that matter if it depends on two UAs
or two proxy servers, I want to mix and match them too.
However, at this time, I would not advocate trying to create a 
standards track RFC that defines how such features work.

In some cases, as with Transfer, a new method is needed.  The draft
addresses that need for Transfer, and I think it should be moved 
along to a standards track RFC.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
	Author(s)	: M. Handley, H. Schulzrinne, E. Schooler, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00.txt,.ps
	Pages		: 177
	Date		: 09-Aug-00
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Wasn't version 00 submitted prior to the Pittsburgh IETF?  Shouldn't
this be version 01?

If not, I'd like to request that the version number be incremented with
each update, so that we can know which version is being referenced.

Yes, I just contacted the I-D editor about this. Something seems to have
gone wrong.

That is indeed the normal procedure.

Henning,

I found a small discrepancy in 2543bis regarding the Contact header in the
INVITE message. 

Section 6.5 Contact states "INVITE requests MUST ... contain Contact
headers..."

Section 11.1 Caller Issues Initial INVITE Request states "A UAC MAY
optionally add a Contact header ..."

Which is the correct requirement here?

David

The latter, contained in the bis-01 version to appear tomorrow. (The I-D
announcement today is for the old, July 13th, version and should be
ignored.)

Jonathan, Do you actually like the fact that your phone at home rings and no
one is there? This is really annoying and will continue to grow with more
telemarketers using predictive dialing. It is not really an acceptable
side-effect of network conditions.

Henning S. And Scott P. have made some interesting comments to my post. Before I go about addressing their issues directly, I would like to make a few comments.

For user input:
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a microphone.
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a video camera.
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have keys or buttons.
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a smell detector.
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have some sort of weird detector (wink detector? emotion detector?) that we can't imagine. 
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that have all sorts of combibations of the above user input devices. 

And for user output:
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a speaker (or two). 
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a display. 
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a tactile transducer (vibrates,
makes bumps, gets fatter or taller).
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have a smell generator.
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that only have some sort of weird output mechanism (telepathy? brain socket connection?) that we can't imagine. 
In the future, there will be SIP terminals that have all sorts of combibations of the above user output devices. 

For Control:
In the future, there will be SIP UAs that reside in refrigerators and let you set the tempreature & find out if the door is open from anywhere. They will also let you know what the tempeature in your refrigierator is, and if the temperature drops below a limit you set, or if the supply voltage is low. 

In the future, there will be SIP UAs that reside in your home air conditioner that let you set the tempreature in your house, & find out if your door is open from anywhere. They will also let you know what the temperature in your house is, and if the temperature drops below a limit you set, or if the A/C supply voltage is low. 

In the future, there will be SIP UAs that reside in a baby monitor that let you hear, see, and smell your baby from anywhere. You will be able to talk to your baby and pehaps the baby will even be able to see (and smell?) you. keys on the remote monotor will help control the camera. There probably won't be any keys on the baby's terminal.

Of course, someone will have to figure out what a SIP "Universal Remote Control" will look like, to control all of these various gizmos, but that is a topic for another discussion.

The point is, that we cannot (and should not) know all of the kinds of media that SIP will be required to support today. We only need a mechanism to add new media types as necessary. Luckily, we already have that mechanism. It is called SDP. Now, we only need to define the media types we DO know today. 

Audio, Video, Keystrokes. These three media types are clearly widely used today, so a specific SDP session should be defined for each of these media. Luckily, two of the three have already been done. SDP already has definitions for video and audio sessions.

An important point here. We shouldn't try and combine different media types in one session. A single SDP session is intended for a single type of media. To be specific, we should not combine Video & Audio in a single session. We shouldn't combine Video and Keystrokes in a single session. We should not combine Audio and Keystrokes in a single session.

There is an important rationale behind this requirement. In an ideal world, there would be a method for determining the capabilities of a SIP terminal. A SIP UA could ask another UA just what capabilities it has. Some of the things you should be able to determine:
Is the UA is a human-interface device or an automation device?
If it is a human-interface device, then you should be able to determine what user input mechanisms it supports. 
Does it have Audio input (microphones)? If so, how many? What encoders are supported?
Does it have Video input (video cameras)? If so, how many? What encoders are supported?
Does it have Key input (keypad)? If so, how many keys? What labels are on the keys? 

If it is a human-interface device, then you should be able to determine what user output mechanisms it supports. 
Does it have Audio output capability (speakers)? If so, how many? What audio decoders are supported?
Does it have Video output (screens)? If so, what resolution and how many? What video decoders are supported?
Does it have tactile output (vibrator, who knows)? If so, what kind & how many? 

Unfortunately, SIP does not allow an explicit pre-determination of terminal capabilities today. However, it does have a try-and-see-if-it-works kind of determination, which is good enough for now.

The reason that you only want one media type per session is because when you use SDP to explicitly set-up a media session with a UA, that act implicitly "turns on" that specific media device. Therefore, when you use SDP to set-up a transmit audio channel from the remote device, you are essentially telling the microphone in that device to start transmitting it's output on that session. When you use SDP to set-up a transmit video channel from the remote device, you are essentially telling the video camera in that device to start transmitting it's output on that session. When you use SDP to set-up a keystroke session on a remote device, you are telling the remote device to start transmitting keystrokes from the keyboard on that session.

A terminal may have video, audio, and keys as potential user input mechanisms. For whatever reason, an application may only want to get audio from a terminal. The application may not care anything about the video or keystrokes. You don't want to force the application to receive video and audio when all it wanted was audio. You don't want to force the application to receive audio and keystrokes when all it wanted was keystrokes.

If you turn off a session, you turn off the audio, video, or keystroke transmitter driving that session. If two or more media types are combined in a single session, you restrict the capabilities of the application. If both audio and video are in a single session,  you won't be able to "turn on or off" only one media type . When you setup the combined channel, you essentially turn on both media transmitters. You can only turn on both the audio and video transmitters, not either individually. 

The same argument goes for keystrokes and audio. You should be able to set up a session that only carried keystrokes, or only audio. Otherwise, you prevent the application from efficiently dealing with it's requirements. 
This promotes bandwidth conservation. It also helps simplify applications. If you don't want the media, don't set up the session! 

Probably even more importantly, the application may require that audio, video and keystrokes to go to different places! This requirement will be key in implementing advanced applications, and if the media are all lumped together in one channel, you can't send them different places. There are lots of applications even today that need the keystrokes and the audio to go different places. Some applications just want the keystokes and nothing else. Some want video and nothing else. I have applications where I want a terminal's keystrokes to go one place, and the audio to go to three different places. I can conceive of applications where the audio goes one place, and the keystrokes go three different places. 

RFC 2833 specifies a method for combining DTMF tones (PSTN-specific keystrokes), an audio session, and other PSTN signaling events such as ringing and busy tones, in a single RTP session. While this architecture is good for the person that just wants to transport EVERYTHING that's in a PSTN session from one gateway to another, It may NOT be ok for those who want to implement general applications in the packet network.

Of course, we all know the problem that RFC 2833 is trying to address. The current low-data-rate (LDR) audio codecs (G.732 &G.729 to be specific) were not designed to accurately encode tones. These codecs were designed with a perceptual model of the human voice in mind. If the listener can understand the un-encoded speech, the codec was judged a success. None of the current crop of codecs will convert DTMF or other PSTN tones with enough accuracy to allow automatic detectors to reliably extract the original tones from the encoded/decoded audio stream.

These LDR codecs are being used to transport voice traffic over the packet network. However, with the LDR codecs, the end-to-end keystrokes were getting distorted to the point that they couldn't be detected! Many applications in the PSTN rely on the presence of DTMF in-band, end-to-end signaling, so the network engineers had to come up with a solution. 

To solve this problem, packet network engineers logically decided to take the tones "out-of-band", or at least out of the G.723/729 codec's "band". However, The out-of-band tones must have enough information to reconstruct a reasonably intact G.711 PCM waveform out of the LDR speech codec data, and the out-of-band tone data. The reconstructed G.711 data needed to be both legible to the human listener and with the correct tones for the automatic tone detectors in the PSTN. 

Transporting PSTN signaling over packet networks isn't a new problem. The H.323 protocol addressed this issue with the UserInputIntication messages in the H.245 session. The RFC 2833 designers have done even a better job of designing a solution to the PSTN transport problem, using RFC 2833.

This DTMF transport problem sort of LOOKS like the keystroke-as-media problem that I have been describing. However there are significant differences in the requirements (and hence differences in the potential solutions) in the two problems.

The key differences:

Audio or not? 
RFC 2833 focuses on transporting DTMF signals over a packet network for re-construction of the tones in the PSTN. RFC 2833 assumes that the stuff it will be carying are still audio signals, but just special types. Also, it is assumed that the stuff will all eventually have to be re-combined, hopefully with nearly the same charateristics as the original waveform. As such, detailed information about the tone frequencies, levels, duration, cadence, and time reference to the concurrent audio stream, are all required to be in the transported data.

For keystrokes-as-media, the assumption is that the keystrokes are just that - keystrokes. No tones, no freqencies, no levels, no requirements for resynchronization, just which key was pressed. At the most, you may need a duration indication (key-on, key-off), but this charateristic would depend on whether the terminal device supported key duration.

I quote from section 3.1 of RFC 2833:
"If an end system is directly connected to the Internet and does not need to generate tone signals again, time alignment and power levels are not relevant. These systems rely on PSTN gateways or Internet end systems to generate DTMF events and do not perform their own audio waveform analysis. An example of such a system is an Internet interactive voice-response (IVR) system.   

In circumstances where exact timing alignment between the audio stream and the DTMF digits or other events is not important and data is sent unicast, such as the IVR example mentioned earlier, IT MAY BE PREFERABLE TO USE A RELIABLE CONTROL PROTOCOL RATHER THAN RTP PACKETS (my caps). In those circumstances, this payload format would not be used."

So according to the authors of RFC 2833, the DTMF in RTP scheme they define isn't necessarily the best protocol to carry events such as standard keystrokes that don't need to be time-aligned, or have specific power levels or have frequencies. 

Terminal Generalization: 
RFC 2833 assumes that the originating device is a PSTN phone (no self-respecting packet terminal would generate tones when it's keys were pressed). 2833 doesn't address the issue of what happens when someone presses the keys on a SIP terminal, or a PC running a SIP session. Well, it DOES say something on the subject:

"(By using RFC 2833) an Internet end system such as an "Internet phone" can emulate DTMF functionality without concerning itself with generating precise tone pairs and without imposing the burden of tone recognition on the receiver."     

So RFC 2833 recognizes the fact that a SIP terminal could send RFC 2833-compliant RTP streams to a PSTN device (presumably through a gateway), if it needs to really tightly control the delivery of the tones. The device would then rely on the gateway to generate the actual tones in the PSTN. Of course, if the packet device DIDN'T need to tightly control the key input presented to a PSTN device, and it DIDN't need precice synchronization with an audio stream, it potentially could use a much simpler key input protocol to send keystrokes to the gateway. 

What should be done when a SIP terminal is connected to another SIP device, and all they want to do is send keystrokes back and forth? This will be a common requirement where the device is a SIP UA in a remote-controlled appliance that only needs keystrokes for control. Should we use RFC 2833 to send the keystrokes from the control device to the remote appliance? 

This means you need the RTP protocol. You need to calculate RTSP stats. You need sequence numbers and time stamp alignment with the RTP audio (remember, there isn't any audio in this application). You need to repeat the keystroke packet every 50ms until the key is released. What happens if the keystroke duration is unknown (or is a don't care)? How do you implement redundancy when the keystroke duration is less than the repeat rate?  Do we need all this stuff just to get keystrokes?

Probably the most common keystroke scenario today is a person interacting with a IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. In the PSTN, you automatically get a two-way audio connection when you connect a call. However, in most of the today's IVR scenarios, the IVR only needs an audio path FROM the IVR TO the caller, to deliver prompts. The IVR doesn't care about audio coming from the caller. It can do without it. All it cares about is what keys the caller presses. 

In the PSTN, the audio is delivered to the IVR systems whether they wanted it or not, since that was the only way that keystrokes (DTMF) could get to the IVR. In a packet network, the application server should have the option to NOT have audio delivered to it - just keystrokes. This would save bandwidth in the network, and save protocol processing horsepower on the IVR/server.

Now, just because the IVR system doesn't need to see the audio stream doesn't mean that the caller won't be transmitting audio streams. Many applications (calling card, conferences) will have the caller's terminal sending its audio to other places, just not to the IVR. Or, the caller may need to send his audio AND keystrokes to the IVR, but just audio (no keystrokes) to other places. Or the keystrokes need to go other places. Or, Or, Or.

In the above example, the IVR/server in the network may handle thousands of SIP sessions, but all of them could be just keystroke input sessions. This occurs any time the application server is the control node for applications that involve large numbers of two or three-way calls (calling card, find-me, record/log, etc.). The application server doesn't actually need any of the audio or video streams, as the audio & video streams are going to the various participants as they communicate with each other. However the server needs to know about all of the keystrokes from any of the participants, as that is the method that this application uses to let the participants indicate what function is to be performed by the application.

In this scenario, you don't want too heavyweight of a protocol for the keystrokes, as that will limit the number of keystroke sessions that a single server could handle. The simpler the keystroke protocol, the more sessions a single server could handle. If I DO need to receive audio for recording or speech recognition purposes, I will probably send that stream to some other device (media recording/storage server, speech regognition server) in the network, not the keystroke server.

The important issue here is that applications residing in the packet network should be able to get simple keystroke media messages (no frequencies, no levels, no timestamps) from the devices on the other end of the SIP session whether the originator of the keystroke was a SIP terminal, A SIP phone, a SIP remote controller, a PC, or a PSTN phone. It should't be a requirement for the device to support audio or video streams just to send keystrokes. 

So, in summary:
1) RFC 2833 is intended for a very specific task - transporting audio signals that would normally be destroyed by speech codecs over a packet network. This task is complex and exacting - requiring a powerful protocol such as RTP with multiple transport components to implement effectively. RFC 2833 should be used only by gateways to transport PSTN signaling between gateways, so PSTN traffic can be routed over a packet network. RFC 2833 is not the appropriate protocol for SIP-terminal-to-PSTN or SIP-terminal-to-SIP-terminal keystroke transport. 

2) When all you have is a simple remote-control device with a small screen and 15 buttons (no mike or speaker), RFC 2833 seems a fairly heavyweight protocol just to carry keystrokes over a SIP session to the controlled device. This is particularly true if the transmitting and receiving devices are both in the packet network. We would still like to use SIP as the session initiation, but we need s simple, reliable protocol for the keysroke transport. This is also suggested in section 3.1 of RFC2833. A similar requirement was discussed previously for application servers in a packet network that need just keystroke input. Perhaps SCTP?

3) If a SIP device in the packet network needs to recieve keystroke information from a device in the PSTN, the SIP device will use SDP to set up a keystroke session with the gateway that is a proxy for the PSTN device. The gateway will be responsible for converting DTMF signals into the simple keystroke protocol for the SIP device.

4) If a SIP device in the packet network needs to send keystroke information to a device in the PSTN, the gateway will use SDP to set up a keystroke session with the SIP device. The gateway will be responsible for converting the simple keysroke protocol from the SIP device into DTMF signals for the PSTN device.

So what are the requirements for a keystroke media transport protocol?

We need keystroke delivery reliability. You can imagine what would happen if, when the bank automation system asked you to type the amout of the bill payment, you typed $180, but it thought you said $980. Or, if the remote-controlled A/C heard 99 degrees instead of 79.

We need sequencing reliability. You can imagine what would happen if, when the bank automation system asked you to type the amout of the bill payment, you typed $180, but it thought you said $810. Or, if the remote-controlled A/C heard 97 degrees instead of 79.

We need simplicity. The simplicity of SIP will allow keystroke mechanisms to be placed on all kinds of ultra-simple wireless remote devices, as well as high-density keystroke-detection servers. These devices will not necessarily support any audio or video media. You need a simple, reliable protocol that doesn't take much processing power, yet meets all of the transport requirements.

We need duration. If the protocol is reliable, all you need is a key-on and key-off messages as a standard mechanism for all key indications.

We need standardization. Most devices with keys will probably have a numeric pad. When you press a 'one' key on the SIP phone, it should give the same key media message as when you press a 'one' key on a PC, or a Cell Phone, or a SIP-based remote control device.

Certainly, some applications (those that use a device that has both keys and a microphone) will want to give the user an option for speech or keys for user input. Other applications (that use a device with only keys, or only a mike, or that don't want to pay for speech recognition) will not want to give the user any options for input. The last part of Scott's statement is what I particularly disagree with. The information doesn't need to be encoded as "similarly as possible". How do you encode a single key event similarly to 5,000-10,000 bytes of audio? For that matter, why would you want to? 

Scott:

http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/002002.html


The application provider may elect to have the keystroke "1" mean "no" or "stop" or "begin launch sequence" or something else. How could you tell the device to make the keystroke "1"  give a response that is "identical" to some spoken word or phrase? This model could only be implemented if speech recognition was implemented in the terminal device AND there was some protocol to explain to the terminal that the phrase "begin launch sequence" should send the same message as pressing the "one" key. I don't think that all of the terminal providers are planning to embed speech recognition in their terminals, and I haven't seen any proposals for a protocol to provide a "matching" mechanism like this supposes. 

Wouldn't it just be easier to have the "one" key ALWAYS sent a "one-key-pressed" message when it was pressed, and the "two" key ALWAYS send a "two-key-pressed" message, no matter what kind of device you have? When a word or phrase is spoken into the microphone, wouldn't it be easier to just send the few-thousand bytes of data representing the speech, rather than trying to convert the thousands of bytes into a single "he-said-stop" or a "he-said-begin-launch-sequence" message? The application should sort this kind of stuff out, not the terminal device.
 
More from Scott's post........
>If you need the keypress to be transported along the signaling 
>path, then you also need the "yes" to be transported along the 
>signaling path. And the encoding should also be as similar as
>possible, since the information to be encoded and transported is similar.

This depends highly on the application. In applications where you want keystroke/speech duality (every keystroke has an equivalent spoken phrase) your statement that both media types be sent along the same path has some validity. However this will be the exception, not the rule in future aplications. 

Keypads are useful for pre-defined entry and menu selection that require high reliability. Speech is useful for making selections across more than a few possibilities (what city are you going to?) where the utility is worth the lower reliability (more re-prompting) and higher cost of speech recognition. Applications that my company is developing today, use keys for input in certain situations, speech input for other situations, and "press-or-say-one" dual-input for even other situations. We certainly don't want the keypad to put out the same thing that the microphone does. 

In many cases, the two media types (speech & keystrokes) go to entirely different devices in the network for handling. The key-input-handling server can handle tens-of-thousands of simultaneous keypress event sessions. The voice recognition device can handle a few tens of simultaneous recognition sessions. I will tell the device to send its keystrokes to my keystroke server. I will tell the device to send its audio to one (of many) of my speech recognition servers. NO WAY should those different media-type streams be "in the same path". Or look the same.

More from Scott's post........
>After some DTMF, the session can be modified so that the call is
>transferred to another host which can handle the proper audio codecs.

No, I DON'T want to transfer the call to another host that can handle the proper codecs. I want to leave the key input session going to my key-input server, and I want to RE-INVITE just his AUDIO session to a speech recognition server, or to a different SIP endpoint to which I happen to have the port address. 

I will leave the key-input media session attached to the key-input server so the user can communicate via keystrokes to me, while I RE-INVITE his audio stream all over the place (multicast, multi-unicast, x-cast, you-name-it-cast) depending on the application. I don't wan't his keystrokes going all over the place, just like I don't want to see his audio coming to me.

Occasionally, I may set up an audio (or video) session with the caller to apprise him of his choices he has with the key input. Or I may set up a second audio channel (first channel is going to some other participant) to my speech reco server so he can speak his choices rather than using key input. Whatever fits the application best.

You're right. Keyboards will come in all shapes an sizes. There will be 300-key Katakana keyboards. There will be Braille keyboards. There will be 101 key keyboards. there will be European keyboards. There will be 20 key- keyboards, there will be 12-key keboards. There will be keyboards with only one BIG key smack in the middle. There will be soft keyboards that will allow you to specify the number of keys and the labels for each one (using SIP perhaps?).  

Not all of these devices will want or need speech recogniton. However, unless the device is single-functioned, ALL of these devices must have SOME way for a user to indicate a 10-digit phone number or a URL for addressing purposes. 

Some devices will use speech recognition for addressing. Some will not. Those that can't or won't accept the costs of speech reco will still have to have some method of indicating an address at a minimum. I will be willing to bet that that method will include at a minimum, a set of 10 numeric keys and an ENTER and DELETE (or equivalent) button. The keyboard may have a thousand other keys, but it WILL have numerics.

I expect that any device that can connect to the public data network will require a minimum 12-key numeric pad to indicate addresses, although alpha URLs would be a problem. I expect that popular websites will start adding 10-numeric-digit URLs to allow portable devices to enable access from simple wireless devices. Portable devices that don't want to use speech recognition, will invaribly have keys. The 12-digit keypad will be with us for a long time, I think.

Why tie keys to SIP? Because keystrokes are a terminal media element just like video or audio. Video & Audio are in SIP. Perhaps we should ask, why were keystrokes left out of SIP? Or a better question, why is there not a keystroke media session defined in SDP like there is for audio & video? RFC 2833 could be considered a first pass at the definition of a keystroke transport mechanism. Perhaps this discussion should be taking place in the SDP working group.

Henning:
>I don't want to SUBSCRIBE to the keyboard 

Neither do I. I want a SDP SESSION for that keyboard, just like I have a SDP session to a microphone and an SDP session to a video camera. I don't want a SUBCRIBE or NOTIFY mechanism for keystokes. Nor do I want to send keystrokes in the InfoMethod message. I want to be able to multicast, unicast, re-invite keystroke sessions just like you do audio and video. SUBSCRIBE & InfoMethod can't multi-unicast my keystrokes.

Henning:

I don't know how you would re-invite a telnet session, or request a multi-unicast of the telnet session. In any case, my simple wireless remote control already has SIP on it to locate the refrigerator in my house over the public data network. No reason to put the Telnet protocol on that little thing if all I need is a simple keystroke to be sent to the refrigerator. Just SDP-up a keystroke session with the refrigerator, and set the temp to 38 degrees.

Henning:

Agreed. There is no doubt that RFC 2833 has the capability to be a keystroke transport protocol. It has some of the appropriate charateristics. The main plus for RFC 2833 is that it is an SDP session! This means that it can be stopped, re-directed, multi-unicasted, and all of the useful things that we want to do with keystrokes. It also, with the addition of a reliability mechanism, could become a reliable transport.

The real questions are: Is RFC 2833 the appropriate protocol to send keystrokes in a packet network? 

Is RFC 2198, which is proposed as a potential mechanism for reliable delivery of keystrokes in RFC 2833, REALLY reliable enough? 

Is the processing overhead required for implementing RFC 2833 and RFC 2198 appropriate for a simple remote key entry device that just needs a simple, reliable keystroke delivery mecahnism? That device doesn't have audio, no synchronization requirements, no RTCP, just reliable keys.

Is RFC 2833 appropriate for a high density keystroke server (see above)?

Will RFC 2833 let me tell a device that is sending me audio and keystrokes, to stop sending me audio but keep sending keystrokes (or vice-versa)? I can certainly tell a device that is sending me audio and video to stop sending me one, but keep sending me the other, using re-invite. Shouldn't the mechanism for both of these start-stop procedures be the same (re-invite a media session)?
 
Can you use RFC 2833 to send keystrokes to one place, and audio three (different) place?
 
Can you use RFC 2833 be used to send audio one place, and keystrokes three (different) places?  

So, these are the issues.

Stay Tuned.

The SIP specification states that, "Two requests or responses are defined to
be isomorphic for the purposes
of this document if they have the same values for the Call-ID, To, From and
CSeq header fields."

The phrase, "same values" seems to be undefined, which means that what it
means for two header fields to be equal is unspecified. For example, if two
"From" strings are identical except that the second one specifies a port of
":5060", do these two value have the "same value?"

sip:jane@doe.com
sip:jane@doe.com:5060

(After all, since 5060 is the default SIP port, the first SIP-URI really has
the same port as the second.)

Cheers,

Garret

I just realized that the latest spec explains how to compare URIs. The
question remains that, if two URI's are equal yet not identical in string
format, are two From headers (for example) which contain these two URIs
considered to have the "same value" as per the definition of isomorphic?

Without wishing to get into the details of this post, I would point people
at RFC 2793 "RTP Payload for Text Conversation" which may be relevent.

Besides the philosophical arguments, can somebody please succinctly and
technically characterize why RTP transport of digits does not work or is
not sufficient, given that

- sending a 'tones' RTP packet incurs no more (and plausibly less)
overhead at sender or receiver than a SIP packet

- sending keyboard input as envisioned here has nothing to do with
session setup or control or signaling

- RTP with redundancy is at least as reliable as SIP transport

- REFER and 3pcc can be used to redirect RTP streams wherever they are
needed, either separate from or jointly with the audio stream

- a number of implementations already support the RFC 2833 mechanism -
why should they support another mechanism?

As Colin points out and has been raised on the list before in a
different context, if we're into text communications (full keyboard
set), the RTP text payload type may also be appropriate. 

Thank you.

>I quote from section 3.1 of RFC 2833:

>Terminal Generalization:

Why shouldn't SIP UA to PSTN interworking use RFC 2833?  The requirements 
for DTMF "events" synched with audio are the same.  I haven't seen a single 
good argument why SIP UA with an active audio stream with a PSTN gateway 
shouldn't use RFC 2833.

hmm,  buttons and a display, sounds like a web browser to me, and very much 
out of the scope of the Session Initiation Protocol.

How is this simpler than using RFC 2283?

With AVT, you just receive the RTP packet, figure out what the associated 
DTMF is, and optionally check that the length/volume is above a threshold.

Again, how is this simpler?

With AVT, just send the packet with a default duration and volume.

If all you are saying is that RFC 2283 is hard, and that you want to build 
a new protocol do transport keystrokes, or DTMF events, I sincerely doubt 
you will be able to convince me that building, documenting, and testing 
this new protocol is *easier* than just implementing

>So what are the requirements for a keystroke media transport protocol?

Has anyone thought about why we really want *raw* keyboard input?  It 
sounds like what you really want, is something like VoXML.  Send a document 
that associates certain collections of input (keyboard, DTMF, voice, 
smell-detector, etc) with some action or URL.

Based on your examples, I could send a document to my phone which 
represents an IVR tree, and after navigating through 7-layers of IVR hell, 
it executes the right URL (which refers me to an appropriate agent).

Likewise, I could collect the desired temperature of my house, and then 
send a HTTP POST with the collected data to my home control system.

Before anyone chides me for being insensitive to the processing/memory 
requirements of portable devices, I think this is quite reasonable on 
devices with 1MB of RAM or less.

Thoughts,

There's been far more email exchanged than it would take to implement
this. To remedy this, let me provide a basic C implementation skeleton,
free of charge.

typedef struct {
    unsigned int version:2;   /* protocol version */
    unsigned int p:1;         /* padding flag */
    unsigned int x:1;         /* header extension flag */
    unsigned int cc:4;        /* CSRC count */
    unsigned int m:1;         /* marker bit */
    unsigned int pt:7;        /* payload type */
    unsigned int seq:16;      /* sequence number */
    u_int32 ts;               /* timestamp */
    u_int32 ssrc;             /* synchronization source */
} rtp_hdr_t;  

typedef struct {
   unsigned int event:8;
   unsigned int e:1:
   unsigned int r:1:
   unsigned int volume:6;
   unsigned int duration:16;
} tone_hdr_t;

struct {
  rtp_hdr_t rtp;
  tone_hdr_t tone;
} packet;

Sending:
  (setting other constant RTP header fields omitted)

  packet.rtp.ts = whatever;
  packet.rtp.seq = seq++;
  packet.rtp.tone.event = 9;   /* for the digit '9' */
  packet.rtp.tone.e = 1;       /* one digit per packet here */
  packet.rtp.tone.volume = 0;  /* we don't care */
  packet.rtp.tone.duration = whatever;  /* however long the user pressed
the key */

Receiving just unpacks this. Transmit using TCP for reliability, if you
like, or add redundancy for an additional two hour programming exercise.

Hi Henning,

> - sending keyboard input as envisioned here has nothing to do with
> session setup or control or signaling

I would argue that certain DTMF actions do have some effect over session
control - the classic example is triple star or long pound on calling card
systems. In my mind it is these class of actions that are the driving the
need for DTMF to be "split off" to one (or more perhaps) application servers
(in addition to the voice media endpoint!!).

The need for and method of forking the DTMF has of course has been the
eternally revisited sticking point. 

Am I missing your point?

Looking at the cc-transfer draft I can't see how this relates to solving the
above probem as it relates to DTMF streams (and DTMF does not seem to be
mentioned anywhere). Can you provide any more specific pointers ?

I sorry to ask _again_ but are you asserting that you don't need to send the
DTMF to multiple entities (voice endpoint and IVR application server)? If
not how are you proposing to solve the above classic problem? 

Thanks,

Robert.

It's not signaling in the VoIP sense. That these keys happen to have
consequences for the call is no different than if I were to use a web
browser and HTTP to somehow manipulate the call (indirectly invoking
some SIP action, in our context). This does not mean that HTTP is
suddenly a signaling protocol that should be carried in SIP.

One mechanism to 'split off' DTMF is to simply do an INVITE for the same
call, different call leg, where the SDP only allows 'tones'. Another,
more transparent one, is to have any box near the audio destination copy
the relevant RTP bits to whoever needs them. (This would be the address
specified in the SDP.)

Good point. Perhaps we should just combine both & uni (to make both an
optimization of uni). Ie, a UA is free to send over either tcp connection
which successfully connects; received packets from either (successful) tcp
connection should be treated identically. This also makes things simpler
which is also a bonus.

I still beleive that both a tcp and a RTP/AVP-TCP SDP profile will have
their uses. For instance, Henning just mentioned using reliable RTP
text/digit transport through TCP in another stream.

Sorry, I meant to reply to this a while back.

This is with regards to the telephone-subscriber ambiguity (again) 
(eg sip:ABCD;telparam=telvalue@gateway.com;user=phone).

Was the conclusion that
a) an unescaped '@ is allowed in a parameter as long is it is not ambiguous.
(ie, sip:ABCD;telparam=telvalue@gateway.com;toad=dog@cat;user=phone is ok)
or
b) '@' must always be escaped in parameter names and values.

I personally feel the latter is safer and I'm not sure if your reply is
supporting this viewpoint.

If that is the case then won't '@' also have to be removed from
param-reserved ?

Robert.

At the SIP bakeoff, a colleague had a conversation with one of the
co-authors of the 183 Session Progress draft.

He (the co-author) informed us that 183 is meant to be used when the remote
UA wants to provide 
some other, unknown message/signal - and _not_ simply remote ringback.

180 with an SDP body should be used for that purpose.

This came as quite a surprise as it seems to be at odds with RFC2543 which
makes no mention about the validity or handing 180 with SDP and states that
183 SHOULD include an SDP for session progress tones (or announcements).
[Without defining session progress tones.]

Even the 183 draft seems to only associate 180 with local alerting.

At the bakeoffs 183 seems to have been implemented widely for remote
ringback.

Can anyone shed some light on this?

Robert.

@ is a reserved character (being a separator with syntactic
significance).
Reserved characters must be escaped. I'm not sure from what it must be
removed since it doesn't appear in any explicit listing of unreserved
characters. 

unreserved    = alphanum | mark
      mark    = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" |
                      "(" | ")"

hnv-unreserved  = "[" | "]" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "+" | "$"

Ok right. Good we all agree. Sorry, I was interpreting param-reserved as the
list of reserved URL characters (RFC2396) allowed (unescaped)in the
parameter field (althought I guess you would have called it be
param-unreserved in that case).

Robert.

Hi

  I have a question on the cc draft.

In section  5.2.2     Variation 2 : Protects transfer target

Here in the call flow, when the transferor sends the REFER 
to transfer target, it uses a Call-ID of 2, to tie the REFER 
with the previous Invite sent. But when the transfer target
 sends an invite to the transferor, it uses a Call-ID
of 2, how would the transferor know that this is the call with
Call-ID of 1, that is on hold waiting to be transfered, and 
not a totally new call.

  This information may be desired, since the user may not want to
answer another call at this point of time?

Thanks
Jana

The rfcbis (Aug. 06 from http://www.cs.columbia.edu/sip) states that 180 is to indicate that the some attemp is made to alert the called party while 183 is to indicate 'progress of the call which is not otherwise classified' (p.62). So the distinction between 180 and 183 seems clear in rfcbis. Maybe there is still a little room left to exactly define the 180 and 183 semantics, but if it is certain that a called party is located and alerting is being applied successfully, I think 180 should be used. If it is not certain, 183.

Hi,

>The SIP specification states that, "Two requests or responses are defined >to be isomorphic for the purposes of this document if they have the same >values for the Call-ID, To, From and CSeq header fields."

>The phrase, "same values" seems to be undefined, which means that what it

Yes.

That is correct.

Henning,

While everyone else has been arguing about how or why one
should "smell" the keypad on their phone ;) I've been reviewing
draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-01.txt and have come across the
following minor edits to the ABNF and related text:


Section 2. SIP Uniform Resource Locators:

    delete

    <  tag-param       = "tag=" UUID
    <  UUID            = 1*( HEX | "-" )

    or replace with

    >  tag-param       =  "tag=" token

    and delete same from Section 6.24 From:

        Section 6.24 From:
            from-param  =  tag-param | generic-param
        <   tag-param   =  "tag" "=" token

        Section 6.43 To:
            to-param  =  tag-param | generic-param

In Section 3 SIP Message Overview:

    add Call-Info header lines to general-header syntax:

        general-header   =  Accept               ; Section 6.6
                         |  Accept-Encoding      ; Section 6.7
                         |  Accept-Language      ; Section 6.8
                         |  Call-ID              ; Section 6.12
    >                    |  Call-Info            ; Section 6.13
                         |  Contact              ; Section 6.14
                         |  CSeq                 ; Section 6.20

In Section 4.1 Request-Line:

    absoluteURI should be defined or reference [RFC2068] Section 3.2.1.

In Section 4.3.1 SIP Version:

    add ABNF:

    >  SIP-Version = "SIP/2.0"

In Section 6.13 Call-Info:

    <  Call-Info   =  "Call-Info" ":" # ( "<" URI ">" *( ";" info-param )

    has imbalanced parentheses and should be changed to:

    >  Call-Info   =  "Call-Info" ":" # ( "<" URI ">" *( ";" info-param ) )

In Section 6.14 Contact:

    qvalue should be defined here or RFC2068 Section 3.9 referenced.
    delta-seconds should be defined here or RFC2068 Section 3.3.2 referenced.

In Section 6.16 Content-Encoding:

    <  tokens. See [3.5] for a definition of the syntax for content-coding.

    should read

    >  tokens. See [H3.5] for a definition of the syntax for content-coding.

In Section 6.17 Content-Language:

    <  See [H14.12]

    should be changed to 

    >  See [H14.13]

In Section 6.21 Date:

    <  See [H14.18] for a definition of rfc1123-date. Note that unlike

    should read

    >  See [H14.19] for a definition of rfc1123-date. Note that unlike

In Section 6.28 MIME-Version:

    <  See [H19.4.1].

    should read

    >  See [H19.4.7].

In Section 6.30 Priority:

    <  other-priority     token

    is missing a definedas and should be changed to:

    >  other-priority  =  token

In Section 6.31 Proxy-Authenticate:

    should reference [H14.32] for ABNF syntax.

In Section 6.32 Proxy-Authenticate:

    should reference [H14.33] for ABNF syntax.

In Section 6.33 Proxy-Require:

    add following syntax definition:

    >  Proxy-Require = "Proxy-Require" ":" 1#option-tag

In Section 6.39 Server:

    <  syntax for this field is defined in [H14.38].

    should be

    >  syntax for this field is defined in [H14.39].

In Section 6.46.6 [Via] Syntax:

    maddr is never defined.

    ttl is redefined from Section 2: SIP Uniform Resource Locators: delete

    <  ttl              = 1*3DIGIT     ; 0 to 255

In Section 6.47 Warning:

    pseudonym should be defined here or RFC2068 Section 14.44 referenced.

In Section 15.1.1 The WWW-Authenticate Response Header:

    <  pgp-version       =  "version" "="
    <                       <"> digit *( "." digit ) *letter <">

    should read

    >  pgp-version       =  "version" "="
    >                       <"> digit *( "." digit ) *alpha <">

In Section 15.2 and 15.3:

    pgp-eparams is defined twice; suggest:

    <  Response-Key  =  "Response-Key" ":" "pgp" pgp-eparams
    <  pgp-eparams   =  1# ( pgp-version | pgp-encoding | pgp-key)

    replaced with 

    >  Response-Key  =  "Response-Key" ":" "pgp" pgp-ekparams
    >  pgp-ekparams   =  1# ( pgp-version | pgp-encoding | pgp-key)

In Section C.1 Basic Rules:

    <  CTL       =  %x00-1f | 0x7f ; (octets 0 -- 31) and DEL (127)

    should read

    >  CTL       =  %x00-1f | %x7f ; (octets 0 -- 31) and DEL (127)

I want to alert you people that text communications is still going to be very important.
Deaf/hearing impaired people will depend on text communications. I am deaf, so I have no need for voice communications (well..I can talk, but receiving voice is useless for me). I would love to see that any SIP device that is used/will be used has support for text. (if it links through a brain socket with my brain etc..then we can skip text  :-))
So..I'd like to see one clear agreement on how we implement it.
My knowledge into DTMF is very low. (I understand they are touch tone, if so, they are currently used by relay operators all over the world via the boudot protocol).

Subject: [SIP] DTMF


Besides the philosophical arguments, can somebody please succinctly and
technically characterize why RTP transport of digits does not work or is
not sufficient, given that

- sending a 'tones' RTP packet incurs no more (and plausibly less)
overhead at sender or receiver than a SIP packet

- sending keyboard input as envisioned here has nothing to do with
session setup or control or signaling

- RTP with redundancy is at least as reliable as SIP transport

- REFER and 3pcc can be used to redirect RTP streams wherever they are
needed, either separate from or jointly with the audio stream

- a number of implementations already support the RFC 2833 mechanism -
why should they support another mechanism?

As Colin points out and has been raised on the list before in a
different context, if we're into text communications (full keyboard
set), the RTP text payload type may also be appropriate. 

Thank you.

Skip says:
I will try to answer Henning and summarize my issues with RFC 2833.

Probably the most important issue is the requirement for a user agent
server in the network to redirect and replicate keystroke sessions just
as it would redirect and replicate audio or video streams.

Lets take this scenario:

1) A UA client (Term1) INVITES a UA server (Term2) and establishes an
audio session, a keystroke session, and a video session between Term1
and Term2 using SDP. Term1 is the transmitter of the media (keystrokes,
audio, video) in all three sessions. Term2 is the receiver of all media
in all sessions.

2) Term2 wishes to redirect Term1's audio media stream to a third party,
a UA server called Term3. Term2 RE-INVITES Term1's audio session to go
to Term3's port. However, the keystroke and video sessions transmitting
from Term1 to Term2 are NOT to be disturbed. We only want to redirect
Term1's audio session to Term3. All other sessions are to be left alone.
If audio and keystrokes are in the same SDP session, how do we do this?
Keystrokes need to have their own session in this scenario. RFC 2833
puts both media types in one session.

3) After we finish redirecting Term1's audio to Term3, we decide that a
fourth party needs to be involved (Term4). We want both Term1's audio
and Term1's keystrokes to be sent to Term4, but we DON'T want to disturb
the keystrokes and video going from 1-2, or the audio going from 1-3.
Term2 re-invites Term1 again, asking Term1 to replicate his keystroke
session and send a copy of the keystroke session to Term4. Term1 is now
essentially multi-unicasting his keystroke session to both Term2 and
Term4. Similarly, in the re-invite we ask Term1 to multi-unicast his
audio to Term2 and Term4. If audio and keystrokes are in the same SDP
session, how do we do this? Keystrokes need to have their own session in
this scenario.

I can go on in this vein, but you get the idea. Why do we require
keystrokes to be in the same session as the audio? Why did we pick the
audio session instead of the video session to carry keystrokes? Better
yet, why not give keystrokes their own session permanently. This makes
the above senarios much simpler, and doesn't affect the PSTN-PSTN
transport problem, other than you need two SDP sessions (tones and
audio)for that particular requirement. Simply modify RFC 2833 to require
two sessions - one for keystrokes and signaling, and one for voice
audio. Now you can treat them as the separate entities they really are,
and not a hybrid construct that is specific to the PSTN. I haven't heard
any reasons why this isn't a better solution.

As I have tried to point out in my previous posts, not every application
vendor will want to use voice recognition on every application. there
are many applications where speech recognition is not appropriate, and
could even be detrimental. There are many applications that send
keystrokes in one direction and voice in the other (IVR), and these
types of applications are becoming MORE popular, not less. Most
important, virtually all of the applications my company is implementing
need keystrokes from a caller to go one place, and audio from a caller
to go to another (or many other places).

http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/001933.html

Actually, that is my key point. in order to enable applications like the
one described above, the split between keystrokes and tones NEEDS TO BE
IN THE BASE RFC 2833 DOCUMENT. Otherwise you need splitters, or other
nefarious devices to implement most applications. We don't need
splitters for sending audio two places. Why would we require a splitter
to send audio one place and keystrokes another? Just reinvite a separate
keystroke session.

I agree, at least about the issue of DTMF and user input being similar
(assuming you mean keystrokes). I don't agree about the keys
dissapearing over time (See my post about addressing)

http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/002083.html

So perhaps DTMF and user keystroke input can be considered similar
enough that we could use a single protocol to transport both types of
things. Fair enough. We can default things like level or frequency or
time stamps when the transmitting device is a packet terminal that
doesn't care about those things. As long as keystrokes are in a separate
session from the audio, I can deal with these issues.

So that brings us to my second issue. Even if keystrokes have their own
session, they still need to be delivered by a reliable protocol. Henning
seems to feel that RTP with reliability extensions (RFC 2198) will fill
this bill.

Henning Schulzrinne said:
>RTP with redundancy is at least as reliable as SIP transport
http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/002087.html

RFC 2198 seems to be targeted specifically to reliably delivering audio
by transmitting redundant audio data. I was unable to find any mention
of how single-datum  events such as a non-audio keystroke from a SIP
terminal could be made reliable using RFC 2198. (I can think of some
ways, but none of them are specified in the document). I expect that, if
we are to use RFC 2198, we will have to extend it to deal with non-audio
keystrokes. I'm not saying it can't be done, just that we haven't said
how to do it yet. By the way, Colin Perkins, a participant in this
thread, was an author of the 2198 RFC for audio redundancy. Colin, if I
am putting words in your mouth, speak up.

There are several existing mechanisms for reliable delivery of
single-datum events. TCP, SCTP, and telnet come to mind. Would it be
easier to just select an existing reliable protocol for keystroke
transport, or develop RFC 2198 to the point it could be used for
single-datum non-audio events like a keystroke. Admittedly, it would be
nice to not require another protocol stack in devices that already
implement RTP, but what about things that aren't phones? Should we
require that any SIP device with keys support reliable RTP? Even if it
doesn't have a microphone or speaker? Is reliable RTP simpler or more
complex than the other reliable delivery mechanisms?

Why should we bias a protocol such as RFC 2833 towards devices with a
microphone and a keyboard? Why not bias it towards devices with video
camera and a keboard? Why not devices with just a keyboard?

Henning Schulzrinne said:
>every Ethernet phone will need to support RFC 2833 (and it's pretty

http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/001933.html

I'm not convinced that reliable RFC2833 is all that trivial for
non-audio keystrokes, since that hasn't been defined yet. I'm also not
convinced that reliable RFC2833 is vastly simpler or more complex that
other reliable protocols. I agree that a single protocol is nice, and if
reliable RTP isn't vastly more complex than a different reliable
protocol, we could use it.

I DEFINITELY agree with Henning that all SIP terminals should be
required to have the capability to send multiple copies of audio
streams. This should be in the base SIP (or is it SDP) specification.
This functionality is a MUST for a large set applications (virtually
every application my company builds). Multi-party calls, operator
intercept, voice logging, all of these applications would be much more
difficult and costly to implement, if session replication capability is
not present in EVERY SIP terminal (and gateway). All SIP terminals
should also be required to support requests for multiple copies of a
video session. They should all be required to support requests for
multiple copies of a keystroke session. We should consider this as one
of the highest priorities for updates to the basic SIP doc. What is the
process for getting this requirement into the base document?

Don't know what this has to do with splitting keystroke sesions from
audio, though.

Actually, I don't find this requirement for all devices (including
audio-less devices) to use reliable RTP particularly objectionable. As
long as reliable RTP delivery of keystrokes can be shown to be close to
as efficient in bandwidth and processing power as any of the other
transport protocol candidates, a reliable version of RFC 2833 would be a
viable approach to use. As long as the keystrokes have their own
session, and reliable RTP isn't too much of a hog compaired to the other
choices, let's use it. Of course we still need to define it (reliable
RTP for non-audio, single-datum events) first.

Comments?

Does SIP have an assigned TCP/UDP port number? If it doesn't is there a
reason why not? I am particularly concerned with the ability of SIP to be
used between domains where border elements may wish to have protocol
filtering that may be simplest with suppression of certain ports.

Hi Skip,

I think you have made some very important points regarding some of the
hurdles the "forked (keystrokes) streams" approach must overcome before it
can be implemented/adopted in a widespread manner. 

I agree that actual transport mechanism (Reliable/redundant RTP or RTP over
TCP or other) is a secondary concern as long as the simplicity, bandwidth
and processing power is comparable.
I also agree that a large change conceptual change needs to be made so that
keystrokes are treated as a _separate_ stream (like video or data) rather
than just an audio-vocoder optimization/extension conveying the same
information.

The largest hurdle IMO is broaching the whole problem of how to referr to a
particular stream in an SDP session and requesting that it be forked? (and
later that a particular copy can be terminated).

What limit do you set on the number of times the stream can be forked? This
number will definitely need to be greater than two streams if there multiple
application servers in the signalling path, 3, 4, 5, where do you stop ?
[This would be a very powerful DoS tool if abused, eg, tell an unsecured
client to send a 100 streams of audio to the target server.] 

How do you determine if a UA supports stream forking? 

IMHO, as Skip says,  these are really issues that need to be solved by SIP
(or atleast by SIP's use of SDP) and needs to become a core requirement of
UA's to make the system useful in a widespread manner.

RTP splitters (located in the network) for the keystroke stream were
proposed as an alternative to the forking of streams, however this approach
could easily cause unacceptable arrival delays between the audio & keystroke
RTP packets at the remote UA (or the complete loss of one stream). 

Regards,

Robert.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
	Author(s)	: M. Handley, H. Schulzrinne, 
                          E. Schooler, J. Rosenberg

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

-----------------------------------------------------------

IPTS 2000 is a new workshop dedicated to the important, emerging field of IP
Telecom Services research.

In contrast to the services available on the PSTN, a new world of telecom
services is possible on an IP-based infrastructure. This world presents new
challenges for service development, deployment and management. This one-day
workshop will serve as a forum for the dissemination of research relating to
these challenges.

We have put together an excellent technical program that includes 7 original
research papers, two invited speakers, and a round table discussion. We look
forward to the participation from you and your colleagues in the telecom
industry and the research community. Registration is now open at

I think its value is an implementation decision. There are only two
cases where the 487 won't be received almost immediately:

1. the UAS doesn't send it, and it won't send anything since it got the
CANCEL
2. the UAS sent a different final response already, which passed the
CANCEL on the wire

So, either a final response (487 or otherwise) will come nearly right
away, or nothing at all. It won't come right away because of possible
network packet loss. So, its reasonable to assume something anywhere
between 10 and 32 seconds, which represents a window of reasonable
packet loss.

We should clarify this in the spec, as this timer is needed for
backwards compatibility, as you indicate.



 Upon expiration of

No. What good would that server?

 If it resent the INVITE to a

Upon expiration, it would generate its own 487 or 408 response to the
INVITE.

All. Standard forking behavior.

Its a side effect of catastrophically bad network conditions. I expect
some conditions would be non-existent in networks used to provide
residential phone service over IP.

The -01 draft also mentions that the Request URIs must be identical, to
support spirals.

As an additional thing, the *top* Vias must be the same, in order to
detect merged requests. We should add this here and elsewhere in the
document as needed.

You later write:

Yes. Two FRoms are equal if (1) their URIs match under URI comparison,
(2) their From parameters match, based on standard matching rules for
header parameters (case sensitive equality of both name and value). 

It might be a good idea to formally define "identical" in this section.
Its a constant source of confusion and problems at the bakeoffs.

I suggest you read RFC 2793 which describes how to use RFC 2198 redundancy
as a `reliable' transport for non-audio keystrokes.

Hi,

The "reliability of provisional responses" draft mandates that the 
To header in PRACK mirror the "tag", if the provisional response
contained one. Also the PRACK must take the path specified by the
Route header, if the provisional response contained Record-route
headers.

If the UAC needs to send a CANCEL after it has received a 
non-100 reliable provisional response with a to-tag and record-route,

Does the CANCEL still mirror the INVITE being cancelled ?

Or,
Based on the provisional response,
1. Does the CANCEL mirror the "tag" in To header ?
2. Does the CANCEL take the path specified by the Route header ?

Your help in clarifying this issue is appreciated.

Thanks
-- Sudipto

PLEASE, folks. Use the main sip list for sip technical questions, NOT
the sipforum list.

The SIP supported header allows clients to express extesnions they
support, so the server can know if it is OK to place additional new
headers in the response.

hi all,
    A strong doubt has cropped in my mind relating to multicast 
conferencing, since most corporate disable udp packets fully, Is there 
anyone who is making use of the SIP stack to do conferencing on the internet 
presently or they are all using it for their LANs and waiting for RTP over 
TCP and multicasting also over tcp. Please give me the details.
       Thanking you all,
                 rahul

I haven't heard of any corporations "disabling udp packets fully" unless you
mean disabling general UDP access from the outside through a corporate or other
Firewall. I do know that several ISPs support internal multicast backbones
using varied pricing schemes, though I'm not aware of any that support
inter-ISP multicast. That's usually addressed either by NSP's to different
degrees or build-your-own backbone, neither of which is cheap.

Hello;

A little secret is that many corporate firewalls that "block UDP traffic" keep open a range of ports for
UDP traffic from RealNetworks. They do this because of complaints from their
users if they can't get Real. If SIP also blocks out a range of ports, and has a good security record,
and is in frequent use, this will probably not be much of a problem.

                                 Regards
                                 Marshall Eubanks

a) CPL, 
b) WML, 
c) VoiceXML and 
d) the call processing features and user preferences
defined for SIP?

It would be nice if the inter-relationships between
these protocols (CPL, WML, VoiceXML and SIP features)
and the call processing problem could be captured in
an informational RFC to eliminate duplicated effort
and to identify areas in which no protocol has been
set up. An expecially important set of topics would be
areas in which it would be undesirable for a protocol
to be created.

There was a suggestion here previously that CPL be
extended to encompass switches on authorization. This
is coming perilously near the use of CPL to handle
classes of service. This would be one step on an
infinite journey of defining a call processing
architecture which could not be finished. it would be
like painting the Golden Gate Bridge. When it is done,
it is time to start over.

I just want to clarify that you are not suggesting that we go solely with 
the "TCP-AVP" nomenclature, yes?  Rather, you're suggesting that we have 
"TCP" (or some such that suggests raw TCP with no AVP) *and* a 
"RTP/AVP-TCP" which implies RTP/AVP using TCP rather than UDP.

Have I got that right?

The XTML spec includes a brief comparison with CPL and VoiceXML
(Although this does not thoroughly answer the question.)

Presumably parameters missing in one of the From/To are ignored in the
comparison. This seems to work for 'tag'.

Note that according to RFC 2616 and the BNF definition, 

"literal"
      Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise,
      the text is case-*in*sensitive.

Added to URI section (not sure what you mean by "this section").

Deleted, since it doesn't belong in URLs.

There are other items from that RFC, so just reference added.

No, since H now references RFC 2616, the current HTTP/1.1 spec.

Several choices:

- Create a new session (by adding a new m= line) for keyboard only. Use
the c= line to direct it to Term2. Leave the c= lines for video alone.
Use a different c= line to point audio to Term3.

- Have the terminal that also wants audio or keystrokes to INVITE itself
as another call leg to the session.

Has to do with ease of synchronization at the tone reconstruction point.

You want to allow both:

- embedded in audio stream for recreating audio + tones with tight
synchronization;

- just events, for entities that don't care about audio.

The above mechanism supports this.

In practice, the worst thing that can happen to you is that you get some
spurious audio packets. Drop them on the floor and don't forget to empty
the bit bucket at the end of the day.

It may also be a good idea to have devices implement text transport as a
payload type, even if the keyboard is limited to 12 keys. (You'd
probably want a mode to use alpha input mode with
press-2-twice-to-get-B.)

Currently, the end of keystrokes (last packet) is retransmitted a
setable number of times, according to RFC 2833.

RTP can already use TCP, but not all devices will support TCP (or the
even more complex SCTP).

The IETF doesn't really do device requirements. TIA would be the more
appropriate body for this. (SIP is not just for audio devices or devices
with keyboards, so I don't think this is appropriate for an IETF
standard. There are all kinds of SIP UAs that wouldn't need this
capability.)

All,

As discussed in Pittsburgh, we are ready for the final review of the
Call Flows I-D (draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-01.txt).  I'm looking for
volunteers who will take a couple of sections from the document and go
over the examples in detail. I'll give you a list of section numbers and
what to check for - all the usual suspects such as missing headers, CSeq
and Call-ID inconsistencies, missing tags, etc.   I already have a few
who have sent me mail, but we need more. Also, I could use some who know
ISUP or ISDN to check some of the Gateway scenarios.

Send me a mail if you can help - I'll have the version for final review
ready by next week.

Thanks,
Alan Johnston

Hello all,

  Good afternoon.

  I was wondering if there's anybody aware of encoding algorithm out
  there which can be used to encode encrypted host (concealed) so that
it
  fits the 'token' syntax (any open source code??).

  Also, while handling such hidden hosts should the proxy parser
behaviour
  be lineant to accomodate any characters if it doesn't comply to that
  required set?

  Thanks for your suggestions. Have a good day!!

Regards,

Nilesh.

Yes, that was my suggestion. Just as there is a "udp" and "RTP/AVP" profile
we should create a "tcp" and "RTP/AVP-TCP" SDP profile. People seem to be
suggesting uses for both definitions.

The motivation for the CPL authentication extension is call 
processing logic may depend on authentication status. 
Consider, for example, a SIP-2-PSTN gateway. Operator of 
the gateway may want to provide 800 and local calls for free 
to anyone whereas LD calls only to authenticated users.
Using CPL scripts to specify which calls will be accepted
and which not seems the most natural way to me. 

Note that the CPL extension does not require creating 
a new protocol.

If you still see some complexity of "painting the Golden
Bridge" grade, please be more specific. (And please use the
iptel mailing list rather than sip.)

What I see is an endless set of features being added
to protocols which were not designed to handle them.
What was described below of different services to
different classes of users is a type of class of
service. Like most call processing, any one portion of
it is very simple to describe and probably very simple
to implement. Like most call processing, it is only
one small part of a total group of services that are
very difficult to describe and very difficult to
implement. 

What I am really asking for is a discussion that will
delimit the boundaries of what all of these protocols
will do so that we will not have an endless succession
of small features being added to these protocols. By
the time, the exercise of defining all of these small
features would be done, the market would have changed
and an entirely new set of features would be required.
Hence my analogy of painting the Golden Gate Bridge.

Yes. That behavior is unchanged.

The To field in the CANCEL is the same as the INVITE.

No. CANCEL never contains routes.

I agree as well. I am particularly interested in RTP/AVP-TCP for the
purposes of firewall traversal.

I want to be sure we are consistent about what the semantic is of values
we place inside of SDP. So, lets take a step back. For passive, both and
uni, we need to specify the port we are listening on. This port will
also be the source port of packets sent back to the host which initiated
the connection. For active connections, David wishes to indicate the
source port that will be used in the initial SYN packet. I'm still not
clear on why this is needed.

In any case, these are two different pieces of information, and as such,
should be conveyed in separate places. The m line is idea for the listen
port. In the case of active connections, I would propose this ALWAYS be
9. In this case, should a foolish firewall open up a hole to port 9, its
not a big deal. If active is in use, the a line could contain the source
port that will be used:

a=direction:active 9384

Good point on NAT. I have no problem combining both uni and both, and
allowing apps to decide how they distribute it. We would need to say
that implementations need to be prepared to receive packets on either
connection.

Sounds like we are nearing consensus. If thats the case, someone should
write up the 3 page I-D on the subject and we can move forward.

Hi,

The following internet drafts have been submitted and are now available on
the IETF site:

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-odoherty-sip-servlet-delivery-0
0.txt

Overview:
   This document  proposes a way to distribute SIP Servlets to SIP 
   clients using the SIP protocol itself, including a way to 
   authenticate the source of the Servlet. This may prove a useful 
   mechanism for rolling out new services across multiple SIP 
   clients. 
    
   In addition it proposes a way for an originating SIP Client to 
   specify in a message generated by it that it wants the message to 
   be passed to a particular named SIP Servlet in the receiving SIP 
   Client. 

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-odoherty-root-sip-servlet-00.tx
t

Overview:
  This Internet draft builds on and refines the SIP Servlet API. 
   The SIP Servlet API defines an API for SIP Clients 
   that allows them, via a SIP Servlet engine, present messages to 
   'Servlets' which can then interact with the message and the Client 
   to change the behaviour of the SIP Client. 
    
   This document expands on this concept to: 
    
   - Suggest a standard way to identity or name SIP Servlets 
    
   - Introduce the concept of a 'Root' SIP Servlet 
    
   - Introduce some rules and mechanisms for SIP Servlet interaction 
    
   - Suggest some Permission parameters for invoked SIP Servlets 

If anybody has any comments it is probably best to use the SIP Servlet API
receiver list at :

"Record-Route is only relevant for 2xx responses and responses where the
server can expect the client to retry for the same call-id, as in
401(Unauthorized) or 484 (Address Incomplete)"  in section 6.33.1

Does allowing provisional reliable responses to contain 
Record-Route introduce a slight problem with the wording of 
6.34.2 of the bis? This says that if a UAC finds a Record-Route 
header in any response, it copies it into the Route header of all
subsequent requests within the same call leg. Doesn't that mean
that a Record-Route of provisional response could find it's way
into a CANCEL or is this already explicitly forbidden somewhere 
else?

Maybe the wording of 6.34.2 needs to be:

If a UAC finds a Record-Route header in a final response, it 
copies it into ...                        ^^^^^  

Also as a CANCEL never contains routes there is no reason 
for the Route header to be marked as optional for CANCEL 
in Table 5.

Cheers,
Neil.

Also a good idea.

This is not the case. They are also relevant for reliable provisional
responses, as
specified in:

Well, just wanted to add that using base64 may not entirely fit in the
token syntax due to the characters '/' and '=' generated by base64
and are not a part of token.

Any comments are highly appreciated. Have a good day!!

Nilesh.

In draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-03.txt, there is a subset of ISUP base protocol
parameters listed. However, there is no similar  table describing the ISUP
version parameters. Considering that the version parameter is mandatory, it
may be a good idea to include a list/table of valid values. (I believe that
uk21 is the only ISUP version listed.)  I don't think that this is something
that we would want implementors to go off and decide on their own. Any
comments?

For the support of unknown methods, do these methods have to
be supported for active calls or for callIds for which there is no call
as well?

I believe the current thinking is that IANA registration will be used for
ISUP versions that are associated with a published standard, though a few
possible versions will be provided by way of example. The authors are
concerned that there are potentially too many obscure national variants to
catalogue them within the MIME draft itself.

draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime -03.txt


In draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-03.txt, there is a subset of ISUP base protocol
parameters listed. However, there is no similar  table describing the ISUP
version parameters. Considering that the version parameter is mandatory, it
may be a good idea to include a list/table of valid values. (I believe that
uk21 is the only ISUP version listed.)  I don't think that this is something
that we would want implementors to go off and decide on their own. Any
comments?

Ok, if 180 is to be used for remote ringback (ie SDP in the 180 response)
then I believe that a reference needs to be made to this usage in
RFC2543bis; a clarification is also needed on the different handling of a
180 with or without SDP (for instance, if a 180 response is received with an
SDP body is it a SHOULD or a MAY that the specified audio stream should be
played?); and lastly, an example should be placed somewhere (either in
RFC2543 or otherwise definitely in the call flows draft). 

The 183 draft also needs also be explicitly clarified in this respect.[IMO]

Cheers,

Robert.

Hows that? The BNF is quite explicit that it is a single name-addr or
addr-spec:

A server can always reject a request with a 405 even if it does support
the method, and it can use any logic to determine when/if it should send
a 405.

Practically speaking, if a new method makes sense both inside and
outside of a call, and you implement it, I suspect your code would
support both cases.

Jonathan,

Perhaps Simon was referring to the following, which says that a
general-header can occur any number of times in a message.  I saw no
reference to the restriction that a `From' could only occur once in a
message (although it makes sense).

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

According to the grammar multiple to and from lines are allowed (just as
RFC822 allows multiple to and from addresses). The text often refers to
comparisons involving the To line (single).

Are multiple To/From lines allowed?

Is there any equivalent of Bcc:?

Ok, if 180 is to be used for remote ringback (ie SDP in the 180 response)
then I believe that a reference needs to be made to this usage in
RFC2543bis; a clarification is also needed on the different handling of a
180 with or without SDP (for instance, if a 180 response is received with an
SDP body is it a SHOULD or a MAY that the specified audio stream should be
played?); and lastly, an example should be placed somewhere (either in
RFC2543 or otherwise definitely in the call flows draft).

The 183 draft also needs also be explicitly clarified in this respect.[IMO]

Cheers,

Robert.

Hi all,

Is there any standard method or has anyone thought about a way to register a
range of telephone-subscribers?

A SIP-PSTN gateway is not always aware of the exact presence of all its PSTN
endpoints. It may merely know that the trunk connecting to a range of phone
numbers is active. For instance, 555-4000 to 555-4999. It is impractical to
register 1000 endpoints individually but there still seems to be good cause
to want to register all these possible addresses with a SIP proxy.

The most straight forward solution would seem to be to devise a method for
SIP-PSTN gateways to register using a tel: URL [RFC2806] in the To header
that specified a wildcard/pattern-match telephone-subscriber (currently not
supported). Suggestions? Adding a wildcard digit and/or new parameters.

eg. sip:555-4xxx;matchrange=0-79@gateway;user=tel-pattern 
	to specify 555-4000 to 555-4079 (just as a trivial example). The
user=tel-pattern ensures that the tel: is not processed as standard
telephone-subscriber.

Any other ideas or comments ?

This problem has probably been solved in H.323 Gatekeeper registrations but
I am not very au fait with the mechanisms of that protocol. Perhaps someone
else can comment.

Regards,

Robert.

Hi,

You might want to take a look at:

it should answer your question

Thanks

Actually, the draft does state that multiple headers are not always allowed:

"Multiple header fields with the same field-name may be present in a message
if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a
comma-separated list (i.e., #(values))." (par. 6.5, "Header field format")

Thats's the case for the Via: header, which can therefore appear multiple
times (or equivalently can contain several via values). That's not the case
for the From: field, so it cannot appear several times. At least that's how
I read it.

Best regards,

Laurent,

I figured it must be somewhere, I just missed it...

Thanks for the pointer.

Hi,

    Assuming we can use wildcard cahracter  to register a
    set of user,  what would be the response when not all users
    were successfuly registered ?

Thanks

Just a thought but is there a real need for the restriction 
that all active registrations MUST share the same Action?
I would expect a Proxy co-located with a Registrar to want to
proxy to registrations however in the case of non SIP URIs 
this may not be possible. But you don't want it to become a 
redirect server just to handle a single mailto:, or whatever,
registered amongst a bunch of SIP URLs. 

So why not allow a Proxy/Registrar to accept a mixture of actions 
in registrations if it wants to. A SIP server could proxy to 
those contacts registered with a proxy action and then if it 
gets no 2xx response it could return a 3xx, perhaps making use of
the new Contacts-Tried header, along with any contacts 
registered with a redirect action (incl non SIP URIs).
Of course if a server doesn't accept a mix of actions it can 
still respond 409 Conflict.

Cheers,
Neil.

Umm, no. Bad assumption. There is no such thing.

There is no point in worrying about error conditions for imaginary
protocol features.

Would both "TCP" and "RTP/AVP-TCP" share the same a= line options?  Would 
they therefore be described in the same I-D or is there sufficiently more 
to say about RTP/AVP-TCP to warrant its own I-D?

I talked about this earlier in the thread (substitute "port zero" in the 
mail for "PORT_ANY" or however you want to think about it):

http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/001855.html

I don't know what to add to the above email---I thought I spelled it out 
fairly explicitly.

Urk, it's amazing how hard it is to wedge this functionality into SDP 
without having at least *one* distasteful workaround. :-)

The only thing I would add is that the direction:both should also be 
allowed to specify a source port if the UA deemed it necessary.

So that leaves us with:

direction:active
direction:passive
direction:both

Unless somebody else is already typing madly away on the I-D, I'd be happy 
to write it up since I'm the one to blame for this thread. :-)

I just wanted to clarify that by "a= line options" I meant the new 
"direction" attribute.  Obviously RTP/AVP-TCP has a slew of other a= 
options that are not necessarily applicable to just TCP.

Henning seems to be saying that, by putting DTMF keystrokes in the same session with audio, is is in some sense "easier" for the receiver to synchronize the key entry with the compressed audio stream. Also he seems to imply that you can synchronize the two media types more "tightly" if they are in the same stream.

Of course, there are lots of applications that must synchronize multiple media streams. A video and audio application comes to mind. Or video and keystrokes. If what Henning says is true, then all media that needs to be tightly synchronized (audio, video, keystrokes, force-feedback controls, etc.....) should be placed in a single RTP session. 

Henning, are you saying that if you need to tightly synchronize video and audio, both media types should be placed in the same session? Or video & keystrokes? Doesn't SIP allow synchronization between two separate sessions just as easily as if they were in the same session? Surely, if you use the same timestamps for a DTMF stream and an audio stream, you can exactly re-synchronize them at the receiver end, regardless if they are in the same session or not?

RFC 1890, Henning's last word on Video & Audio streaming, specifically states:
"The payload types currently defined in this profile carry either audio or video, but not both". Therefore, audio & video are defined as separate media types with separate sessions. You should still should be able to synchronize audio & video even if they are in separate sessions.

For another option, Colin Perkins writes:

http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2000q3/002113.html

RFC 2793 - "RTP Payload for Text Conversation" is an RFC which I had somehow overlooked (thank you, Colin) which proposes a method to use RTP to transport T.140 "text conversation" sessions. It includes the assumption that the T.140 session will be a separate session from other media (good). However, it doesn't provide a way to indicate keystroke duration (bad). RFC 2793 proposes the same optional redundancy mechanism (RFC 2198) as Henning promotes to provide "reliable" transport in RCF 2833. 

RFC 2793 does not implement a traditional acknowledge-each-transmission kind of reliability. Instead, it uses RFC 2198 (like 2833) which proposes sending each datum more than once, thus raising the tolerance somewhat to lost packets. I doesn't eliminate errors due to lost packets, it just lowers the probability of occurance. I'm not sure if this is the best reliability mechanism for keystroke transport, but it is certainly better than doing nothing. Reliabile transport should not be an option for keystrokes, it should be a requirement.

An important point here is that we have at least two different ways to exchange keystroke data between two SIP devices RFC 2833 (DTMF part) and RFC 2793. They each use different mechanisms to send the keystrokes, with different encodings. 

The two keystroke transport mechanisms even use different key encodings. RFC 2833 uses the following encoding for keys:

Event  encoding (decimal)
_________________________
0--9                0--9
*                     10
#                     11
A--D              12--15

RFC 2833 doesn't define encodings for any other keys. It assumes that all devices will only have a maximum of 16 keys. RFC also lumps lots of other non-keystroke-related stuff into the same category as keystrokes - call progress tones, hook flash, fax tones, etc.

RFC 2793 proposes ISO/IEC 10646-1, level 3 (Unicode) encoding to define a much larger set of keys, but the 16 keys defined in RFC 2833 keys are included. 

0x0030         DIGIT ZERO
0x0031         DIGIT ONE
0x0032         DIGIT TWO
0x0033         DIGIT THREE
0x0034         DIGIT FOUR
0x0035         DIGIT FIVE
0x0036         DIGIT SIX
0x0037         DIGIT SEVEN
0x0038         DIGIT EIGHT
0x0039         DIGIT NINE
0x0041         LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
0x0042         LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B
0x0043         LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C
0x0044         LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D
0x002A         ASTERISK
0x0023         NUMBER SIGN

As you can see, the two protocols have two vastly different ways to encode the same thing - keystrokes.

If I can summarize:
RFC 2833 was designed to solve a very narrow problem set - the transport of all mechanically-generated PSTN tones and other PSTN events across a packet network, when the PSTN audio has been compressed by a non-tone-friendly compression scheme. RFC 2833 defines a large set of other events besides DTMF in the event transport - call progress signaling, flash, fax tones, etc, to aid in the transport of PSTN functionality across a packet network.

Henning has shown how this mechanism can be extended to cover other application requirements (i.e. keystroke transport) using SDP media control mechanisms (m=), albeit it is not a perfect fit. 

RFC 2793 was designed to solve a different problem set - the transport of durationless keystrokes. This RFC uses ISO/IEC 10646-1, level 3 to define a much larger set of keys, but the keys on a DTMF phone are also included in the set.

Both RFCs propose an optional usage of RFC 2198 for psuedo-reliable transport. I am not convinced that this mechanism is preferrable to more traditional reliable protocols, but it may be adequate. However, for keystrokes a reliability mechanism should be required, not optional.

So why do we have two ways to transport keystrokes? 

In my company's applications we plan to receive SIP INVITES from PSTN/SIP Gateways, Softswitches, SIP phones, SIP mobile devices, and all manner of SIP terminals. We will INVITE sessions with all of these same types of devices. 

ALL of the key input from these different sources should use the same protocol. The key input that we send to all of these devices should use the same protocol. We don't want to have to use different protocols to send keystrokes to a SIP gateway, a SIP wireless device, a Softswitch, or a PC. We don't want to have to know ahead of time what type of device we are calling to determine what kind of session to INVITE to get keystrokes. All keystrokes, whether it be DTMF or 101-key PC keyboard should use the same protocol. 

It should be fairly easily to combine the PSTN-specific characteristics of RFC 2833 (duration, level, etc), with the separate session and large defined keyset of RFC 2793. By making level and frequency parameters optional, we can deal with both kinds of transmission devices. We should consider whether the redundancy reliability mechanism (RFC 2198) provides adequate reliability for keystroke transport.

If PSTN transport vendors want to stick fax tones and call progress in with the compressed audio in a gateway-to-gateway RTP session, that's fine. just don't put keystrokes in there. The're a different animal.

Not necessarily. I think 'tag' is a special case. In a UAC when checking if
a 200 response matches an existing call leg you need to be able to compare
its To: header which has a tag to the To: header of the original INVITE,
which usually doesn't have a tag, and get the result that the two are the
same.  I think that this is the reason for the To/From comparison rules that
disregard a missing tag.  With other (generic-param) parameters this may not
be the case.  For example:
	From: sip:itamarg@tlv.radvision.com;extparam=1
and 
	From: sip:itamarg@tlv.radvision.com

may not necessarily be the same.

Is there any recommendation on how to keep a timed connection "alive" 
between a SIP client that is behind a firewall and a SIP server that is 
outside the firewall?

What do you mean by a timed connection between SIP clients and servers?

I see two separate packet flow classes:

a) Signaling

  Typically, there is a static permission in firewall that 
allows UDP traffic from/to a SIP proxy at port 5060 to pass
through. 
  Keeping a session alive is a SIP issue, which works the same
way regardless if firewalls are deployed or not.

b) Media

Either the firewall implements an embedded SIP ALG and 
opens media pinholes dynamically or a SIP proxy instructs
the firewall to do so.

There is a document on firewall traversal:

Hi,

Short form: In the presence of Early Media, prior to receiving 200 OK, how 
can a Caller tell a Callee to send media according to a *new* SDP ? Or "How 
can I put a call on hold when I hear a remotely generated ringback tone ?"

Much longer form:

It is generaly agreed that making Media and Signaling distinct is a good 
thing. Amoung other benefit it enables decomposed architectures and more 
generaly support the locality of concern principle.

A prime example of this distinction is SDP usage in SIP. SIP is basically 
concerned by Signaling whereas SDP is about Media.

Signaling is mainly about setting up and tearing down communications. Media 
is mainly about payload formats and destinations.

It is my understanding that, prior to 183 Session Progress, Media data 
started to flow only after INVITE's 200 OK final response was received or 
acknowledged (depending on side).

Afterward, changes impacting Media (changes in SDPs) occured at any time 
using re-INVITE. Callee could ask Caller "Please now handle Media according 
to this new SDP". Caller could do the same. This was fine.

However, since 183 Provisionnal response was introduced, as well as other 
new occasions to change SDPs during call setup, Media can start to flow 
well before 200 OK, or even in the total absence of 200 OK.

This may introduce an issue regarding control of Media, during the setup phase:
	Callee can still ask Caller "Please now handle Media according to this 
*new* SDP", simply sending a new 183. However I fear that Caller *cannot* 
ask Callee to change Media any more.

To be fully accurate, it seems that Caller could still ask Callee to change 
Media, if SDP is allowed in PRACK, but only in response to Callee doing it 
first. Is SDP legal in PRACK's ack message ?

So my question is: "In the presence of Early Media, how can a Caller ask a 
Callee to handle Media according to a new SDP when Caller's INVITE 
transaction is still not completed ?".

One potential solution could be to allow re-INVITE while the "main" INVITE 
is still not completed. It is illegal today. This would introduce 
"nested-transaction", but I guess that (PR w/SDP + PRACK) is already a form 
of nested transaction, isn't it ?

Another solution, probably simplier, would be to enable 183 "both ways": 
The Caller would have the rigth to send it to the Callee, potentially only 
in the presence of Early Media. But that seems weird, because it is a 
reponse without a question.

If you are guessing "why the hell does this matter ?", please think of 
potential restrictions if Media cannot change while call is beeing setted up.

One example related to mobility (probably not 100% relevant, not a thread 
to SIP for Mobility):
Lets say I have a decomposed cheap wireless IP phone:
	- The expensive UA has a fixed IP address and a full featured SIP stack 
with a fancy Java user application, it handles multiple phones.
	- The cheap phones have no fixed IP addresses, a very ligth 
Codec+RTP+UDP+IP stack and some minimal stimulus protocol to interact with 
the UA.
Whenever the phone's IP address changes, the UA will change the Media of 
the involved SIP calls, if any.

Now the issue: What if the phone moves while receiving Early Media (say 
remote ringback tone) ? UA need to tell the Callee about the Calling 
phone's new IP address. How ?

Other, simplier, issues: How do I put a call on hold when I am listening to 
some network generated annoucement ? How can an assistant, dialing on 
behalf of the boss, transfer the ringing call to the boss when ringback 
tone is generated remotely ?

Any previous art in solving this issue (if it is actually an issue) ?
Is there a similar issue in H.323 (Early H.245 related I guess) or was it 
solved ?

BTW: A *radical* solution would be to avoid 1xx responses that initiate 
Early Media and have a 200 OK as soon as media is there (with probably some 
hints that the call/session is not "fully" established). Some yet to define 
"INFO Session Progress" could later on indicate how the call is 
progressing. This has the merit of beeing compatible with existing 
implementations.

Would appreciate if people on the iptel and SIP discussion lists can voice
their opinions (agree or disagree) on draft-yu-tel-url-00.txt (see
attachment).  This enhancement to the tel URL is intended to allow SIP to
carry number portability related information in the Request-URI field.  The
information (e.g., routing number and POTS number) in the tel URL may be
used by the LSs for call routing.  Thanks.

 Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support NP          July 2000


 1. Abstract

   Number portability (NP) allows the telephone subscribers to keep
   their telephone numbers when they change service provider, move to a
   new location, or change the subscribed services.  The NP
   implementations in many countries presently support service provider
   portability for geographic numbers and non-geographical numbers.  It
   has been identified that NP has impacts on several works-in-progress
   at the IETF.  One of the impacts is to carry the NP related
   information in the SIP INVITE message.  This document proposed the
   extensions to the "tel" and "fax" Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
   to support NP so that they can be used to carry the NP related
   information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Request-URI.


2. Introduction

   This document proposes the extensions to the "tel" and "fax" Uniform
   Resource Locators (URLs) for supporting number portability (NP).
   [NP] provides an overview of the NP in the GSTN and points out the
   impacts of NP in several works-in-progress at the IETF Working
   Groups.  One of the impacts is to be able to carry the NP related
   information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVITE message.

   The NP related information includes the dialed directory number, a
   routing number and an indicator that indicates whether a query to
   the Number Portability Database (NPDB) has been performed.  The
   routing number allows the network, either the Global Switched
   Telephone Network (GSTN) or the IP-based network, to route the call
   to the network or switch that currently serves the dialed called
   party number that has ported out of the donor network. The NPDB dip
   indicator informs the network entities downstream towards the
   terminating network (e.g., the network that currently serves the
   called party number) that NPDB dip has been performed; therefore,
   there is no need to dip the NPDB again.  The dialed called party
   number is needed at the terminating switch so that the call can be
   terminated to a correct line card.  If the routing number only
   points to the terminating network, the called party number would be
   used for another NPDB query to retrieve another routing number that
   is typically a network-specific routing number for routing the call
   to the terminating switch.


3. SIP Request-URI

   The SIP INVITE message contains a "Request-URI" element that is used
   by the SIP servers for making routing decisions.  As indicated in
   [SIP], SIP servers may support Request-URIs with schemes other than
   "SIP," for example, the "tel" URI scheme. [TEL] specifies the URL
   schemes "tel," "fax" and "modem" for specifying the location of a
   terminal in the phone network and the connection types (modes of
   operation) that can be used to connect to that entity.  By examining
   the SIP URL and "tel" URL, it seems that the "tel" URL is a better

   place to carry the NP related information.  Since the "fax" URL may
   be used for fax calls, both the "tel" and "fax" URLs need to be
   enhanced to support NP.


4. Proposed extensions to the "tel" RUL Scheme

   The following shows the extensions to the "tel" URL.  Only the
   impacted items/lines are shown below.

   global-phone-number  =3D (no change)
                          (no change)
                          (no change)
                          *1(number-portability)
   local-phone-number   =3D (no change)
                          (no change)
                          (no change)
                          (no change)
                          future-extension) *1(number-portability)
   number-portability   =3D ";" routing-number *1(";" =
npdb-dip-indicator)
   routing-number       =3D rn-tag "=3D" *1("+") rn-ident
   rn-tag               =3D "rn"
   rn-ident             =3D *15(hex excluding "F")
   npdi-dip-indicator   =3D npdi-tag "=3D" npdi-ident
   npdi-tag             =3D "npdi"
   npdi-ident           =3D "yes" / "no"

   It is assumed that national routing number may appear with other
   global-phone-number information and international routing number may
   appear with other local-phone-number information.  The routing
   number digit can be any hexadecimal digit except the digit "F."

   The routing number and the NPDB dip indicator can appear at most
   once if present.  The routing number can contain hexadecimal digits
   from 0 to E. When the routing number is present, the NPDB dip
   indicator may or may not be present.  This is because that the
   routing number may be present independent of NP.  When the "npdi"
   parameter is not present, it indicates that either NPDB dip has not
   been performed (equivalent to npdi=3Dno) or NP is not relevant.  If =
a
   SIP server is set to perform the NPDB queries and if a received
   INVITE message does not contain "yes" in the "npdi" parameter, it
   will perform the NPDB query.  The NPDB query is outside the scope of
   this document.  The routing number received in the response (plus
   the "+" and the country code when necessary) will replace the
   routing number in the "rn" parameter if present or will be used by
   the new "rn" parameter if "rn" parameter is not present.  The "npdi"
   parameter will be set to "yes" in this case.  The routing number can
   be a global routing number (e.g., with "+" and the country code) or
   a local (e.g., network-specific) routing number.   When the "rn"
   parameter is present, it must be used for making routing decisions
   (e.g., against the TRIP routing tables)[TRIP].  If the "rn"
   parameter is not present, the telephone number right after "tel:" is
   used as the routing number.

   It is possible that interworking between SIP and Signaling System
   No. 7 (SS7) Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP) is
   required at the border between the Global Switched Telephone Network
   (GSTN) and the IP-based network.  For SIP to GSTN interworking and
   depending on the ISUP support of NP, the information in the "tel"
   URL will be mapped/carried in the proper ISUP parameters.  For
   example, for the GSTN in the U.S., the routing number in the "rn"
   parameter is carried in the ISUP Called Party Number Parameter.  The
   phone number after "tel:" is carried in the ISUP Generic Address
   Parameter.  Only national numbers are carried (e.g., without the "+"
   and the country code) in the ISUP parameter.  The "npdi" parameter
   that contains "yes" cause the Forward Call Indicator parameter to be
   properly set to indicate that NPDB has been dipped.   If the
   terminating GSTN supports concatenated routing number and directory
   number (e.g., in Europe), then the routing number and the phone
   number are concatenated and put in the ISUP Called Party Number
   parameter.  The NOA value will be set according the terminating
   GSTN's NP standards.

   For GSTN to IP interworking, when the ISUP signaling contains the NP
   related information, the NP related information is mapped to the
   "tel" URL.  This happens for domestic calls where the originating
   GSTN has performed the NPDB query, or for international calls that
   have arrived at the terminating country's GSTN where that GSTN has
   performed the NPDB query.  It is assumed that the GSTN routes the
   call via the IP-based network to the terminating switch or network
   in the same country, and SIP and ISUP interworking is involved.  For
   the GSTN in the U.S., the interworking is straightforward.  The
   indication in the ISUP Forward Call Indicator parameter that NPDB
   dip has been performed will set "npdi" to "yes," the number in the
   Called Party Number parameter plus the "+" and the country code, if
   a global routing number, is carried in the "rn" parameter, and
   called party number in the Generic Address Parameter plus the "+"
   and the country code, if a global phone number, appears after
   "tel:".  For GSTN that supports concatenated routing number and
   directory number (e.g., in Europe), the IP entity that performs the
   interworking needs to know the routing number used by the GSTN so
   that the routing number and the directory number in the concatenated
   format in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter can be separate out
   and transported in the "rn" parameter and after "tel:" by adding the
   "+" and the country code to them if they are global routing number
   and phone numbers.

5. Proposed extension to the "fax" URL Scheme

   The following shows the extensions to the "fax" URL.  Only the
   impacted items/lines are shown below.


   fax-global-phone     =3D (no change)
                          (no change)
                          (no change)

   number-portability   =3D ";" routing-number *1(";" =
npdb-dip-indicator)
   routing-number       =3D rn-tag "=3D" *1("+") rn-ident
   rn-tag               =3D "rn"
   rn-ident             =3D *15(hex excluding "F")
   npdi-dip-indicator   =3D npdi-tag "=3D" npdi-ident
   npdi-tag             =3D "npdi"
   npdi-ident           =3D "yes" / "no"

   The same discussions in Section 5 also apply to this section.


6. Examples

   To simply the example and to focus on the "tel" URL in the Request-
   URI, only the Request-Line of a complete SIP INVITE message is
   shown.  A SIP server receives an INVITE message as shown below where
   +1-202-533-1234 is the dialed called party number and has been
   ported out of the donor network.

   INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234 SIP/2.0

   Assume that this SIP server is set to perform the NPDB query.  Since
   this INVITE message does not contain the "npdi" parameter, this SIP
   server will perform a NPDB query.  After receiving a response back
   from a NPDB, it formulates the following SIP INVITE message:

   INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=3D+1-202-544-0000;npdi=3Dyes SIP/2.0

   This SIP server then uses the "rn" parameter to make the routing
   decisions (e.g., using the routing number in the "rn" parameter to
   check against the TRIP tables to determine the terminating GSTN
   gateway).

   If the dialed called party number +1-202-533-1234 is not ported and
   the dialed called party number can be used as the routing number,
   the outbound SIP INVITE message may look like

   INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=3D+1-202-533-1234;npdi=3Dyes SIP/2.0

   or

   INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;npdi=3Dyes SIP/2.0

   The concept is that "rn," if present, is used for making routing
   decisions, and the phone number after "tel:" is used if "rn" is not
   present.

 Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support NP          July 2000



7. Conclusion

   This Internet Draft proposes extensions to the "tel" and "fax" URLs
   described in [TEL] to allow the SIP to carry the NP related
   information in the "tel" and "fax" URLs.  If agreed, it is proposed
   to incorporate the proposed extensions in the next revision of
   RFC2806.

------------------------------------------------------
SIP Bakeoff #5: Advanced Media Testing
unofficial summary for one of the two groups.=20

It was decided that session hold and retrieval did=20
not need to be tested.  However the importance of an
INVITE without SDP to pull a held party off of hold=20
was reiterated for its use by third party call controllers.=20


Scenario 1)=20

Allow a re-INVITE to occur which changes=20
the SDP's connection address and port for an=20
active call.

It was soon decided that the scenario could not
be initiated by the players involved.  If I remember=20
correctly, it was decided that putting the call=20
on hold before the switch invalidated the scenario.

The players in the scenario were Cisco, Nuera,=20
VegaStream and BroadSoft.



Scenario 2)=20

Allow the media codec to change during call setup.

A--B--C
    |
    D

A invites C with B acting as a proxy/controller. =20
A passes two encoder possibilities within the SDP.
C returns 180 with SDP choice 1.
B cancels the invite to C and invites D.
D returns 180 with SDP choice 2 and answers using=20
choice 2.

The test was not completed because of lack of time
before players started leaving for the airport.

Player A was performed by Cisco and Nuera.=20
Player B was BroadSoft.
Players C and D were performed by VegaStream,=20
Pingtel, Vovida, and BroadSoft.


Additional scenario idea for next bakeoff:

Same as scenario 2 but D passes back 180=20
without SDP. =20

Expected result: ringing switches from remote to local.=20

Thanks, I hoped there might be other route exporting approaches that didn't
reinvent the wheel.

I don't see why. We are prescribing the same mechanism for both cases,
right? So it seems silly to create two I-D's that describe the same
mechanism. I imagine that the RTP/AVP-TCP case will mostly simply reference
RFC1890.

hello Sir,
     I was searching for a solution to the rtp problem, to allow
audio/vedio udp packets to pass through the firewall, and then in many
reviews i read about SOCKS v5, i suppose it does something like the
FCP(firewall control protocol) which is in the draft stages. Can anyone
please inform me where i can get an open source for this protocol.
     Thanking you,
      rahul

This is with regard to the torture tests in 
"draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-00.txt"

The SDP announcements in most of those tests (section 8.1 onwards) do 
NOT have `s' & `t' lines. The attached text says that the total SIP
message is `correctly formatting'.

According to the SDP grammar, however, both are mandatory lines.
So, is that an error or not?

[Yes, I know that there was a thread on making the `s' line
optional, but it doesn't seem to have been resolved. Or has it?]

Thanks.



Example attached below:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1 INVITE Parser Torture Test Message

   This message is a correctly formatting SIP message. It contains:

         line folding all over
         escaped characters within quotes
         LWS between colons, semicolons, headers, and other fields
         both comma separated and separate listing of headers
         mix or short and long form for the same header
         unknown header field
         unusual header ordering
         nested comments
         unknown parameters of a known header

   Proxies should forward message and clients should respond as to a
   normal INVITE message.

SIPs usage of SDP must be compliant to rfc2327. As s is mandatory in
SDP, its mandatory to be used when SDP is used within SIP. We should fix
these errors in the call flows document.

This is a really good issue. Thanks for bringing it up.

Seems like there are really just three possibilities:

1. punt this problem; you can't change the parameters before the call is
setup
2. allow reinvites before the 200 OK to change the parameters
3. don't allow early media - send a 200 OK for this instead

None of these are ideal. (2) worries me, as it introduces additional
complexity which I fear will have interactions with other things. (3) is
somewhat appealing, allowing us to return to the simpler model SIP
orginally had. However, people claimed this had nasty interactions with
billing systems and PSTN interworking. I wonder if we can't revisit this
and see if those issues could be resolved some other way?

The difficulty here is that you are choosing to modify one of the
fundamental RTP design choices. RTP uses dynamic ports explicitly
because you might have multiple sessions on the same host; thats why
there is no well known RTP port. Your problem is arising since you want
to discard this decision, use a single port for RTP, and demux based on
source IP address AND source port. Demuxing based on source address and
port info seems mightily dangerous, particulary in the presence of NATs
which routinely modify exactly these things.

I guess your assumption is that if the media streams are always on a
well known port, we can convince firewall admins to allow inbound
connections to that port. I'm doubtful that this would really happen.

We considered this, and came to the conclusion that it was quickly
approaching specialized call processing logic that is best defined
explicitly through CPL or something like that. There are many other
possible interpretations to a mix of proxy and redirect URLs...

I am trying to get this assertion verified at the moment. I was told that
180 (with SDP) should be used for remote ringback (ie early media) and that
183 should _not_ be be used for remote ringback. This does not affect your
arguments. As Jonathan says, if we could make the early media thing go away,
great but until then I think we need to get the situation clarified.

It is my understanding that many people at the bakeoffs are using 183 for
remote ringback. I personally think it is a good thing to keep all the early
media handling under one response code despite some valid arguments that 183
does not necessarily infer that user being alerted (eg, you could be in a
queue).

Cheers,

Robert.

I have a query on the use of whitespace in SIP & SDP grammars.

There are these rules in SDP (rfc 2327):
--------------------------------------------------------------
   origin-field =        "o=" username SPACE
                         sess-id SPACE sess-version SPACE
                         nettype SPACE addrtype SPACE
                         addr CRLF

   email-address =       email "(" email-safe ")" | ...
--------------------------------------------------------------
which leads one to believe that space is allowed _only_ if
explicitly specified in the grammar.

But then there is this example in the rfc:
        e=mjh@isi.edu (Mark Handley)
where there's a space between email & "(".



Similarly, in the SIP grammar (2543bis), there are these rules:
--------------------------------------------------------------
    Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP SIP-Version CRLF
    From = ("From" | "f") ":" (name-addr | addr-spec) 
--------------------------------------------------------------
And yet, the torture tests have
    From   : "J Rosenberg \\\"" <sip:jdrosen@lucent.com> ;


So, what is the right way to interpret the use of whitespace in the grammar?
Should a parser be lenient with whitespace or should it stick to the grammar?

Thanks.

SIP is lenient with LWSs.
So typically one or more LWSes between/before/after tokens should be
accepted.
So the white spaces acceptance of SIP is implicit .


From = {LWS}("From" | "f") ":" {LWS}(name-addr | addr-spec)
but that is typically assumed .

Hence you should be lenient in accepting this.

SDP however, afaik, is very strict on spaces, and does not follow the
leniency
attribute on SIP. Hence, any white space anywhere is explicitly stated and
deviations
are not encompassed.

Hmmmm
I agree that this is something that we need to look at. Or at least get a consensus on it.
I would, sofar I understand the problem, just select option 1 from Jonathon. Setup continues, and if it is not desired anymore, a CANCEL or BYE can be sent (right?). And a change DURING a call (after the media setup has been executed via SDP) will just work with a re-INVITE message.
We just have to accept that we deal with limitations. I cannot call this a real issue. The setup of a SIP call will not take THAT much time after all. Maybe what we can do is a 183 message that tells that user failed to connect, please retry the call.
Or something like that. 

That are my 2 cents

?


This is a really good issue. Thanks for bringing it up.

Seems like there are really just three possibilities:

1. punt this problem; you can't change the parameters before the call is
setup
2. allow reinvites before the 200 OK to change the parameters
3. don't allow early media - send a 200 OK for this instead

None of these are ideal. (2) worries me, as it introduces additional
complexity which I fear will have interactions with other things. (3) is
somewhat appealing, allowing us to return to the simpler model SIP
orginally had. However, people claimed this had nasty interactions with
billing systems and PSTN interworking. I wonder if we can't revisit this
and see if those issues could be resolved some other way?

I assume you mean:

From = ("From" | "f") {LWS} ":" {LWS}(name-addr | addr-spec)

The possible LWS at the beginning of a line will be interpreted
as a continuation newline for the previous line in the message.

I agree with Arjun's answer, and I'll even go a bit further: I think SIP's
leniency is expressed in the following statement -

"Except where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included
between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and between
adjacent tokens and separators, without changing the interpretation of a
field." (Appendix C),

and that means that as concerns SIP you can - and must - be lenient with the
whitespace *and* stick to the grammar :-)

As for SDP, part of the answer lies in the fact that rfc2327 claims that
"email" syntax is "defined in RFC822", and if you look up rfc 822 you'll see
that they have roughly the same statement as SIP regarding white space:

"To aid in the creation and reading of structured  fields,  the free
insertion of linear-white-space (which permits folding by inclusion of
CRLFs) is  allowed  between  lexical  tokens". In particular, '(' is an
RFC822 token (for comments) so you can consider, without stretching too much
the texts of the various RFCs, that the examples are indeed compliant with
the grammars of the respective fields.

Best regards,
Laurent Steffan

hello,
     I was wondering that once the TCP transport port is registered under 
IANA will we still require the MESSAGE header(presently in the drafts stage) 
since a line such as :
         m=text <port> tcp plain
     with other a= attributes proposed for tcp will solve the problem for 
instant messaging.
     Thanking you all,
        rahul

Hi

When I was doing some background reading on the SIP protocol, I came
accross some references to SIP+.  Could anyone point me to a good source
of information which covers SIP+

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

Christopher

This is covered in the SIP FAQ at
	http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip

SIP+ was a proposal by Level3 on how to extend SIP to
interconnect 
two MGCs. This functionality is now being provided by various 
orthogonal SIP extensions, including the carriage of multipart
MIME 
types, the INFO method and others. These are being documented in
a 
BCP draft. The name SIP+ is obsolete and should not be used to
avoid 
confusion. 

Also check out the latest Internet Draft on SIP-T:
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vemuri-sip-t-context-00.txt

Another query on SDP grammar:

[If this isn't the right forum for SDP related questions, please let
me know.]

Consider the following in rfc 2327:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   IP4-address =         b1 "." decimal-uchar "." decimal-uchar "." b4

   decimal-uchar =       ("1" 2*(DIGIT))
                         | ...

   DIGIT =               "0" | POS-DIGIT
   POS-DIGIT =           "1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"6"|"7"|"8"|"9"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there a mistake in the following production?
    decimal-uchar = ("1" 2*(DIGIT))

I ask because there's a similar rule for IPv4 addresses in the 
SIP-URL grammar (2543bis).
  IPv4address     = 1*3DIGIT"."1*3DIGIT"."1*3DIGIT"."1*3DIGIT
This rule unambiguously states that each token between the '.'
must not be more than 3 digits.

But SDP's ("1" 2*(DIGIT)) rule seems to suggest any number beginning
with a "1" and having atleast 3 digits.

Thanks.

That is correct :-)

(On a related note: A few days ago, someone pointed out an interesting case
of one line having a string without an ending quote, but slashed at the
end, the next line having an LWS and then some text and then the
terminating quote. - in which case I guess we cannot ignore the LWS
like we usually do for continuation lines". Just thought I'd re-mention
this interesting "torture" test wrt all our continuation line parsing
routines
we have in our implementations:-) )

I assume you mean:

From = ("From" | "f") {LWS} ":" {LWS}(name-addr | addr-spec)

The possible LWS at the beginning of a line will be interpreted
as a continuation newline for the previous line in the message.

I'd reread RFC 2234 on ABNF as you are misreading this.

How does it solve instant messaging, by simply registering an IANA port and
specifying m= line as you say ?

Which method do you send it in ? Where do you encapsulate the actual text ?
Would you want to overload INVITE yet again ? (also invite requires the
INV-OK-ACK negotiation cycle - doesnt make
sense for an IM message going forward)
Other methods like INFO , BYE etc already have a specific application .
(Actually the way it seems to be going now is that INFO is so generic that
it doesnt seem to be used much at all !:-p !)

I would say MESSAGE (Its a method, not a header) is still very much
required.
There are other advantages of using a different method (one is proxies who
do not support IM can simply
return "Method not supproted" whenever a MESSAGE comes across, instead of
trying to decipher if it was a method
it allowed, which is encapsulating an IM behaviour - etc. ) See the impp
drafts for more details.

Subject:  [SIP] Instant Messaging....




hello,
     I was wondering that once the TCP transport port is registered under
IANA will we still require the MESSAGE header(presently in the drafts
stage)
since a line such as :
         m=text <port> tcp plain
     with other a= attributes proposed for tcp will solve the problem for
instant messaging.
     Thanking you all,
        rahul

Is this really a misread ?

RFC 2234 states:

"The operator "*" preceding an element indicates repetition. The full form
is:

             <a>*<b>element

     where <a> and <b> are optional decimal values, indicating at least

        <a> and at most <b> occurrences of element.

     Default values are 0 and infinity so that *<element> allows any
number, including zero; 1*<element> requires at least one; 3*3<element>
allows
     exactly 3 and 1*2<element> allows one or two. "

So

("1" 2*(DIGIT))

Would mean 1 followed by _at least_ 2 more digits, which I guess is not the
 intention.

I'd reread RFC 2234 on ABNF as you are misreading this.

Sorry, I'll reread 2234 you're right this should be ("1" 2*2(DIGIT)) in
the context of the rules you snipped. I don't know if this has been
brought up on the confcntrl mailing list though.

do you mean, for example something like:

Header: headerStuff ;param="This is a
   wrapped quoted string"

i dont think we can really expect implementations to maintain the
quantity of white space within the quoted parameter.

Section C.1 (page 118 of bis-01)

"SIP header field values can be folded onto multiple lines if the
continuation line begins with a space or horizontal tab. All linear
white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP. A
recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream."

whether it is in a quoted string or not i think is irrelevant.  it
still MAY be interpreted as a single white space.

Hi,

"SIP Caller cannot Hold/ChangeSDP during call setup with Early Media"

At 11:35 AM 8/17/00 +0200, Arnoud van Wijk (ETM) wrote:

How much time is tolerable ?

Apparently there are Telco, on PRI-ISDN links, that do not deliver Q.931 
Connect *at all*, to be confirmed.

On other PSTN numbers, Connect is delivered after one minute. The offending 
PSTN numbers are often 800 style numbers.

PSTN & AIN experts can probably explain this.

If we agree that this is an issue, I am begining to suspect that some "200 
OK Cause=Early Media" + callee initiated "re-INVITE, Cause=SessionProgress" 
could be a viable solution, because it would work with existing 
implementations (it also removes the issue of the reliability of 
provisional responses, if we extend its usage to all calls, not just ones 
with EarlyMedia). I am not a SIP expert so please be forgiving, I am 
willing to learn. Thanks.

Yours,

Jean-Hugues Robert.

In my understanding of SIP, this issue is not really related to 183
messages. The end of section 4.2.1 states that "A UAC MUST be prepared
to receive media data according to the session description as soon as it
sends an INVITE...". I cannot find a symmetrical sentence for UAS in the
draft, something like "A UAS MAY send media data according to the
session description as soon it receives an INVITE...". If this is true,
then the caller can receive data media without receiving a SDP (which
will may be used for sending media data). 

(1) works, we have just to discard data media received if the UAC is in
hold state (and the UAC can use another RTP port pair to establish
another call). But what if the INVITE is forked - In this case we can
receive multiple data media on the same port.

I agree that (2) complicates things.

For (3), perhaps we can change the 4.2.1 section to state that media
data can be send (and receive) only when a 200 OK is receive (send),
forbidding SDP on provisional responses and adding a header to signal
the "billed" part of the call, so we can imagine the following call
flow:


 UAC                       UAS                       PSTN
  |     INVITE F1           |                         |

Since the TCP transport protocol I have in mind is not RTP, I am doing no 
such thing.

Once you have a NAT, the source port is the least of your problems, since 
the source IP address is also munged.  This is where SIP ALPs come into 
play, and there's no reason why even a basic SIP ALP can't handle both 
address and port translation.

Your guess is incorrect.  The reason (among several) to have fixed ports on 
the "passive" side is not to convince firewall admins to allow inbound 
connections to that port, but rather to convince the hyper-paranoid 
firewall admins to allow *outbound* connections to that port.  The topology 
is that the UA advertising "passive" is not behind a firewall, which allows 
UAs which *are* behind a firewall to (a) not require inbound connections, 
and (b) only have a single outbound port open.  Asking an admin to open an 
outbound port on 2392 (for example) so that users can make use of a 
well-defined SIP-based service is a lot different than asking "gee, can you 
open ports 6000-8000?"

Ok, fine by me, just asking. :-)

The nagging thought I have is: what does it mean to have a bidirectional 
media flow over RTP/AVP-TCP?  Is it simply that RTP media packets are sent 
down one side of a single TCP connection and RTCP control packets are sent 
back the other side?  So then for a bidirectional flow you'd have two TCP 
connections, one for each media direction?

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but as you may have guessed I'm not an 
RTP expert.

I just re-read the previous thread about this - it did not exactly address
what I was referring to.

In the prev. thread, it was mentioned that:

<quote>
To: "Some string\[CR][LF]
continued

Only the CR is escaped. The LF begins another line and would need to be
indented.

On the other hand

To: "Some string\[CR]
continued"

is just a single line.
</quote>

So expanding the above case

To: "Some string\[CR]
                    continued"

should preserve LWS then ?


Also what about:

To: "Some string\[CR][LF]
                    continued"

do we ignore LWS or not in front while forming the string ?

do you mean, for example something like:

Header: headerStuff ;param="This is a
   wrapped quoted string"

i dont think we can really expect implementations to maintain the
quantity of white space within the quoted parameter.

Section C.1 (page 118 of bis-01)

"SIP header field values can be folded onto multiple lines if the
continuation line begins with a space or horizontal tab. All linear
white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP. A
recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream."

whether it is in a quoted string or not i think is irrelevant.  it
still MAY be interpreted as a single white space.

These are the kind of anomalies that are to be expected when nested
calls are introduced. I believe when we had this discussion last time it
all got down to billing eventually. I guess most people would agree that
(ideally at least) the signaling protocol shouldn't depend on billing.
Option 3 seems much preferable to me - avoid doing early media and set
up legs properly. Option 2 is just an abomination.

One possible source of confusion is that the definition of "isomorphic"
includes both requests and responses, but the RFCbis never uses the word
"isomorphic" in relation to responses.

I'm not sure that there is any particular significance to isomorphic
responses. For example, if the UAS sends a 183 to start an early media
session, and then sends a second 183 to modify that session, the two 183's
are isomorphic, but they are not identical and both need to be processed.

On the other hand, the draft on reliable provisional responses doesn't use
the word "isomorphic". Perhaps isomorphic reliable provisional responses
should be defined there, and the definition would need to include matching
RSeqs.

For clarity, I agree that the rfc2543 should mention what receiving 180,
181, 182, 183 with an SDP for an INVITE explicitly means.

If A receives 18x with SDP from B, can/should A start sending to B?  I
assume no for 180 and yes for 181, 182 and 183 but I have not found it
explicitly stated anywhere.

There were some test cases that I was hoping to test at the bakeoff, but
didn't get the chance.  Text relating to the test cases may be useful in the
rfc.

- A invites B.  B replies 180 with SDP.  B then replies 180 without SDP.
Expected result: A should start providing local ringback.

- A invites B with multiple codecs.  B replies 180 SDP with codec 0; then B
replies 180 SDP with codec 2.  Expected result: A should stop using codec 0
and start using codec 2.

- A invites B.  A forking proxy was involved.  A forking proxy returned two
18x with SDP and different "TO" tags.  Should the received media be mixed?
 I assume no until maybe after having received a 200 on one of the legs.

My understanding is that the 183 draft is expired, and any aspects from
the draft that were to be adopted have been pulled into rfc2543bis.

The reason for the problem here is that functionality in SIP isn't as
clearly layered as it could be. Early media mixes up call setup and bearer
setup layers. Sticking to option 3 separates call setup into one layer and
media setup into another. This simplifies the protocol - we should do this
if at all possible.

These are the kind of anomalies that are to be expected when nested
calls are introduced. I believe when we had this discussion last time it
all got down to billing eventually. I guess most people would agree that
(ideally at least) the signaling protocol shouldn't depend on billing.
Option 3 seems much preferable to me - avoid doing early media and set
up legs properly. Option 2 is just an abomination.

I agree that option 2 adds too much complexity to SIP.

However I think that early media is very useful for ip-telephony;
thus I would hate to see option 3 get adopted.  I just feel that
early media needs to be more explicitly defined;
please see "Remote ringback" thread.

I think that if the caller needs to change SDP,
the caller needs to wait until after the call is
answered before sending a message with the new SDP.

Unless considered a violation by the Transfer draft,
the following is an overkill strange possibility.
The caller can REFER the called party back to caller and
provide the new SDP in the 200rsp, and CANCEL the
original INVITE before the called party answers.  When
the original called party answers, the SDP is passed in
the ACK.

Hello.

I'm having a little doubt about port numbers in sip addresses. I know
that, for the UAS (at least), there is a default port number (5060). My
question is:

i - should I use the same port for the UAC
ii - another specific port, like 5061 or
iii - ANY_PORT?

With the first case (which I have been trying to implement because I
believe it's the right one), I'm having some trouble because both UAS
and UAC are simultaneously listening for requests and responses
respectively, and the only solution I could think of for routing
incoming SIP messages (requests or responses) to the right listener, was
(for both caller party and called party the UAS listening was initially
enabled and UAC listening disabled):

(for the caller)
disabling UAS listening
enabling UAC listening
sending the initial INVITE through the UAC
receiving a response
disabling UAC listening
enabling UAS listening
sending ACK through the UAC

(and for the callee)
receiving a request
sending a response.

Another pseudo-solution to this is (which I believe to be incorrect)
implementing a message interpreter under the UAS & UAC. This entity
would receive the incoming network packets, find out what kind of SIP
message has arrived (request or response) and deliver it to the right
listener.

With the second case, should the UAC port number be part of the From
field in an outgoing SIP request, so the responding UAS would know where
to send its message?

And finally, in the last case, how would the remote UAS know where to
send its response?

I hope anyone can help me on this. Please tell me of any other solutions
you may know about, including those which would show I'm completely
insane and ignorant on SIP.

Thanks.
(I'm sorry for the long message)

The port for UAC is used for responses. You can get responses on any
port you want. If its not 5060, you include that port in the Via header
of the outgoing request.

For the legal loop detection hash calculation,
Why do we need the From and To to compute the hash?
I suppose the ReqURI and the CallID are sufficient to compute
the hash!!

The use of cSeq number as mentioned in the rfc2543bis would
be a problem issue since if the proxy insists on being on the
path, a reinvite won't have the same cSeq number.

By using to, from call-ID and CSeq, you get the nice property that the
branch-ID of the request is a complete transaction identifier. But,
this is an implementation dcision. As far as the algorithm is concerned
(detecting spirals), request URI alone is all that is needed.

Huh? This is a totally separate transaction.

Right. I keep forgetting you aren't interested in RTP. I am clearly

These kinds of things have been hashed out endlessly on various IETF
mailing lists. It all comes down to this: designing protocols to meet
assumed policies of firewall administrators is a dangerous game. These
policies change all the time, and what works today may not work
tomorrow.

I think it could work in several ways. You could have both directions of
RTP over the same TCP connection, along with the RTCP, or over two
connections.

I'm not sure here. The rules in SIP regarding implicit LWS apply only to
between words (where words include tokens and quoted strings - the
entire quoted string, that is) and separators, and between tokens. The
space inside of a quoted string does not meet the definitions of
implicit LWS. 

However, I think you also would need to escape the CR and/or LF that
might appear, so that you can detect headers without parsing the headers
themselves.

It isn't. SDP queries belong on confctrl@isi.edu.

The BNF is correct. You need to examine complete production for
decimal-uchar:

>  decimal-uchar =       DIGIT
>                          | POS-DIGIT DIGIT
>                          | ("1" 2*(DIGIT))

>                          | ("2" "5" ("0"|"1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"))

The production defines one of five rules; the first covers the numbers
0-9. The second covers 10 through 99. The thrid 100 through 199 (thus a
1 followed by two digits), the fourth 200 through 249, and the final,
250 through 255. Thus, the overall production for decimal-uchar allows
any number from 0 to 255, which is correct.

Right, but the third production also allows 
1000 through 1999, 10000 through 19999 ...

That is, it doesn't restrict the length of decimal-uchar to three
digits like the fourth & fifth productions do, does it?

It seems to allow more than just 0 to 255, hence the query.
Thanks.

hello all,
  I had a query regarding a call flow in SIP. The caller sends me a recvonly 
request for a unicast session which i want to reject, how do i reply to his 
request :
The request which i have received is as follows :

   CALLER :
          INVITE....
          ..........

          v=0
          ..........
          m=audio 3241 rtp/avp 0
          a=recvonly
          m=vedio 3245 rtp/avp 1

I want to reject his first media stream, can someone please tell me what 
will be the response.

         Thanking you all,
           rahul

You could do this kind of thing today with the text over RTP
specification.

Anyway, this is really a different service than IM. Namely:

1. its a streaming text service; data is sent character at a time rather
than in groups of messages
2. IM can have store and forward services implemented with them; this is
much harder if not impossible with a streaming text service.
3. streaming text requires explicit creation and termination of a
session. Messagin, by its nature, can be done without such setup.

I have some slides on this subject at:

I would suggest 403 Forbidden response (server understands the request but
refuses to fulfill it), or 415 Unsupported Media type.  I would go for 403.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  It seems that allowing an escaped
[CR] or [LF] in a string will lead to problems.  For example, how do you
interpret the next lines:

X-Organization:  "A conspiracy organisation \[LF]
X-From:  "Some alien \[LF]
From: outer space" <mission@face.mars.uni>[LF]

Within a string, the backslash works as an escape, so the [LF] is
not interpreted as a end of line and the next line is
part of a continued line, eventhough it doesn't start with
whitespace (if I interpret the ABNF grammar for quoted strings
correctly).  However, you can't determine whether the backslash
is part of a string or not, especially when extension fields
are used.  In the above example, the X-Organization field is
followed by an UTF8-Text, so double-quotes and backslashes are
not interpreted.  The X-From field contains a string, so the
backslash should be interpreted and the next line (starting
with "From: ") is part of string.  However, a parser will be
unable to determine whether a quoted-string or UTF8-text
is used, so it has to handle both cases similarly.

Therefore, the statement in Section C.1 (page 118 of bis-01),
as quoted above, should be stronger and state that the ONLY
way to continue a line is indenting the next line.  The backslash
at the end of a line should be regarded as an error if it appears
within a quoted string, which can be achieved by changing the
definition of quoted-pair to something link:

qouted-pair  = "\" <any CHAR except CR and LF>

For SIP to be efficient and quick, as i'm sure you'll agree it must be,
it MUST be possible to parse in a message with out having to parse each
individual header.

Ignoring the \CR and \LF, it is possible to get the structure of the
messages and the headers split up by looking for the combination of
CR, LF and white space indentation. great, this can be done quickly by
simple byte-by-byte comparison.

This all goes out the window however when we allow, or expect, that in
`special cases' a `\' at the end of the line actually marks another
form of continuation.

for example, parsing the fast, efficient, lazy way, the header:

Waring: 307 foo "some info \
some more info"

Will be parsed as 2 headers, with the second header being very wrong
and breaking everything.

If we want this to be parsed properly, then from the very begining we
have to parse the header and understand it.

So what if we don't understand it?

eg.

foo: foodata "\
To: sip:a@b

how do we parse this?  we know nothing about the header.  is it a quoted
string, or does it just happen that the " is present?

this is impossible to parse.

I think the BNF in Section C.1 (page 119 bis-01) is wrong where it says:

quoted-pair = "\"CHAR

perhaps it should be:

quoted-pair = "\" (0x00-09 | 0x0B-0C | 0x0E-0x7F)

i.e. remove CR and LF from the quoted pair.

or should we go further and remove all control characters:

quoted-pair = "\" (0x20 - 0x7E | 0x09) (including SP and TAB)

thoughts?

Hi, I don't want to reject the whole message but only the first media 
stream, I'm still accepting the second media stream.

You would send a 200 OK, the body of that response would contain your

Sir,I was refering to the INVITE method only.

Sir,Its only the initial call setup overhead just like for any other media 
communication, but once they have agreed to the media type then only the tcp 
connection will be there over which chunk of data will be passed. In this 
case you require to use the parsers processing the SIP headers initially 
only, just like any other RTP request,  but later we will just have data 
sent over a tcp connection.

Sir, It can de detected otherwise also by seeing the m= line in the session 
description. Okay ur right that with the MESSAGE header it will be 
instantaneous but don't u think that things like 'chat' can be handled at 
the SDP level(with TCP) rather than increasing complexity at the SIP level
In the instant messaging case a text/plain message will always be 
accompanied by a MESSAGE method (Please correct me if i'm wrong). So in this 
scenario everytime we receive this request we need to do the whole SIP 
processing (like parsing, generating headers for 200OK etc..), but with the 
"m=text <port> tcp plain" line in SDP in an INVITE request will require the 
SIP processing(just like above) only initially but later no SIP processing 
is required and simple data will be sent over the tcp connection which has 
been established.

hi,
It might sound silly but can u tell me exactly how should i respond to the 
request, it will be a 200OK response and i should have one to one mapping 
"m=" lines in that case what will be the contents of my first "m=" line in 
the example specified above.
    Thanking you,
       rahul

Jonathan..
thou art the master! :-)

I am seriously looking at SIP and charging. I think that your proposed idea for method #3 looks quite doable.
This will only work if this header is mandatory..else the SIP proxy has no idea WHEN to start the charging timer.
Maybe a good idea to have this header X-Media (maybe call it Charging-Flag?)
This would then look like:

Charging-Flag = "Charging-Flag" ":" flag
flag = "off"|"standby"|"on"
Session timer timeout or a BYE/CANCEL will indicate end of session and thus end of charging.

An advantage is that it is possible at a later time to give the option NOT to charge for a session (flag = "off").
This will enable flatrate or free calling for certain sessions..like text only sessions for deaf callers (after all..text is not really that resource hungry compared to video and speech).

My 2 Euro cents.
  
Arnoud

In my understanding of SIP, this issue is not really related to 183
messages. The end of section 4.2.1 states that "A UAC MUST be prepared
to receive media data according to the session description as soon as it
sends an INVITE...". I cannot find a symmetrical sentence for UAS in the
draft, something like "A UAS MAY send media data according to the
session description as soon it receives an INVITE...". If this is true,
then the caller can receive data media without receiving a SDP (which
will may be used for sending media data). 

(1) works, we have just to discard data media received if the UAC is in
hold state (and the UAC can use another RTP port pair to establish
another call). But what if the INVITE is forked - In this case we can
receive multiple data media on the same port.

I agree that (2) complicates things.

For (3), perhaps we can change the 4.2.1 section to state that media
data can be send (and receive) only when a 200 OK is receive (send),
forbidding SDP on provisional responses and adding a header to signal
the "billed" part of the call, so we can imagine the following call
flow:


 UAC                       UAS                       PSTN

Does anyone know of any legacy systems that work this way?  If there isn't 
RTP/TCP code that already picks a strategy, then it seems like this should 
be nailed down to one approach or the other.  If we're going to insist that 
implementors have the flexibility to choose (far be it for me to demand 
less flexibility :-) ) then at the very least there must be a way for SDP 
to describe the approach being used.

I can think of at least three ways to arrange the streams:

a) Each media stream has two TCP connections: one to send the media using 
RTP/AVP packets, and one to return RTCP packets.  A bidirectional media 
session would therefore consist of four (!) TCP connections, each being 
used unidirectionally.

b) Each media stream has a single TCP connection: one side of the 
connection sends the media using RTP/AVP packets, the other side returns 
the RTCP packets.  A bidirectional media session would therefore consist of 
two TCP connections, each connection mapping to one media direction.

c) A bidirectional media stream consist of two TCP connections: one 
connection contains the two RTCP streams and the other contains the two 
RTP/AVP media packets.

I'm sure if you wanted to get pathological you could combine the above 
three baselines to arrive at even more permutations.  Philosophically I 
like (b) the best, but I'll be the first to admit that my experience in 
this area is thin and I could see where (c) might be preferable.

The first high-order bit to set is whether we are going to define a fixed 
approach to RTP/AVP-TCP or enumerate the stream-to-connection mappings and 
allow UAs to choose.  I would argue that for interoperability purposes it 
would be wise to choose the former.

Thoughts?

At a philosophical level I agree that tap-dancing around firewalls is bound 
to get your toes stubbed eventually.  Nevertheless, I still believe that my 
original assertion is true: reducing the footprint of the firewall pinhole 
tends to reduce the friction through the firewall.  It's self-defeating to 
pass up an opportunity to gain some ground on the problem with the argument 
of "you may win the battle, but you'll never win the war."

And like I said, firewalls are but one reason to allow SDP to describe 
TCP-based services that accept on a fixed port (interoperability with 
legacy TCP-based protocols comes to mind).  It just seems like allowing 
(ALLOWING, *not* requiring) the initiator of the TCP connection to announce 
the source port is a potentially useful addition that isn't in the category 
of undue complexity in the protocol.

Hello,

we would like to start a discussion about the possibility of making 
SIP more simple than today. We realize that it's a little late to
make big changes in the protocol at this stage but the change we
propose seems quite small. This proposal is our personal proposal 
and is not in any way reflecting the Ericsson point of view 
(not yet anyway).

We feel that SIP today is unnecessary complex which costs time
during development and testing of a SIP parser. It also cost 
execution time which we can see no reason for. Maybe there are 
historic reasons why SIP is specified as it is but since the 
specification does not explain this (which it shouldn't) we 
can't see the reason for certain constructions. We understand 
that HTTP has been a great influence when specifying SIP but 
we have not heard any explanation why. 

In general we think SIP allows too many optional ways of doing things. 
Each of these options cost development time, testing time and 
execution time in every SIP enabled product. And since some SIP
UA most likely is small devices with limited processor power, memory
size etc. it must be interesting to reduce the amount of code
needed to parse the SIP messages. 
Every option also adds the possibility of introducing bugs which 
we noticed during the last bakeoff. So by making SIP more 
simple we think it will be easier to develop SIP enabled products 
with better quality in shorter time. This would at the end help 
spreading SIP even faster than today which we hope everyone is 
interested in doing (at least in this mail group). 

So what we basically suggest is that only the canonical representation
should be used. All other formats should be depricated in the same
way as the different ways of terminating the SIP-headers was depricated
some time ago. In this way SIP will still be backwards-compatible 
since everyone has to be able to receive the canonical representation.
It will just take some time for everyone to adapt their code so
they only send out the canonical representation. After a while it's 
possible to make a new version of SIP that only allows the canonical
form. Then it's up to everyone to decide if they want to support
both SIP 2.0 as well as the new version or only the new version.

According to the SIP specification (chapter 13.2 in rfc2543bis-01) 
the canonical representation restricts the SIP syntax in this way :

* No short form header fields;   
* Header field names are capitalized as shown in the rfc;   
* No white space between the header name and the colon;   
* A single space after the colon;   
* Line termination with a CRLF;   
* No line folding;   
* No comma separated lists of header values; each must appear as a
separate header;   
* Only a single SP between tokens, between tokens and quoted strings,
and between quoted strings; no SP after last token or quoted string;   
* No LWS between tokens and separators, except as described above for
after the colon in header fields;   
* The To and From header fields always include the < and > delimiters
even if the display-name is empty. 

We can't see any problem in any of these restrictions. Some of them
only restricts how many white space characters you are allowed to use 
so those restrictions can't be any problem to introduce. Why send extra
spaces that only adds unnecessary bytes to the messages ?

To disallow the compact form of the headers might be a problem but
since using the compact form only saves about 70-80 bytes a UA still
have to be able to handle the case where the message don't fit in
one MTU. If this is a real problem why not define a compact form 
for _all_ headers in SIP and only use that form ? 

To capitalize the header field names exactly as they are specified
in the RFC does not seem to be a problem either. Why should it be
possible to write e.g. Content-Length as cOnTeNt-lEnGtH ?

Line folding is also something we can't see any reason for. Since
all UA/Servers have to be able to _receive_ any length of a header 
line why can't they _send_ every header in one line ?  

To allow a comma separated list in the Via and Record-Route etc.
is one of the optional things that seems unnecessary. Especially 
since it creates longer lines which means you might need line folding.
Since all UA that intend to handle Authentication have to use the 
canonical representation anyway why not always use it ?

We realize that it's a little bit late in the SIP development to
make changes in the protocol but we feel that these changes are 
not very big since it's already specified in the RFC. 

If everyone is happy with todays specification we can live with 
it too since we have already implemented it. But we feel that it 
would help SIP to spread faster in the future by making it as 
simple as possible to parse.  

So what do you think. Is this proposal something you think
is worth introducing or is it better to keep things as it is ?

If you just want to reject the first media stream the 200 response should 0 
the port for the meadia streams you want to reject. This is explained in
detail in appendix B of the latest draft and the RFC. You have to respond
one to one for each m line sent to you.

i agree.

the sip specification is not easy to implement, for the main reason
that you have to be able to accept the same information in many
different ways.

conforming to the canonicial form should not be a hardship for anyone
and will make everyone's implementations faster thanx to a, probably
quite noticable, efficiency gain.

hi,
   A callee responding to the first media stream will basically be sending a 
"a=sendonly" response for that "m=" media stream. So when you reply back to 
the requester in the above manner, the caller receiving this response would 
interprert the following for the first "m=" media stream :

       1) Since its a one to one mapping for his "a=recvonly" request, he 
would logically assume that the reply is "a=sendonly", even if the callee is 
accepting a media stream there is no hard and fast rule that he should 
respond with a "a=" line, its logically understood.

       2) The SIP rfc states that :

    " For send-only streams, the address and port number
   have no significance and SHOULD be set to zero. "

         Through the above statement a callee who wants to accept the media 
stream might also put a port no. as 0 in his reply.

       So, i hope u understand what i am trying to say i.e. even if the 
responder is wanting to accept the requested first media stream, the SIP rfc 
recommends him to put the port to 0. Now how will he reject the offer. Its a 
race condition.
       Please let me know if i have not been clear in explaining my doubt or 
if its just a silly one.

      Thanking you,
          rahul

I agree. In my coffee-starved state of mind I apparently believed the
escaping would help, but it doesn't. So, I think we need to specify that
if a CR, LF, or CRLF appears in a quoted string, these MUST be properly
line folded.

I believe rahul's question is aimed at a slight inconsistency in
appendix B.2, which says:

> For receive-only and send-or-receive streams, the port number and
>    address in the session description indicate where the media stream
>    should be sent to by the recipient of the session description, either
>    caller or callee. For send-only streams, the address and port number
>    have no significance and SHOULD be set to zero.

So, the caller sends a stream recvonly. So, the callee wishes to accept
it. Clearly its sendonly from their perspective. According to the above,
the port is set to zero. But, later on:

> If caller and callee have no media formats in common for a particular
>    stream, the callee MUST return a session description containing the
>    particular "m=" line, but with the port number set to zero, and no
>    payload types listed.

which says its set to zero as well, but with no payload types. That
would be fine, and there would be no inconsistency here. However, we
have observed this to be inconsistent with rfc2327, which mandates at
least one codec there:

> media-field =         "m=" media space port ["/" integer]
>                          space proto 1*(space fmt) CRLF


Sooo, what is the significance of port zero in the response to INVITE
for an offered recvonly stream responded with sendonly?

I believe the solution is that we modify the latter text in SIP to read:

> For receive-only and send-or-receive streams, the port number and
>    address in the session description indicate where the media stream
>    should be sent to by the recipient of the session description, either
>    caller or callee. For send-only streams, the address and port number
>    have no significance and MAY be set to any value, but MUST NOT be set to zero.

i.e., we have port zero mean ONE THING only - refusal of a media stream.

If I had it over again, I would eliminate line folding, case
insensitivity, and a host of other things. But, when the spec was begun,
it was decided that rather than inventing new syntax, we would borrow
from a clearly successful, highly interoperable, well understood
protocol for which a whole lot of code was available. That meant we
inherited the good along with the bad. 

Because we must be backwards compatible with rfc2543, there is no choice
but to insist implementations handle line folding and other things (in
reality its not so bad once you construct a tokenizer than knows about
line folding. In this way, it is handled once. My old C code for this
was on the order of 50 lines). We could have rfc2543bis insist on
sending in some canonical form, but it won't help parsers which must
anyway handle the various forms. I suppose eventually those could be
phased out, but there is a fair amount of SIP out there already, so I
don't know that non-canonical form would be gone that soon.

Oops, you're right. This BNF is wrong; it should be:

...
| ("1" 2DIGIT)
...

This should be corrected in the draft version.

So long as its not mandatory, I can live with that. So, is the proposal
made previously
regarding indication of source port:

OK? If so, lets declare this done, get an I-D written, and move forward
here.

I am not sure to agree with this. 
SIP is not so difficult to parse and adding such restrictions can have a
negative impact on my personal SIP protocol analyzer (The one I have in
my head :-). 
Text-based protocols (HTTP, MGCP, Megaco, SMTP, POP3...) have this
characteristic that they can be easily used with language like Perl,
Java and even directly with telnet. I think this restrictions look like
a step in direction of a binary protocol.

Just my opinion.

Well, as there is no way to even indicate RTP over TCP in SDP, we are
treading 
new ground here.

The idea was it doesn't really matter. If I have two connections open, I
simply listen on both and take whatever I receive and process it as if
it was all received on one connection. The timestamps, SSRC, sequence
numbers and what have you give me everything I need to process the RTP
and RTCP.

If there must be two connections, this seems the most likely case. I
don't feel
terribly strongly here, but as I argue above, it seems like you can send
anything on any of the open connections; so long as you listen on all it 
should work fine.

According to rfc2234:

Thus, Nelement and N*Nelement are the same.

I would strongly debate against changing the existing semantics of
18x messages. We have discussed 18x too much and had arrived on this
semantics of 183 . The 183 draft is clear on what needs to be done with
the response and what does an SDP mean in 183.

The original concept of 180 (with or without SDP) and 183 (with SDP always)
works fine for all the scenarios today.

For a UAS willing to feed any ringback /early media or announcements, the
choice of
183 with SDP is there.
These messages were thought about carefully and they mapped to ALERTING and
PROGRESS events from PSTN world. Any change in semantics like using a generic
200 OK (As suggested in option 3) for all events then using SIP headers to
decide
what to do might be an overkill.
Think about the SIP drafts which are already under review based on this logic.

I still have concerns about :
1) Why a need to distinguish a remote ringback case from a remote media ?
2) If  the caller wishes to change the media before the call is established,
the option 2 of sending re-INVITE is the most logical way to do.
Agreed, that it is a pain; but so is everything down the lane when
QoS/PRACK/COMET/
3pcc/ INVITE with DELAYED media et a.


Comments ?

thanks

<br>I would strongly debate against changing the existing semantics of
<br>18x messages. We have discussed 18x too much and had arrived on this
<br>semantics of 183 . The 183 draft is clear on what needs to be done
with
<br>the response and what does an SDP mean in 183.
<p>The original concept of 180 (with or without SDP) and 183 (with SDP
always)
<br>works fine for all the scenarios today.
<p>For a UAS willing to feed any ringback /early media or announcements,
the choice of
<br>183 with SDP is there.
<br>These messages were thought about carefully and they mapped to ALERTING
and
<br>PROGRESS events from PSTN world. Any change in semantics like using
a generic
<br>200 OK (As suggested in option 3) for all events then using SIP headers
to decide
<br>what to do might be an overkill.
<br>Think about the SIP drafts which are already under review based on
this logic.
<p>I still have concerns about :
<br>1) Why a need to distinguish a remote ringback case from a remote media
?
<br>2) If&nbsp; the caller wishes to change the media before the call is
established,
<br>the option 2 of sending re-INVITE is the most logical way to do.
<br>Agreed, that it is a pain; but so is everything down the lane when
QoS/PRACK/COMET/
<br>3pcc/ INVITE&nbsp;with DELAYED media et a.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Comments ?

<br>Subject: Re: [SIP] Media &amp; Signaling inter-dependencies, issue
with 183 ?
<p>> These are the kind of anomalies that are to be expected when nested
<br>> calls are introduced. I believe when we had this discussion last
time it
<br>> all got down to billing eventually. I guess most people would agree
that
<br>> (ideally at least) the signaling protocol shouldn't depend on billing.
<br>> Option 3 seems much preferable to me - avoid doing early media and
set
<br>> up legs properly. Option 2 is just an abomination.
<p>I agree that option 2 adds too much complexity to SIP.
<p>However I think that early media is very useful for ip-telephony;
<br>thus I would hate to see option 3 get adopted.&nbsp; I just feel that
<br>early media needs to be more explicitly defined;
<br>please see "Remote ringback" thread.
<p>I think that if the caller needs to change SDP,
<br>the caller needs to wait until after the call is
<br>answered before sending a message with the new SDP.
<p>Unless considered a violation by the Transfer draft,
<br>the following is an overkill strange possibility.
<br>The caller can REFER the called party back to caller and
<br>provide the new SDP in the 200rsp, and CANCEL the
<br>original INVITE before the called party answers.&nbsp; When
<br>the original called party answers, the SDP is passed in
<br>the ACK.

The motivation for introducing the early media concept, and the various
solutions were explored in the original 183 draft, which appears to have
expired, as it is no longer on the IETF site.  However, it can be found at:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-183-00.txt

It is an interworking issue that has billing implications, not a billing
issue.  I will not go into it here, as it has been documented already.

I am certainly willing to explore other methods for solving this
interworking issue.  However, I would suspect that there are a number of
implementations out there that have implemented early media with 183.
Please also remember that there were a number of proposals discussed on the
list for other creative uses of the early media concept.

I have also seen it proposed in this and other threads that the ability to
attach SDP to a provisional response should be removed from the bis draft.
Doing so would break the QoS and security solutions documented in:

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-01.txt

I suspect that the same issue raised about early media also applies to the
use of SDP in a 18x message for the purpose of setting up QoS and security
relationships.

It may not be the cleanest solution, but I vote for number 1 and making it a
client problem to handle changing of the IP address during session setup.

Having had a look at the granddaddy of SIP syntax, RFC 822, it seems to
me that the SIP spec is no more and no less vague on when CR and LF are
allowed in quoted strings and what they mean than 822 is.  The
definitions are pretty much the same as far as I can tell.

From rfc822:

     quoted-string = <"> *(qtext/quoted-pair) <">; Regular qtext or
                                      ;   quoted chars.
     quoted-pair =  "\" CHAR                     ; may quote any char
     CHAR        =  <any ASCII character>        ; (  0-177,  0.-127.)

So this grammar does allows CR and LF inside quoted strings. The
question then is whether they're only alowed as part of folded lines
(what we want) or actually as part of the string itself, and the answer
is that it's the former...

        Each header field can be viewed as a single, logical  line  of
        ASCII  characters,  comprising  a field-name and a field-body.
        For convenience, the field-body  portion  of  this  conceptual
        entity  can be split into a multiple-line representation; this
        is called "folding".  The general rule is that wherever  there
        may  be  linear-white-space  (NOT  simply  LWSP-chars), a CRLF
        immediately followed by AT LEAST one LWSP-char may instead  be
        inserted.  Thus, the single line

            To:  "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @Org>, JJV @ BBN

        can be represented as: [...]
	
            To:  "Joe &
             J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>, JJV @ BBN

I don't think this would have been clear from the grammer alone, and so
I guess that's why we're having this dicussion. Maybe it's been
clarified for email in more recent RFC's. Anyway, given these semantics
for email I think it's most reasonable to interpret 2543 the same way.
No modifications needed, really.

Yes, fine by me.  I'll assume since nobody else stepped up to the plate 
that I've got the token on the I-D.

Content-Type: text/plain;

I had a question about using a HTTP URL as one of the parameters in a
SIP URL.
The parameter of interest is other-param whose syntax is defined as
(from 2543bis)
other-param =3D pname["=3D" pvalue ]
where pvalue =3D param-unreserved | unreserved |escaped
where param-unreserved =3D "["|"]"|"/"|":"|+|"$"
unreserved =3D alpahnum|mark
Let's say we have a HTTP URL
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt?number=3D2396
Does "?" need to be escaped since it isn't mentioned in either
unreserved or param-unreserved.
But if it is, "?" is a reserved character in HTTP URLs and this can
change the meaning of the URL.
OR the other option is to include the complete URL in quotes.=20
What would be the correct syntax for this?

thanks
vishwa

Just to add my two pence...

I found line folding and the comma separation a bit of a pain when doing our
SIP implementation.

I feel that if someone does a quick and dirty implementation of SIP, then
this is something they may either forget or just leave out.

As one of the attractions of SIP is its simplicity (at least the appearance
of such!), then I feel such quick and dirty jobs may appear in a number of
places.  This would lead to interoperability problems.

Therefore I think it would be reasonable for the spec to strongly suggest
that messages generated by a UA should not use line folding and comma
separation.  I think such advice would remove a whole bunch of potential
interoperability problems between industrial strength implementations and
quick jobs you might knock up in Perl or something to give you some neat
feature.

However, I agree that if you want to be industrial strength then you have no
choice but to cope with line-folding and comma separation for ever more.

Pete.

I'd like to re-interate what Jonathan said in a previous email on this
thread (see below) that there is already a fair amount of SIP out there
already so this discussion might be coming too late.  The last thing we need
are interoperability issues with SIP implementations that are coming out at
different times.

Just to add my two pence...

I found line folding and the comma separation a bit of a pain when doing our
SIP implementation.

I feel that if someone does a quick and dirty implementation of SIP, then
this is something they may either forget or just leave out.

As one of the attractions of SIP is its simplicity (at least the appearance
of such!), then I feel such quick and dirty jobs may appear in a number of
places.  This would lead to interoperability problems.

Therefore I think it would be reasonable for the spec to strongly suggest
that messages generated by a UA should not use line folding and comma
separation.  I think such advice would remove a whole bunch of potential
interoperability problems between industrial strength implementations and
quick jobs you might knock up in Perl or something to give you some neat
feature.

However, I agree that if you want to be industrial strength then you have no
choice but to cope with line-folding and comma separation for ever more.

Pete.

I agree - 183 seems to work, and many PSTN Gateway vendors area  long
way down this road.

Since the 183 I-D has expired, I wonder what replaces the Session header
that was proposed in that draft.  I think it is critical for a UAC to be
able to distinguish between SDP which is optional, and may safely ignore
(such as a customized ringtone or other feature) and early media which
can contain information about the final status of the call (ring no
answer, busytone, recorded announcement "The number you have dialed has
changed.  The new number is ...") that might be received from the PSTN.

Is it the consensus that SDP in a 180 response falls into the first
category - the UAC has the option of playing or not playing to the user,
and SDP in a 183 falls into the second category of "ignore at your
peril"?

As for Jonathan's options, I vote for 1.

<p>As for Jonathan's options, I vote for 1.

<br>I would strongly debate against changing the existing semantics of

<br>semantics of 183 . The 183 draft is clear on what needs to be done
with
<br>the response and what does an SDP mean in 183.
<p>The original concept of 180 (with or without SDP) and 183 (with SDP
always)
<br>works fine for all the scenarios today.
<p>For a UAS willing to feed any ringback /early media or announcements,
the choice of
<br>183 with SDP is there.
<br>These messages were thought about carefully and they mapped to ALERTING
and

a generic
<br>200 OK (As suggested in option 3) for all events then using SIP headers
to decide
<br>what to do might be an overkill.
<br>Think about the SIP drafts which are already under review based on
this logic.
<p>I still have concerns about :
<br>1) Why a need to distinguish a remote ringback case from a remote media
?
<br>2) If&nbsp; the caller wishes to change the media before the call is
established,
<br>the option 2 of sending re-INVITE is the most logical way to do.
<br>Agreed, that it is a pain; but so is everything down the lane when
QoS/PRACK/COMET/
<br>3pcc/ INVITE with DELAYED media et a.

<p>> These are the kind of anomalies that are to be expected when nested
<br>> calls are introduced. I believe when we had this discussion last

that

<p>I agree that option 2 adds too much complexity to SIP.
<p>However I think that early media is very useful for ip-telephony;
<br>thus I would hate to see option 3 get adopted.&nbsp; I just feel that
<br>early media needs to be more explicitly defined;
<br>please see "Remote ringback" thread.
<p>I think that if the caller needs to change SDP,
<br>the caller needs to wait until after the call is
<br>answered before sending a message with the new SDP.
<p>Unless considered a violation by the Transfer draft,
<br>the following is an overkill strange possibility.
<br>The caller can REFER the called party back to caller and
<br>provide the new SDP in the 200rsp, and CANCEL the
<br>original INVITE before the called party answers.&nbsp; When
<br>the original called party answers, the SDP is passed in
<br>the ACK.

I agree to Steve's point that QoS aware SIP UAs would have to take the option
(1)
because of so much interworking already based on the current logic.
For QoS unaware UAs, the option (2 or 3) which are messy are do-able.

I feel that 'media-aware SIP UAs ' are already burdened
with handling  complexities in implementing the following :
3pcc, early media, Reliable Prov responses, Manyfolks draft
which are all media related features. Any tweaks in basic call flows at this
point
either suggests that we moved too much ahead too fast or that we are
now stretching it too far.

It is quite natural that softswitch/proxy server/'media unaware UA"
implementors
are not seeing the above load .

thanks

&nbsp;
<br>I agree to Steve's point that QoS aware SIP&nbsp;UAs would have to
take the option (1)
<br>because of so much interworking already based on the current logic.
<br>For QoS unaware UAs, the option (2 or 3) which are messy are do-able.
<p>I feel that 'media-aware SIP UAs ' are already burdened
<br>with handling&nbsp; complexities in implementing the following :
<br>3pcc, early media, Reliable Prov responses, Manyfolks draft
<br>which are all media related features. Any tweaks in basic call flows
at this point
<br>either suggests that we moved too much ahead too fast or that we are
<br>now stretching it too far.
<p>It is quite natural that softswitch/proxy server/'media unaware UA"&nbsp;
implementors
<br>are not seeing the above load .
<p>thanks
<br>-manoj
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>It is an interworking issue that has billing implications,
not a billing
<br>issue.&nbsp; I will not go into it here, as it has been documented
already.
<p>I am certainly willing to explore other methods for solving this
<br>interworking issue.&nbsp; However, I would suspect that there are a
number of
<br>implementations out there that have implemented early media with 183.
<br>Please also remember that there were a number of proposals discussed
on the
<br>list for other creative uses of the early media concept.
<p>I have also seen it proposed in this and other threads that the ability
to
<br>attach SDP to a provisional response should be removed from the bis
draft.
<br>Doing so would break the QoS and security solutions documented in:
<p><a href="http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-01.txt">http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-manyfolks-sip-resource-01.txt</a>
<p>I suspect that the same issue raised about early media also applies
to the
<br>use of SDP in a 18x message for the purpose of setting up QoS and security
<br>relationships.
<p>It may not be the cleanest solution, but I vote for number 1 and making
it a
<br>client problem to handle changing of the IP address during session
setup.

Pete,

Gee, it's so difficult to handle line folding in Perl!
It takes a whole line!  And gee: that space before the
colon on the headers takes three characters of Perl!
Those case-insensitive comparisons are soooo difficult!

Don't be ridiculous: these aspects of parsing could be
coded on an MC6800 chip in assembler in less than an hour!

    $msg = <>;
    ($header, $body) = split(/\r?\n\r?\n/,$msg,2);
    ($start, $header) = split(/\r?\n/,$header,2);
    $header =~ s/\r?\n\s+/ /g; # handle line folding
    @headers = split(/(?:^|\r?\n)(\S+?)\s*:\s*/s,$header);
    shift @headers;
    %headers = ( @headers );
    foreach $k ( keys %headers ) {
        print $k.': '.$headers{$k}
    }

An hour - I could do it on a diode in 2 seconds...  And where's your
handling of comma separation!!!

Perl is good at this sort of thing.  That's probably why I use it to hack
things together.  Hence why I mentioned Perl when hacking.

But there are other languages that people hack around with that are not
quite as good as Perl for this sort of exercise.  Why make interoperability
problems if they can easily be avoided by generating easier code to parse in
the first place.  If anything, its the polite thing to do and it doesn't
really cost you anything.

BTW - You could write a bit of Perl to find where I mentioned something
about spaces before colons if you like!!

I deeply feel that the syntax description is archaic, we should probably
write them in perl's regex format, which should help
parsing tremendously.

     Just want to add to what you said, Perl's regex package stems from
Henry
Spencer's v8 regex package written in C.  If you don't like that package,
you
can also look at the perl's source code for regex packages.

     Even implementing perl's parsing features needed for SIP in C from
scratch
is also doable, the trick is to only implement what is needed, not any more.

     So parsing SIP can be done is C, perl, Java, not mentioning assembly.

<br>> (not yet anyway).
<br>>
<br>> We feel that SIP today is unnecessary complex which costs time
<br>> during development and testing of a SIP parser. It also cost
<br>> execution time which we can see no reason for. Maybe there are
<br>> historic reasons why SIP is specified as it is but since the
<br>> specification does not explain this (which it shouldn't) we
<br>> can't see the reason for certain constructions. We understand
<br>> that HTTP has been a great influence when specifying SIP but
<br>> we have not heard any explanation why.
<br>>
<br>> In general we think SIP allows too many optional ways of doing things.
<br>> Each of these options cost development time, testing time and
<br>> execution time in every SIP enabled product. And since some SIP
<br>> UA most likely is small devices with limited processor power, memory
<br>> size etc. it must be interesting to reduce the amount of code
<br>> needed to parse the SIP messages.
<br>> Every option also adds the possibility of introducing bugs which
<br>> we noticed during the last bakeoff. So by making SIP more
<br>> simple we think it will be easier to develop SIP enabled products
<br>> with better quality in shorter time. This would at the end help
<br>> spreading SIP even faster than today which we hope everyone is
<br>> interested in doing (at least in this mail group).
<br>>
<br>> So what we basically suggest is that only the canonical representation
<br>> should be used. All other formats should be depricated in the same
<br>> way as the different ways of terminating the SIP-headers was depricated
<br>> some time ago. In this way SIP will still be backwards-compatible
<br>> since everyone has to be able to receive the canonical representation.
<br>> It will just take some time for everyone to adapt their code so
<br>> they only send out the canonical representation. After a while it's
<br>> possible to make a new version of SIP that only allows the canonical
<br>> form. Then it's up to everyone to decide if they want to support
<br>> both SIP 2.0 as well as the new version or only the new version.
<br>>
<br>> According to the SIP specification (chapter 13.2 in rfc2543bis-01)
<br>> the canonical representation restricts the SIP syntax in this way
:
<br>>
<br>> * No short form header fields;
<br>> * Header field names are capitalized as shown in the rfc;
<br>> * No white space between the header name and the colon;
<br>> * A single space after the colon;
<br>> * Line termination with a CRLF;
<br>> * No line folding;
<br>> * No comma separated lists of header values; each must appear as
a
<br>> separate header;
<br>> * Only a single SP between tokens, between tokens and quoted strings,
<br>> and between quoted strings; no SP after last token or quoted string;
<br>> * No LWS between tokens and separators, except as described above
for
<br>> after the colon in header fields;
<br>> * The To and From header fields always include the &lt; and > delimiters
<br>> even if the display-name is empty.
<br>>
<br>> We can't see any problem in any of these restrictions. Some of them
<br>> only restricts how many white space characters you are allowed to
use
<br>> so those restrictions can't be any problem to introduce. Why send
extra
<br>> spaces that only adds unnecessary bytes to the messages ?
<br>>
<br>> To disallow the compact form of the headers might be a problem but
<br>> since using the compact form only saves about 70-80 bytes a UA still
<br>> have to be able to handle the case where the message don't fit in
<br>> one MTU. If this is a real problem why not define a compact form
<br>> for _all_ headers in SIP and only use that form ?
<br>>
<br>> To capitalize the header field names exactly as they are specified
<br>> in the RFC does not seem to be a problem either. Why should it be
<br>> possible to write e.g. Content-Length as cOnTeNt-lEnGtH ?
<br>>
<br>> Line folding is also something we can't see any reason for. Since
<br>> all UA/Servers have to be able to _receive_ any length of a header
<br>> line why can't they _send_ every header in one line ?
<br>>
<br>> To allow a comma separated list in the Via and Record-Route etc.
<br>> is one of the optional things that seems unnecessary. Especially
<br>> since it creates longer lines which means you might need line folding.
<br>> Since all UA that intend to handle Authentication have to use the
<br>> canonical representation anyway why not always use it ?
<br>>
<br>> We realize that it's a little bit late in the SIP development to
<br>> make changes in the protocol but we feel that these changes are
<br>> not very big since it's already specified in the RFC.
<br>>
<br>> If everyone is happy with todays specification we can live with
<br>> it too since we have already implemented it. But we feel that it
<br>> would help SIP to spread faster in the future by making it as
<br>> simple as possible to parse.
<br>>
<br>> So what do you think. Is this proposal something you think
<br>> is worth introducing or is it better to keep things as it is ?

There is a SOCKS website at http://www.socks.nec.com/. It also includes
reference software. However, I doubt it will help you very much -- SOCKSv5
does not allow SOCKS client to bind to and learn a public address/port.
I.e., it will not be able to form a SIP invitation.

Well, thanks, but I didn't propose this header, Marc did.

In any case, seems like the consensus here is to punt this, and stick
with what we have re 183 and SDP in provisionals.

Hi,

Well... Installed base syndrom bites again...

With consensual 183, an ad-hoc solution is to switch the Early Media, this 
is better than switching all the media for the call and worse than 
switching no media at all.

I.E: To change the destination of the early media of an ougoing call before 
the call is connected, the caller has to instruct the receiver of the media 
to retransmit it to the new destination. When the call is connected, caller 
will send a re-INVITE to have the media directed to the rigth destination 
directly by the callee.

What should be the name for such a switching function ? "RTP Proxy", "RTP 
Switcher", "ISWF, Integrated Switching Fabric" ?

Nota: This is an ad-hoc solution for an hypotetical cheap decomposed 
wireless IP phone.

Nota: This does not solve the "hold" case. I.E. there is no way to stop the 
early media from flowing.

Conclusion: 183 results in "During call setup, Callee is stronger than 
Caller because only Callee can change SDP for Early Media, workaround is to 
switch the Early Media". Is there a place (some draft) to store this 
solution for a PSTN interoperability related issue ?

Yours,

Jean-Hugues Robert

   If you want decomposed, use MGCP/MEGACO.

   I've been hearing some rumblings in wireless
   about hacking on SIP to make way for a "dumbed
   down" phone. As, in trying to offload some of
   the call processing and who knows what else off
   the "dumb" phone. Maybe somebody else has a
   clear definition of what that might be, but I'm
   extremely suspicious that:

   1) A "dumbed down" phone will not in fact be any
      dumber given the things it must do which
      have nothing to do with SIP, per se.

   2) That Moore's Law hasn't already made
      need for gobs of extra complexity moot. Ram
      and flash are about $2/MB retail. 

   There are some clear disadvantages of trying to
   use some UA-like proxy though: namely garden
   walls, end to end transparency, and far worse,
   privacy/security. In order to justify this sort
   of architecture, the cost savings would need to
   be at least an order of magnitude down on a
   cost item that actually impacts the COG's
   significantly. This ain't one of them, IMO.

		       Mike

   This is if you make the assumption that you can't
   use IP mobility instead which solves the general
   problem. I've seen some pretty promising work on
   that front which looks like it converges very, very
   fast. Application layer routing should be the last
   option, not the first in my opinion.

Hi,

"Switching early media solves the cheap decomposed wireless IP phone case"

At 09:02 AM 8/19/00 -0700, Michael Thomas wrote:

Sure. In the cheap wireless IP phone case, MGCP could be used to have the 
"full featured java based SIP UA with a fancy user application" tell the 
dump writeless phone were to send media. However this does not solve the 
early media issue. When wireless IP phone IP address is changed, early 
media need to be delivered to the new IP address, not the old one. That is 
were a RTP Switcher is needed.

Good points. Fact is, there is no such thing as a cheap IP phone, wireless 
or not... yet.

What is "COG" ?

OK, let me try again,

I understand that all the design and implementations made for the 18x
cannot simply be thrown. But I think that the idea of having the
alerting after the establishement of the session is interesting, and
even can be extended. 
My previous mail described the X-Media header just as an information
header, just to know when starting the billing. We can replace it by
another header:

Call-State = "X-Call-State" ":" call-state
call-state = "Idle" | "Offered" | "Queued" | "Alerting" | "Talking" |
"Held" | "Failed" | "Disconnected"

In this scenario, this header is mandatory (with a Require header) and
all the provisonnal responses except the 100 are forbidden. Now each SIP
Agent is a state machine and each request or response contains the state
of the machine that send the message.

We can imagine a SIP gateway in the "grey" zone between Internet and the
PSTN who can work like this:

Internet             Gateway               PSTN
   |  INVITE Idle       |                   |
   |------------------->|      INVITE       |
   |  100 Idle          |------------------>|
   |<-------------------|      100          |
   |  200 Offered       |<------------------|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |  ACK Talking       |                   |
   |------------------->|                   |
   |                    |                   |
   |                    |      18x          |
   |  INVITE Alerting   |<------------------|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |  OK Talking        |                   |
   |------------------->|      PRACK        |
   |  ACK Alerting      |------------------>|
   |<-------------------|      200 PRACK    |
   |                    |<------------------|
   |                    |                   |
   |                    |                   |
   |                    |      200          |
   |  INVITE Talking    |<------------------|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |  OK Talking        |                   |
   |------------------->|      ACK          |
   |  ACK Talking       |------------------>|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |                    |                   |

Now we can put an alerting session on hold. The RTP packets from the
PSTN side are discarded by the RTP translator in the Gateway, just like
in (1)

Internet             Gateway               PSTN

   |                    |                   |

The discussion in the SIP mailing-list is now about the media in the
pre-connect stages (alerting, progress...), but in the future the media
stream can also be of some interest when the connection failed (i.e.
instead of a 486 Busy or a 603 Decline, I want to play a prerecorded
message - for a specific person for example). This is not relevant for
PSTN sessions but the message can be generated by the gateway:

Internet             Gateway               PSTN
   |  INVITE Idle       |                   |
   |------------------->|      INVITE       |

   |  200 Offered       |<------------------|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |  ACK Talking       |                   |
   |------------------->|                   |
   |                    |                   |
   |                    |      603          |
   |  INVITE Failed     |<------------------|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |  OK Talking        |                   |
   |------------------->|      ACK          |
   |  ACK Failed        |------------------>|
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |                    |                   |
   |  BYE Disconnected  |                   |
   |------------------->|                   |
   |  OK Disconnected   |                   |
   |<-------------------|                   |
   |                    |                   |

With this design, we have three layers
- The first layer for searching the destination and establishing a link
(Activated between the first INVITE and the BYE). The Session-Expires
mechanism can be part of this layer.
- The second layer for the call control (state machines)
- The third layer for the media (SDP exchange)

In fact, "this proposition versus the early media" sounds like "JTAPI
versus JAIN".

Can you provide an example and the benefits gained by perl's regular
expression format? Also, how will the folks who have parsers in 'C' and
Java be able to benefit from this format?

Agree totally.
I would think its too late now to have something like a "simply simpler
SIP"  right now.
The base draft does make some demands on the implementor trying to be
"fully" compliant to the ABNF.
I do not think that this is really an issue of it being so easy with Perl,
or whatever.
The simplicity or lack of it in  a protocol should not be decided just
because it takes 10 lines in Perl.

The fact is that there is a degree of irritant/baggage like Jonathan
mentioned - but its too late to do away  with them.

Those implementations that don't want to handle all these possibilites,
don't. Return an error or something. As it is, how
often do you see other products sending line-folded, evil-quoted, crazy
LWS, etc message ? The percentage would be
low. If you want to not support them. you would still be supporting most
cases (or so I believe). Most of the leniency
attributes of SIP are to do with "torture scenarios" and typically dont
occur. Those that may occurs are very simple to
do (even in C) (example extra LWSses around)


I do agree however, that if you are in the business of selling SIP
products, you would have to make it as "industry-stable"
as possible - which would therefore include these scenarios. The process of
re-invention could be endless - something
can always be bettered - but after a while, its
investment/time/compatibility vs leanness.

Subject:  Re: [SIP] Simplify SIP




If I had it over again, I would eliminate line folding, case
insensitivity, and a host of other things. But, when the spec was begun,
it was decided that rather than inventing new syntax, we would borrow
from a clearly successful, highly interoperable, well understood
protocol for which a whole lot of code was available. That meant we
inherited the good along with the bad.

Because we must be backwards compatible with rfc2543, there is no choice
but to insist implementations handle line folding and other things (in
reality its not so bad once you construct a tokenizer than knows about
line folding. In this way, it is handled once. My old C code for this
was on the order of 50 lines). We could have rfc2543bis insist on
sending in some canonical form, but it won't help parsers which must
anyway handle the various forms. I suppose eventually those could be
phased out, but there is a fair amount of SIP out there already, so I
don't know that non-canonical form would be gone that soon.

To elaborate on "tie" - in the current version of the draft, REFERs
have to take place in the context of a session initiatied with an
INVITE. I had several people at the bakeoff argue that this is an
an unneccesary restriction (and I agree). The current plan is to
remove it.

I assume you meant transferee everywhere you used transferor in
this paragraph.

In draft-sparks-sip-cc-transfer-00, the call-ID from the TRANSFER
(now REFER) was copied into the resulting INVITE. That behavior
was removed from this draft in favor of allowing the transferor to
suggest a call-id to use through the use of headers in the Refer-To:
URL (see the ABNF for SIP-URL). If the transferor (who, in this scenario,
wishes to protect the transfer target) wishes to allow the the transferee
to correlate the invites, it could include the original call-id in the
Refer-To: URL.

Hi,
            IP mobility solution would probably work fine for intra-domain case
with fast hand-off mechanism, some of which have been  proposed recently. But
for Interdomain case we still need a better solution than just plain  IP
mobility approach for reducing the loss (if we care about it) when the IP
address changes on the wireless handset. We may have a need to adopt a hybrid
approach in that case.

Thanks
Ashutosh

   This is if you make the assumption that you can't
   use IP mobility instead which solves the general
   problem. I've seen some pretty promising work on
   that front which looks like it converges very, very
   fast. Application layer routing should be the last
   option, not the first in my opinion.

   Sorry, cost of goods.

May I suggest that any proposals that mention simplification that is not
backward-compatible have the burden of proof showing that

- the collective effort spent discussing is less than the collective
effort coding them?

- substantially increases overall call processing speed (not just
parsing speed), where substantially is at least a few months of Moore's
law processor speed-ups?

It's clearly a good idea to send in canonical form (and already
encouraged for various encryption/authentication-using requests), but
the old "be liberal in what you accept" policy has advantages. After
all, these same rules on spacing and line folding have not exactly kept
email and HTTP from becoming popular or from scaling to very large
message volumes.

My guess would be that for a C/assembly-based optimized parser, extra
spaces have essentially no dynamic cost and modest static cost in table
space for the state transitions. Line folding probably has a
one-if-statement/line cost. (The major cost of additional spaces will be
copy costs, but those are only incurred by non-canonical senders. I
expect high-volume senders to be canonic senders, just as for email.)

Hi,

  What about a RTCP ? Shouldn't the terminals sending the media on
send-only/recv-only streams pass a non-zero port on which they can receive
RTCP traffic ?

Meir.

Am I reading this wrong? Surely any 18x with SDP from B to A means that B
will be sending one-way audio and A cannot send audio to B???

I would disagree with this for a few reasons:
1. In the case of PSTN interoperability, once the remote end starts sending
one-way audio, the remote end has to continue sending one-way audio until
the call is either answered or disconnected. (E.g., in ISDN, a PROGRESS with
no indicator for cut-through audio doesn't mean the far end has stopped
sending cut-through audio.)
2. Certainly in the case of 183, there may be attachments other than an SDP
attachment, so receiving no SDP should not mean "stop receiving audio", and
it would not be good if the interpretation of attachments were different for
180 than for 183.
3. Unless PRACKs are being used, A doesn't know whether the 180's have been
received out of order. (Which isn't really much of an objection, given that
B may send a new 180 with a different codec, but still, B should be required
to explicitly state that there is no more audio; see next point.)
4. In an INVITE, the absence of an SDP attachment doesn't mean "create a
session with no media". So if B wants to stop sending cut-through audio, it
should send a 180 with an SDP attachment without an "m=" line. Then the SDP
attachments in the 180 and the INVITE would work the same way. (And it would
still be possible for B to tell A to start providing local ringback, despite
the rather weak first point.)

Agree.

Meir,

Last I checked the RTCP had to be one greater than the RTP port to which it
corresponded.

Not necessarily; RFC 2793 allows to send whole blocks of text, so a
"line mode" could be supported either way.

   Why would you ever want to change the home IP
   address at all? If you believe in mobility,
   then you obtain new COA's and the problem
   reduces to a (solvable) AAA problem.

This assumes, of course, that you can get a generally accessible IP
address where you can install a HA. If you're behind a firewall at
"home" and don't have the support of the local sysadmin, this is
non-trivial. The lack of deployment of mobile IPv4 seems to attest to
this difficulty.

   This assumes that the HA is always at "home".

   Also: I'm not sure how you're naming your UA
   behind the NAT/firewall without the help of
   some sysadmin type person.

No, but it has to be somewhere where the network is willing to give me a
permanent IP address. I'm not aware of such a service, although it would
be quite useful.

Not really. I can imagine using a permanent address of the
hotmail/yahoo/etc. variety without any sysadmin help and without fees.
There is no shortage of user or domain names. I could run such a service
on my DSL line at home, with one IP address.

For every problem there is an equal and opposite

I personally think there is a good deal of
motivation for wireless things to not have their
HA on the same subnet as their real home
subnet. The main reason is that a dog-leg through
a comparatively slow access (cable, DSL, etc) that
almost certainly wants you to pay for QoS bits
doesn't sound like a very ideal situation to
me. It would be a lot cleaner to put the HA in the
middle of a diffserv cloud and be done with it.

   It's hard to determine who is being more obtuse
   here, but it appears to me that we've come full
   circle to there not being any reason to change
   your home IP addresses when roaming.

I agree if B uses 0.0.0.0 as a connection address.  However if B uses a
valid
connection address, I have not explicitly seen in rfc2543 how A should
handle
it.  I think that there is a potential concerning a 182 for A to pass inband
DTMF
to move up in the queue.

I also foresee the same sort of DTMF possibility concerning a 181.  It could
be
used concerning calling-verses-forwarding billing acceptance, to pick a
forwarding
location, or to allow an attempt to bypass the forwarding.

I also foresee using the same sort of DTMF possibilities with a 183.  The
user could
select various options relating to the "special announcement".

I agree that the thought of two way media being established before 200/ACK
seems strange.  But I think that one way media is just as strange though
useful
from a PSTN perspective.

It does if the proxy CANCEL B that provided remote media, and proxy INVITE C
which does not provide remote media.

I completely agree the PRACKs are the means to help ensure order.  However
if PRACK is not used, only reception order or Date can be used.

This is one way to do it; I'm not sure if it is the best way.  However my
main
point is to hopefully get rfc2543 to clearly state what 18x means when used
in a variety of test flows.  I think that a 180 without SDP could/should be
used for clarity from a normal 180 with/without SDP perspective.  However
if the working group wants to do some sort of media alignment, connection
address, media port means to resolve the issue,  I won't protest.

Just seeking clarity and resolution.

Or better use dynamic home agent as often proposed and dynamic DNS ( as
described in HMMP and a recent host mobility paper in Mobicom 2000) may help if
the home agent is still in the home subnet, but still do not know how reverse
lookup for A record in different domain with different SOA would work for a
foreign IP address in that case.

Thanks

I think that's the point -- if you're sending '0' as your port number, does that
mean that your RTCP port is port 1 ??  I suppose you could do that once, but man
is that going to screw around with RFC 1078.  In send-only mode, you still
expect RTCP Receiver-Reports from the receiver, and in receive-only mode, you
still send them back.

When the 183 draft was folded into the rfc2543, I thought that
the SDP's presence in 181, 182 was to roughly mean
the same thing as an SDP in 180 or 183.  I am hoping to get
rfc2543 to clearly state what receiving a 18x with an SDP
specifically means.

In addition, does a connection address of not being 0.0.0.0
in a 183 SDP mean that the SDP sender is currently listening
for any dtmf, voice, etc?  Previous emails in this thread mention
possible uses.

I agree, and I am hoping to get this explicitly stated in rfc2543.

I agree, and I am hoping to get this explicitly stated in rfc2543.

I am just hoping for a suggested policy from a called/calling party
perspective.  If A does not intend to actually listen as a result of the
18x, should something indicate this as a result of guaranteed
provisional delivery.  ( I guess that some of this belongs in the
guaranteed provisional delivery draft. )

For basic SIP, I completely agree for simplicity reasons.  However
an extension could be possible to address this situation.  If
the REFER method can't be used, I assume someone might
propose a another extension.

Can you summarize for my benefit? I'm worried about anything that
*relies* on such a feature, as it is not likely to be interoperable and
has potential security implications. (I wouldn't want my microphone to
be active before the call is connected...)

I completely agree with your concerns about voice being passed 
from calling party prior to 200/ACK; this is especially true for a 180.
However I think that inband DTMF should be possible when a 18x
has been passed containing a complete SDP with connection
address not being 0.0.0.0. 

I think that there is a potential concerning a 182 for A to pass inband
DTMF to move up in the queue.

I also foresee the same sort of DTMF possibility concerning a 181.  
It could be used concerning calling-verses-forwarding billing 
acceptance, to pick a forwarding location, or to allow an attempt 
to bypass the forwarding.

I also foresee using the same sort of DTMF possibilities with a 183.  
The user could select various options relating to the "special 
announcement".  The user could respond to a request to press "1",
as a means to inform the called that the caller wants setup to
continue to be tried.  The user could be requested to enter a 
location for a call-back when the called party actually answers.

I agree that the thought of two way media being established before 
200/ACK seems strange.  But I think that one way media is just as 
strange though useful from a PSTN perspective.

I don't think that there will be any backwards compatibility problems
since any services attempting such a thing would have to be
structured to know that PSTN or other protocol limitations might
restrict passing DTMF from occurring.  Also, many gateways and
networks will limit the length time in non-billable call setup.  Also,
the delivery of 18x might not always be guaranteed or played for
caller.

As always, just looking for clarity, simplicity, and cool new features.

hello all,
   just a general query that has come up. I have got to know that many 
organizations who have a big LAN(i.e. consisting of various subnets attached 
with routers), allow only unicast  enabled routers to exist in their LAN, 
because of the premonition of excess network traffic etc... In this scenario 
how can i do conferencing (using multicasting and not MCU).Can i do 
something at the SIP stack level(i.e. software level) or i need to ask the 
network adm. to enable multicast packets also to pass through routers. Would 
something like Mbone work inside the LAN(i'm not sure!!!). Please give some 
insight into the above situation.
        Thanking you all,
           rahul.

You can run tunnels.

Neither. SIP has nothing whatsoever to do with this. Running tunnels to
an mbone router requires only that your admin pass IP in IP, which I
would guess will work fine.

If it runs IP, it can be carrier pidgeon
(http://www.normos.org/ietf/rfc/rfc1149.txt), LAN, whatever.

Robert,

Thank you for developing
draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-00.

Here are some comments/questions.

Brett Tate
BroadSoft

---------------------------

General comments:

1- please specify how receiving BYE effects an=20
 outstanding REFER.  I assume that it doesn't
 cancel the REFER.  Should a REFER final
 response of 200 be sent to immediately close the=20
 transaction?  Should a new final response
 be defined to indicate the transaction is still
 being processed, but I will be unable to provide
 an accurate response since the call-leg is
 disappearing.

2- please specify if two REFERs can be outstanding
 on a call-leg at the same time.

3- please specify if the call state has to reach
 a specific state before the REFER can be triggered.
 I was glad to hear that REFER may not have to be
 part of an existing session, but can it also be=20
 valid during call-setup to hopefully address=20
 location, SDP changes, or transfer during ringing?

4- please address any media mixing/switching=20
 requirements as a result of the transferor=20
 session still being present.  Can a header=20
 or parameter be used to better clarify the=20
 REFER request from the transferor point of view?

5- please address how a RE-INVITE from the transferor
 effects a successful REFER transaction.

6- please specify that a CANCEL of REFER should=20
 trigger a 487 for the REFER.

7- please address how a second REFER from transferor
 effects a successful first REFER from transferor.

8- What provisional response should be sent by the
 transferee to indicate the REFER was received
 and is being processed?  The 100 cannot be used
 since proxies can also send it.  =20



Section 5.3:

The Content-Length header statement about being
present with value of 0 conflicts with section
5.4 concerning a body being present.  Removing the
"and have a value of zero" should fix the conflict.


Section 6.2.1 flow:

Can a new method/header/parameter be defined
to indicate to the Transfer target that an INVITE=20
from new call-leg is about to occur which will=20
contain a particular Referred-By.  And when=20
received, please handle it based upon the=20
Request-Disposition.  This would
be useful so the transferor can switch out of a
call without the transfer target having to hang up
the phone or have call waiting.  This comment is
also useful for 6.2.2, 6.3, and 6.4.

New method: PENDING-INVITE
New header: Request-Disposition =3D=20
  "Request-Disposition" ":" "=3D"=20
 "switch-bye" | "mix" | "reject" | "hold-me" | token

"switch-bye" means quit listening to me and
send a BYE for our session upon receiving the
INVITE.

"mix" means to please mix the media.

"reject" means the REFER was cancelled, and
thus the INVITE should be rejected.

"hold-me" means quit streaming to me until
I send a RE-INVITE.

The PENDING-INVITE would contain the usual=20
headers plus Request-Disposition, Referred-By,
Expires, and Date.

The transfer target would compare the Referred-By's
received in the INVITE and PENDING-INVITE.  If equal,
the Request-Disposition is honored.  Otherwise,
the INVITE is received and process as if the=20
PENDING-INVITE was not received.
=20
The Request-Disposition header could also be used
in a REFER to indicate how the sending wishes the
receiving to handle the REFER concerning the session
and media.  Of course the "reject" does not
make sense in a REFER.  The Request-Disposition=20
would addresses general comment number 4.

[The above is just an idea to see if something like
this is needed or even belongs in the transfer draft.]


Section 5.2.2 Variation 2...:=20

Should be labeled "6.2.2".

The actors of Transferee and Transfer Target seem reversed.

Please see comments on 6.2.1 as a means to avoid the=20
transferee from needing call waiting or a second line=20
for the switch to occur.  [ I assume that call-ID would not
be trusted for a quick switch or mix mechanism since=20
it does not get encrypted. ]

I have a query about the grammar for WWW-Authenticate header.

The grammar for WWW-Authenticate header in rfc 2543 (sec 6.42)
references rfc 2068 (sec 14.46) for the syntax.

According to rfc 2068, the grammar is
     WWW-Authenticate   = "WWW-Authenticate" ":" 1#challenge
     challenge          = auth-scheme 1*SP realm *( "," auth-param )
                                                     ^---- COMMA USED TO 
                                                     MARK PARAMS


But, rfc 2543 gives an example of WWW-Authenticate header grammar
when PGP is used (sec 15.1.1)

        WWW-Authenticate =  "WWW-Authenticate" ":" "pgp" pgp-challenge
        pgp-challenge    =  * (";" pgp-params ) 
                                ^---- SEMICOLON USED TO MARK PARAMS

        pgp-params       =  realm | pgp-version | pgp-algorithm | nonce


The grammars appear slightly different (notably, the use of the 
semi-colon to begin the parameters).

My doubt is: shouldn't the grammar for WWW-Authenticate-with-PGP be
derived from 2068's generic grammar. If so, how does one explain the
semi-colon?

I'm probably reading too much into this, but I would like to hear
any comments about it all the same.

Thanks.

Hi,

I'd like to revisit the thorny issue of Loop Detection and
Via-Hiding, if I may.

Imagine an INVITE issued by a User Agent, UA X, which is routed
through Proxy A to Proxy B, whereby Proxy B decides to send it
on to Proxy A.  At this point the INVITE has looped.  However,
Proxy A requested Via hiding, so does not detect the loop, and
forwards the request to Proxy B again.
  
    +------+         +---------+   1st   +---------+
    |      |         |         | ------> |         |   
    | UA X | ------> | Proxy A |         | Proxy B |
    |      |         |         | ------> |         |
    +------+         +---------+   2nd   +---------+
                          ^                   |     
                          |                   |     
                          |                   |     
                          +-------------------+      

I will call the request from UA X to Proxy A, X-A;
the "first" request from Proxy A to Proxy B, A-B;
the request from Proxy B to Proxy A, B-A;
and the "second", already-looped, request from Proxy A to Proxy B, A-B2.

As I understand it [1], it is supposed to be Proxy B that detects
the loop, by attempting to decrypt Vias.  I have big trouble with
this, because if Proxy A is stateful, then any ACK or CANCEL
generated by Proxy A will be ambiguous in that Proxy B will be
unable to determine if the ACK or CANCEL is for request A-B or
request A-B2.

Am I right about this?

Wouldn't it perhaps be better if proxies could detect loops even if
their Via had been hidden?  It seems to me that recommending that the
branch parameter is somehow uniquely identifiable to an instance of an
implementation would enable this; say by recommending that some
portion conforms to the requirements of the "tag" parameter.
Then detecting loops would just require a proxy to search for any
Vias that have branch parameters that look "familiar", and then
performing the usual computation (to avoid flagging spirals as loops).

Now comes my real dilemma. &:)

Say Proxy A isn't clever with branch parameters, and thus does add
another hop, A-B2, to an already-looped request.  Now Proxy B can
detect the loop.  However, if Proxy B is stateful, should it attempt
to detect the loop?  To Proxy B, this request A-B2 is going to look
like a retransmission of A-B based on the To, From, Call-ID, CSeq,
Request-URI, and topmost-Via...but there are other Vias present.

I guess what I'm asking is if a stateful proxy should be aggressive
in loop detection, by checking every single request it sees, or just
for "new" requests (i.e., when To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, Request-URI,
topmost-Via tuple match no others).

My gut feeling is that it should only check for "new" requests,
because dragons be elsewhere.  For instance, if Proxy B responds
with a 482, and Proxy A ACKs, then the ACK is not going to be
distinguishable; unless Proxy B puts some special tag in the To
header, I guess.

The real shame is that CANCELs are completely indistinguishable
(okay, save the case that Proxy A is stateless), which is just plain
unfair if Proxy B happened to fork to other places besides Proxy A.
(I would note that "aggressive" loop detection by Proxy B here would
help in that if it returns the 482 "quickly", it's less likely to
see a CANCEL for A-B2; i.e., if a CANCEL arrives, it's more likely
to be for A-B.)

One other point that springs to mind: if it were recommended that
branch parameters were unique, period, would that help to alleviate
this problem?  (I currently read 6.46.6 as requiring them just to
be unique within the space of one request.)

Thoughts?

Cheers,


 - Jo.

Short answer - no effect.

I think you are asking about the case where you
receive a REFER and then receive a BYE while you
are processing it. While allowing REFER to be sent
outside of a "session" makes this easier to think
about, the sending party could send them as part
of the same session. This isn't a problem for your
end - you finish the REFER transaction with a 
final response when you can. The other side may
be beyond doing anything useful with a non-200
response however.

That originating side should not be overlapping
the REFER and the BYE however. It should either
CANCEL the REFER before the BYE or wait to send
the BYE until the REFER final response comes in
(note that this doesn't imply it has to tie up
its user-interface during that time).

>

This would not be different from having REFERs
arrive concurrently for two different call legs.

Can you elaborate on what you are wanting to accomplish
here? You are wanting to change the address at which
you receive media after you send and INVITE but before
you receive a final response to it?

REFER has no effect at all on any existing session -
particularly those session's media.
>

Again, REFER (even as it is currently written) has no
afffect on the existing session - an overlapped reINVITE
would not interact with it. (I assume you are describing
something like putting the transferee on hold after
having sent the REFER?)

>

OK. Was there confusion on this? As I understand it,
CANCEL of _any_ cancellable method results in a
487 being returned for that method.

>

> effects a successful first REFER from transferor.

Those are independent events (even if they occur on
the same call leg).

Do we really need something for this? 100 lets us know
that it either got there or something in between has
taken responsibility for getting it there. As far as
the sender is concerned, it should now assume that
the request is being processed and a final response
will be forthcoming. I think you are asking for 
something back from the transferee that says
"I got this and I've started to do what it says",
which you can infer from the lack of a non-2xx final
response.

I've removed it - it was a holdover from the original
bodiless TRANSFER draft.

I would do this instead with header values in
the Refer-To: URI.

And from later in the document: 
 >Please see comments on 6.2.1 as a means to avoid the 
 >transferee from needing call waiting or a second line 
 >for the switch to occur.  [ I assume that call-ID would not

The signature in the Referred-By header should be used to 
give the referenced target the comfort you are looking
for here. It is intended to give the referenced party
proof of the identity of the original REFERer and 
integrity of the reference (i.e. the signature comes
from the party issuing the REFER) - so you can trust
any information you received in the headers in the
Refer-To: URI to do things like quick switch you
mention.

From a quick scan of the document this morning, its
not clear how that signature gets into the Refered-By
header however. I will correct that.
 
>Section 5.2.2 Variation 2...:

>Should be labeled "6.2.2".

Fixed

>The actors of Transferee and Transfer Target seem reversed.

They aren't, but I can see how the shell game with the names
is confusing. From a black box perspective, the Transferor
is going to do things to cause the Transferee to be connected
to the protected Transfer-Target. This flow shows how to do
this by actually transferring the transfer-target to the 
transferee.

I think I remember it being said that the slides from the 48th
IETF, 
based on the trawl through this list's archive for open issues,
were 
going to be made available somewhere. Is this still the plan as
I couldn't find them at the SIP WG Supplemental Home Page:-

Rahul:
Many large organizations that have enterprise networks comprising of several
LANs and routers typically are often not multicast enabled. To do multicasting,
certain subnets and their associated routers would have to run mrouted (or some
of the newer protocols PIM etc) so that multicast addressing can be understood
and forwarded. To be connected to the MBONE, it is also important to set up a
tunnel (IP-over-IP) to the nearest MBONE node so that intermediate routers can
still forward multicast packets.
Now related to your concerns about doing conferencing. If you run an MCU
somewhere (assuming SIP based), then it could still mix media traffic using
unicast streams and send the content to respective IP hosts who have joined a
session. However, if your network is multicast enabled, then of course you gain
efficiency using multicasting the content from the MCU. I am not sure if there
is anything special you have to do inside the SIP stack. But your application
should send packets to a multicast session address if multicasting is supported.

On the topic of one-way vs. two-way early media: Originally, I believe, the
183 response with a session description was proposed to provide PSTN
compatibility (to handle cut-through audio). If two-way early media is
allowed, doesn't that break PSTN compatibility? For example, suppose I am a
Q.931-to-SIP gateway. If I receive a 18x requesting a two-way media session,
what message do I send on the Q.931 side to set up the two-way media path
without connecting the call? In the interests of compatibility, would it not
be better to disallow early two-way media? If the callee needs to listen for
DTMF, it can always send a 200 OK.

On the question of how to stop early media that has already been started:
Again, suppose I am a Q.931-to-SIP gateway, this time carrying the Q.931
messages as SIP-T attachments. I receive a Progress message with Progress
Indicator 8 from the PSTN side (after having received an INVITE and sent a
Setup). The Prog. Ind. 8 means that cut-through audio is available, so I
send a 183 with a multi-part attachment containing an SDP part and a Q.931
part. Then I receive a Progress message with no information about
cut-through audio, but with some other progress information. I would like to
send a 183 with a Q.931 attachment, and I would not like the absence of an
SDP part to indicate the end of early media. True, I could always resend the
previous SDP part, but to me that requires a little more effort than not
having to duplicate the SDP. It would always be possible to terminate the
early media by sending an SDP that explicitly specifies no media.

One more point on early media: What about the handling of media attachments
in unrecognized 1xx responses (184 or whatever)? Would it not solve this
problem, and simplify SIP, to specify uniform handling of media attachments
on all 1xx responses? (Of course, the UAS could not add an attachment to a
non-end-to-end response, but the UAC wouldn't need to worry about that.)

In fact, isn't this another reason for _not_ having the absence of an SDP
attachment stop early media? The UAC could start/stop/modify an early media
stream based on the sequence of attachments received on all 1xx responses
(whether the response codes are known to the UAC or not). The receipt of a
message without an attachment would not mean stop the media, it would just
mean that the particular response was not relevant to early media. The UAC
could handle the responses and SDP attachments completely separately
(providing separation of media and signaling). For example: (1) a 1xx is
received with SDP, and the UAC starts receiving early media; (2) a 1xx with
no attachment is then received, and the UAC processes the response, but
media are not affected; (3) a 1xx is received with an SDP specifying no
media, so the UAC stops receiving early media. (It is true that semantically
a 180 is different from a 183 and a UAC could ignore the SDP on a 180 with
less detriment to the end user than in the case of a 183, but ignoring a
media attachment would hardly be the preferred behavior; the idea is that a
UAC could _choose_ to treat the SDP attachments as a set of messages
completely independent from the responses proper.)

Sure.

 By using regex in Perl format, people will, first of all, be forced to
understand Perl's regex. Then they will discover their
old ways of parsing SIP is a total waste of time, and finally, become a
smart programmer.

Any questions, let me know.

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-drums-smtpupd-12.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-drums-msg-fmt-08.txt

are probably the most recent relevant documents here. If somebody can
apply their text interpretation skills here and divine what's meant for
this case. In those documents, CR and LF only show up as being allowed
in obs-text or obs-qp, the obsolete syntax. This would suggest removing
them from SIP as well. I've sent email to the editors of those documents
to see if they can enlighten us.

As a simple example, consider

We're talking about completely different things:

- I can, with existing tools and services, build a service today that
allows application-layer mobility, even running it out of my attic on my
DSL line with a single static IP address. (Since this fictional service
would never see a single voice packet, regardless of whether the caller
or callee supports binding updates, this would work as long as the
signaling traffic is less than about 60 kb/s in my case.) Obviously, so
could hotmail, yahoo, or a dedicated SIP "roaming" provider, without
requiring a unique IP address per customer. This would offer mobility
for customers with any type of access, as long as they have a (changing
set) of IP addresses they can be reached at. The ISPs serving the
customer are obviously not at all involved.

- I could also install a HA at home for me, but that would only work for
me (and wouldn't work if I had only dial-up access). Apparently, that's
what you're referring to.

Since I'm just coming back to a week's worth of SIP discussion, can
somebody summarize this discussion or its result, as I've lost track
what, if any changes/clarifications, should be made to The Spec?

My rough understanding is:

- SDP in 1xx means take media from there, don't generate local ring
tone. (I think there was an earlier discussion that "early media" should
not be restricted to 180 or 183.)

- Later 1xx's update SDP as usual. (This primarily affects where RTCP is
to be sent.) 

- Removing SDP switches back to local ring-back.

- It's up to the UA whether it wants to mix audio/video during call
setup if it gets multiple 1xx due to forking. (If "early media" is an
announcement like "the number you have dialed has been changed. The new
number is ...", mixing with ring tone from another destination would be
very confusing. Not sure what to do about this.)

This goes back to an earlier, long-ago discussion whether it's better to
use 4xx/5xx for announcements, but if I remember right, the conclusion
was that this wasn't always feasible since gateways wouldn't be able to
distinguish failure announcements from ring tone. (I thought the
announcement tri-tone was for stuff like that...)

- If the caller wants to change its IP address during the call setup, it
needs to CANCEL/BYE the call and try again. This may occur during really
long call setups, e.g., if somebody called me last week and wanted to
catch me as soon as I walked into the office this morning, so this is
not completely hypothetical.

Thanks.

Network Solutions, register.com or any of its competitors that offer DNS

Sir,
   I wanted to know if i have to multicast to all the subnets, would i have 
to run mrouted aplication in all of the routers in the LAN or only few. Sir, 
can u redirect me to a URI where i can get some insight into this because 
i'm searching for a solution where i have to do multicasting eventhough none 
of the routers are multicast enabled.
It might sound silly but its really difficult to convince these network adm. 
to enable multicast routers.
   In the internet we have the Mbone network to handle this type of scenario 
but Mbone is basically a network of multicast routers again.
  Please give me some details on this.
   Thanking you,
     rahul

In general, I think we want to stick with the model that REFER, and the
session during which REFER was sent, are completely unrelated.
Otherwise, we will have many complex interactions like the ones you are
asking about.

This is a known problem, already fixed in the bis draft. We use rfc2068
syntax.

Everyone,

There's a small thing I don't understand about calling proxy servers and
registrars. I'm sure there's some small thing which I'm missing, and if
anyone can clear it up I'd appreciate it.

alice@example1.com wants to call bob@example2.com (who is really now at
example3.com) using Registrar (which is both a Registrar and Redirect
Server).

If Alice wants to call Bob using a Registrar, Alice will send INVITE
bob@example2.com but will specify that the Registrar should be used as a
proxy. Therefore, the INVITE command will be sent to registrar.com instead
of bob@example2.com.

The Registrar's reaction is straightforward: send Alice a 302 Moved
Temporarily t(bob@example3.com). Alice's UAC will then attempt to INVITE
bob@example3.com -- but since the Registrar is set as the proxy, Alice's
INVITE will go back to registrar.com, not to bob@example3.com.

At the last step, I would want Alice's UA to contact bob@example3.com, but
does this mean I have to disable the proxy setting? If I do so, then how
does Alice's request to bob@example2.com get to the Registrar in the first
place to be redirected?

What am I missing here? What is the correct way to use a Registrar?

Thanks for any insight.

Garret

Hi,

The current bis draft states the following in section 15.1 PGP
Authentication Scheme ....

   "Implementations supporting this scheme MUST implement the
   definitions and default algorithms of RFC 2440 [45] and MAY implement
   the older version, based upon PGP 2.6, described in RFC 1991 [42]."

and the following in section 15.1.1 ....

"pgp-micalgorithm:

    The value of this parameter indicates the PGP
    message integrity check (MIC) to be used to produce the
    signature. If this parameter is not present, it is assumed
    to be "md5".  The currently defined values are "md5" for
    the MD5 checksum, and "sha1" for the SHA.1 algorithm.

pgp-pubalgorithm:

    The value of this parameter indicates the PGP
    public-key algorithm to be used for signing and encrypting
    messages. If this parameter is not present, it is assumed
    to be "rsa" for the RSA algorithm. The value "dsa" defines
    the DSS/DH algorithm."


The default algorithms defined in RFC2440 are ...

Public Key Algorithms

    DSA = MUST
    RSA = SHOULD

Hash Algorithms

    SHA-1 = MUST
    MD5    = SHOULD


Therefore, would it be better to specify DSA & SHA-1 as the defaults for the
respective SIP parameters?

What do you think?

Regards
Phil

I generally find the names of transferor and transferee, etc.,
confusing, particularly since this is no longer just for transfers. What
we're really doing is asking some SIP UA to send a request. I think it
would be helpful if the document used a more "application neutral"
terminology.

I accidentaly opened the joke virus, and I think that it might have been
sent to everybody on my address book. If you have received it and haven't
opened it, please don't open the email with the subject fwd: joke.

Jo, I have a fundamental disagreement here so have not read your 
entire email. See my embedded question.

I thought that if proxy B is stateful, request A-B2 will hash to 
the same transaction control block as the request A-B since the
4 tuple (Call-ID, From, To and CSeq) has not changed. Correct ??

Sir,
  In the above scenario can i use tunnelling to communicate b/w the two 
subnets, i.e. if a host in subnet1 wants to send a packet on some multicast 
address and there are few hosts in subnet2 also who are listening on that 
multicast address, will they be able to communicate with each other. Will 
the tunelling be done at the host level?
   Thanking you,
     rahul

Hey Jonathan,

Thanks for the response.

Can any member along the path introduce REFER
messages on the path or does it exclude proxies
for CSeq reasons?  Since the REFER is just 
borrowing the route and is unrelated to the
session, do all the rest of the headers
need to match up with the normal call-leg headers
specific to the path?

It seems the document has evolved to show 
how A can request B to INVITE C, instead of how 
to transfer a call.  If a REFER is unrelated to 
the path's session, I find it interesting that the 
Call Transfer draft doesn't explain how to 
perform a transfer.  :)

Please give example of headers as to avoid everyone
from producing a proprietary means to request a 
"transfer", "multi-party", or 
"establish additional unrelated call" when
sending the REFER.

Please give example of headers for how the 
Transferee knows to switch, second line, or 
multi-party the INVITE from the Transfer Target 
within 6.2.2 without presenting it the user to
decide.

Thanks,  
Brett

Hey Robert,

Thanks for the response.  You and Jonathan have
cleared up much of my (and hopefully the news
groups') understanding of the draft.

Please understand that much of my comments
are to help avoid the same questions from being
asked repeatedly within this list.  Thus, maybe
the answers or clarifications can be addressed
within the document text when appropriate.

More questions and comments inline.

Thanks,
Brett Tate

I am mainly just seeking clarity within the draft
concerning restrictions and expected results when the
REFER is used within a verity of session states and
message flow situations.

Interesting.  How else does the "Transferor" indicate
to the "Transferee" that a transfer should happen?

Thanks.  I am actually just trying to get clarity in the
draft concerning the new REFER method's effect
on basic call flows and expected results as described
in rfc2543.

Just trying to ensure clarity within the draft as a

If a transferor would like to safely send BYE
and ensure that the REFER arrives before the BYE,
a non-100 provisional response would be wonderful
to accomplish this.  The 100 should not be used,
since transaction stateful proxies use it.

It would also be wonderful in a situation where it
takes longer than 10xT2 for the Referred-To party
to answer.  Thus, the Referrer could know to
maybe try more than 11 times before giving up.

The 183 maybe could be used, but a new
provisional response might be better.

For security reasons, I agree that the "Refer-To: URI"
would be a wonderful location concerning 6.2.2.

Please respond with the header/parameter along with the
corresponding defined values and extension format.

Please provide examples within the draft and in your
response.

What do you think about using "referrer-url" or a
parameter within the Referred-By header to
address item 4 about how to know what REFER
means in relation to other established sessions
between the Referrer and Referred (or any other
sessions for which the Referred is involved)?

Would it be useful for a REFER response to
indicate if Referred honored the
"switch" , "mixed" request, or did something
else with it?

Thanks.  I assume call-ID is the catch-all means to know
for which session to apply the "quick-switch".  Is this
correct?

It would be so wonderful to define another means
in case the Referred-To currently has several sessions
in various states using the same call-ID.  Something
like a PENDING-INVITE containing the Referred-By
is one way. Maybe the INFO containing the
Referred-By might be another.

Yes, this is a problem. 

A picture to illustrate it (INV means INVITE)


  ---------                  --------                  --------
  | a@c1  | -- INV u1@p1 --> |      | -- INV u2@p2 --> |      |
  ---------  (contact a@c1)  |      |                  |      |
                             |  p1  |                  |  p2  |
  ---------                  |      |                  |      |
  | b@c2  | <- INV b@c2 ---- |      | <- INV u3@p1 --- |      |
  ---------                  --------                  --------


When b@c2 creates it's Route entry it will, according to the
spec, fill in a@c1 as URI for all the Route-entries, which
is practice means that if b@c2 issues a BYE request, it will
have the same request-URI both times p1 is visited (illegal
loop).

Obviously the problem is recognized, but shouldn't it be solved?

It is suggested that "some URI parameter" should be introduced,
but why not keep the original Request-URI-values from the
original Record-Route information?

The spec says (6.34.2): " ... Since the URIs contained in the
Record-Route header fields are not useful for the reverse request
path, the UA fills all other components of the Route name-addr 
value with the name-addr value found in the Contact or the From
field. ..."

This operation seems completely pointless to me, the spec might
as well say: since the URIs are not useful, the UA should fill
all other components with DonaldDuck@Disneyland. Its like saying 
"since this information is useless, we exchange it with another 
piece of useless information".

Obviously the original Request-URI information from the 
Record-Route wouldn't be completely useless in Route for the 
scenario above. If we were using the original URIs from Record-
Route instead we wouldn't have a problem. And those URIs
are no more fake information than the one stated in the spec.

B.2, August 6th (-01) edition says:

  For receive-only and send-or-receive streams, the port number and
   address in the session description indicate where the media stream   
   should be sent to by the recipient of the session description, either
   caller or callee.  For send-only RTP streams, the address and port   
   number indicate where RTCP reports are to be sent. (RTCP reports are 
   sent to the port number one higher than the number indicated.)

You seem to be citing something else. What am I missing?

My view is that the spec should say that a proxy is not allowed
to add itself more than once in a Record-Route path; I'm struggling
to see why it would be useful for a proxy to be present more than
once.

I don't think that's quite fair.  Putting the Contact/From address
in does vaguely make sense, because it indicates the ultimate
recipient of the message.  (One could imagine the chain of proxies
somehow breaking, but healing itself using this information.)

However, this has been slightly broken by the fact that the port
(in the Contact/From) is now corrupted by the proxy port.  This is
a shame.  And insofar as that is true, I might concede to Mr. Duck. &:)

The original Request-URI information _is_ useless for the reverse
request path.  For example, from your diagram, although u1@p1
maps to u2@p2, it in no-way implies that u2@p2 maps to u1@p1 (which
I think is what would have to happen for the Request-URIs to
make sense in reverse; something like that, anyway).

REFER is no different than any other request. Proxies don't originate
requests on their own.

REFER followed by BYE does transfer. I have no objection to example
sections in the draft which show this kind of application.

I don't know what you mean by "example of headers". The
specification defines the headers needed for the refer operation.
You can build transfer with these mechanisms plus BYE as defined 
already.

UI issues are out of scope. Why couldn't an implemenatation
present it to the user to decide? Seems like a good feature.

Reworded, again.

This leaves out the case 'TCP' and 'no existing connection'.

I also generalized from TCP to 'reliable transport protocol
such as TCP, TLS or SCTP' in line with earlier discussions.

Hi,

In the initial INVITE, how an UAS can know that the UAC is still alive?

The UAC can do this by retransmitting the INVITE periodically or by
bounding the duration of the INVITE with a Expires header, but how an
UAS can be sure that the UAC is alive (if the UAS send the 200 OK after

Subject: [SIP] Detection of UAC failure


Hi,

In the initial INVITE, how an UAS can know that the UAC is still alive?

The UAC can do this by retransmitting the INVITE periodically or by
bounding the duration of the INVITE with a Expires header, but how an
UAS can be sure that the UAC is alive (if the UAS send the 200 OK after
a very very long time), if the PRACK extension is not supported and the
UAC do not add an Expires header?

Thank you for your help,

I think the definition is crystal clear, and most apps will always be one 
or the other.  maybe you will like this better:

         If your app will *ever* terminate audio,
         then it must be ready to receive DTMF via AVT tones,
         and must never subscribe to "keypress events"

This leaves "pure" 3rd party apps (of which there are still plenty), which 
will never, ever terminate any media.  I think that something like VoXML is 
a good model here.  Send the endpoint a script or document to run.  If the 
end user does something interesting (press some keys, say something 
intelligable, etc), then execute a URL.  The URL may fetch a new script, 
contain a REFER, an INVITE, a BYE, a REGISTER, etc...

>sounds like one
>mechanism is the right way to go.

Lots of folks will want a VoXML-like model.  Only ever sending DTMF as AVT 
tones is limiting and short-sighted IMHO.

Hi,

Let me try and rephrase Brett's question.  Let's assume the following scenario:

A sends REFER to B with a Refer-To: <C>
B sends an INVITE to C with Referred-By: <A>

When C receives an INVITE with a Referred-By header, how does C know 
whether to:
         a) accept this INVITE as a new call,
         b) accept this INVITE as a replacement for another call leg, or
         c) accept this INVITE as new party in an existing call   ??

The semantics aren't well-defined yet.  The draft just mentions that you 
can include a call-id in the refer-to or referred-by URL.  It doesn't say 
what that would mean or what you should do with it.

All of these behaviors are reasonable things.  c) is useful for full mesh 
conferences, b) is needed for attended transfer and other redirection 
features, and is useful for desktop call control (my dialer REFERs my phone 
to place an INVITE to a contact).

thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

I think the proposal was:  "implementations SHOULD send in canonical 
format", or "sending in canonical format is RECOMMENDED".

These are both backward compatible.  Receiving torture cases would still be 
in the spec.

This is the case when the Call-ID is unknown.

I assume you are talking about the now-defunct Replaces: function? I
believe now
that this function is quite a complex one and something that merits much
more discussion
before deciding if its needed.

Known call-id.

Thats something that needs to be addressed in the bis draft. It needs to
say what it means to receive a call from a different party but with the
same call-ID as an existing call.

No. I do not like this. When a request spirals, its arrival at the proxy
the second time is a completely separate transaction; it has no real
bearing on the first time around. For reasons of logging, features, and
applications there are many reasons why you would want to record-route
the second time - the same reasons you wanted to do it the first time.

I actually proposed a set of possible solutions in slides I put together
for Pittsburgh IETF, but never got around to discussing. THe slides are
at:
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/IETF48/slides/pres-rosenburg-sipwg_jul00_listissues.ppt

Anyway, the solution I like best is the following: don't check for loops
in the case where there are Route headers. A little ugly, I admit, as it
creates an interaction between two components.

It maintains the fundamental principle that the request URI indicates
for whom the request is destined. By relying on Route headers to get the
request there, even though the request URI says something completely
difference, makes the operation of the protocol brittle. We have seen
this at bakeoffs - loops often occur if any proxy has anything slightly
wrong with their route processing.

I agree that we have abused the port number and maddr parameters. This
is because the initial work on record-route really focused on the
forward direction, and made the incorrect assumption that the URi
sequence could always be used to reconstruct the proxy server sequence.
As we have gradually realized the fallacy of these assumptions, we have
had to work this fix in in a backwards compatible manner.

Brett has asked for a clear semantic to the inclusion of SDP in 183.
Here is my proposal.

To keep ourselves sane, and to simplify life, I would propose that the
semantics of SDP in 183 be identical to those if the SDP were returned
in a 200. The difference is only in the call state; 200 OK means the
call is established, 183 (or any 1xx) means progress.

Based on this rule, SDP in the 183 with a 0.0.0.0 line means that the
UAS does not want to receive, just send audio. Classic one way cut
through. SDP in the 183 with a non-zero IP address and port means that
bidirectional audio is allowed; the UAC should send whatever the user is
saying. Of course, any good implementation will let the user know that
this is happening. Someone pointed out that bidirectional audio before
call acceptance doesn't work in ISUP. How, in this case, are things like
calling card numbers, etc. which require DTMF collection before call
completion, handled?

This also answers the question about turning off media stream. Same as
how re-INVITEs work. If you want to turn it off, return an SDP in
another 1xx with that m line set to port zero. Sending a 1xx later with
no SDP has the same effect as a re-invite with no SDP (which means no
change in session state at all).

I think it's important to stress the fact that "Registrar" and
"Redirect Server" are Logical Roles.  In this case, it is irrelevant
that this SIP entity also functions as a Registrar, since we are
only talking about INVITEs.

> If Alice wants to call Bob using a Registrar, Alice will send INVITE

Let's see if I'm interpreting this correctly: you're imagining a case
where you have I guess the notion of an "outbound redirect server"?

> The Registrar's reaction is straightforward: send Alice a 302 Moved
> Temporarily t(bob@example3.com). Alice's UAC will then attempt to INVITE

Yes.  This is going to be a problem, and I think the end result will
show that an "outbound redirect server" will not work in general.

But let's explore some scenarios:

1) Alice's UAC could try the Redirect Server again for bob@example3.com,
   whereupon the Redirect Server will return perhaps an IPv4 address
   (i.e., if the Redirect Server finds no registrations for some
   URL, it just tries to do the magic in section 1.4.2 of the spec).
   Since this is an IP address, Alice's UAC can try to contact Bob's
   UAS directly.

2) Alice's UAC could always try the Redirect Server first, and then
   subsequent attempts (possibly using results returned from the
   Redirect Server), do not use the Redirect Server.

3) Alice's UAC could try the Redirect Server based on some sort of
   rules; say for any addresses in the same domain.

I don't think that 1) is feasible, since you lose a lot of
information.  (One could easily imagine a situation where a proxy
serves a number of domains, and this proxy can be discovered
through SRV.  The moment you do the IP thing, the proxy has a
near-useless Request-URI.)

2) is certainly possible, but perhaps in a lot of cases utterly
pointless.  Your use of "registrar.com" makes me think that this
is some sort of service -- it's going to have to have a _huge_
database to be of any use (I wouldn't consider returning the
same SIP URL queried much of a service).

3) I can imagine as the most likely.  If Alice wants to call
someone in example1.com, her UAC uses the example1.com Redirect
Server, else the UAC does the normal 1.4.2 discovery, or perhaps
uses example1.com's Proxy Server.

> At the last step, I would want Alice's UA to contact bob@example3.com,

You mean "Redirect Server"? &:)

If you had Vendor X's UAC, which could be configured to use an
"Outbound Proxy", there is no way that you could set that to use
a Redirect Server as its Outbound Proxy.  This is because it will
_always_ (by spec definition) try to route through the Outbound
Proxy.

I would imagine that dedicated Redirect Servers are typically more
useful when situated "behind" Proxies.

HTH,

Hi Jo,

Thanks for your answer.

I would like to discuss and clarify my point of view
a bit further.

As Jonathan implies, there are cases where you
would like to do this when making proxies which controls 
services,  firewalls, whatever.

As another example (I don't know if it's a good one, but anyway)
where proxy "p1" in my picture would need to Record-Route 
itself both times, you could imagine p1 having two ethernet 
interfaces. c1 & c2 are on a local network (10.0....), which 
is reached through one of the interfaces. p2 are on a wider 
network (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx), reached through the other interface. 

If we would do what you suggest, the Record-Routing
chain would be p1 - p2 and b@c2 would construct a Route
path which would be p1 - p2 - c1. (According to the spec
today it would have been p1 - p2 - p1 - c1).

When the BYE request from b@c2 is proxied based on your 
proposed path, and arrives at p2 it wouldn't find it's 
way directly to c1 since c1 is located at the local network 
behind p1.

Well. Maybe I exhaggerated a bit, in a lame attempt to pull
a joke ;)

I would like to discuss this further, though, because I still
think my proposal is OK.

About repairing broken proxy chains; whether this is reasonable
or not; consider our small example network above, and we're
just about to proxy the BYE request from b@c2 to a@c1. Then 
suddenly, we can't contact the next proxy in our chain, and
we would like to use the request-URI to find out our final
destination. Assuming the final destination is reachable,
we would have use for the information in the Request-URI, 
and we are far better off with than information than an
address to Mr. Duck ;)

Ok, but even if the request-URI actually states
Mr. Duck, you will find the final recipient in the Route-
path anyway, if you would like to make an attempt to contact
that recipient directly. Also if a chain of proxies are
recorded, you would maybe like to bypass "as few as possible"
using the Route information to try to contact "the closest
reachable" all the time. There is really no need for information
about the final recipient to be duplicated in the request-URI
as well.

To me, it's also rather unclear to what extent you would like
to try this kind of by-passing of proxies, which insists
in being in the chain. I guess, if a proxy insists of being
in the proxy chain, it has some reason to do so. Maybe
it does stuff that are essential for the session. If such
a proxy "dies", and you happens to be successful when bypassing 
it (and maybe several others), it is undefined to me how
much the session really is "healed".

OK. I agree completely, that the request-URI is useless for
the actual routing decision, when you route based on the Route
header. Thats why I joked about putting useless information
such as godzilla@tokyo.com in the Request-URI ;)

But even though the original information is equally useless
for the actual routing decision, I think it is useful for
loop detection decisions.

Here is an example:

Consider our simple network above.

Here's what happens with the solution currently proposed in the
spec (I'm using pseudo SIP syntax because I'm too lazy doing too
much typing):

c1   --> p1   :     INVITE u1@p1
                    contact a@c1

p1   --> p2   :     INVITE u2@p2
                    contact a@c1
                    record-route u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>

p2   --> p1   :     INVITE u3@p1
                    contact a@c1
                    record-route u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>,
u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>

p1   --> c2   :     INVITE b@c2
                    contact a@c1
                    record-route u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>,
u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>, u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>


OK, so now the INVITE request has reached it's final
destination, c2,  and according to the solution proposed
in the spec today, c2 created this Route information
to be used for subsequent requests:

c2: Route = a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1<maddr=p2-addr>,
a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

Let's skip the INVITE-response & ACK and move forward
directly to the point of time when b@c2 is generating
a BYE request for the session


c2   --> p1   :     BYE a@c1
                    route a@c1<maddr=p2-addr>, a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

p1   --> p2   :     BYE a@c1
                    route a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

p2   --> p1   :     BYE a@c1         <---- loop detection ....
                    route a@c1

p1   --> p2   :     Loop detect ...


You see, when the request reaches proxy p1 the second time
with the same request-URI, it will be considered a loop,
and the transaction will not be successful, even if it
should be.


Let's go for the alternative that I proposed, which is simply 
to keep the original request-URI-information. Then after
Record-Routing the INVITE, c2 would create this Route:

c2: Route = u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>,
u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

OK, now b@c2 will send a BYE using that information:

c2   --> p1   :     BYE u1@p1
                    route u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>, u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>,
a@c1

p1   --> p2   :     BYE u2@p2
                    route u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

p2   --> p1   :     BYE u3@p1
                    route a@c1

p1   --> c1   :     BYE a@c1 


Sheer success ;) ;)

I have to say that I don't see why it would be so difficult for
the Proxy to note that this transaction actually corresponds to
N other transactions, and update state as appropriate...

Interesting.

You are right, my "solution" would break down here.  However, I
would note that p1 might have to be careful when it Record-Route d,
in that it would have to present an maddr parameter that resolved
appropriately whichever "side" of the proxy you were facing.
(i.e., if the proxy had a different IP on each interface, it would
have to use a domain name that resolved to the right IP for both
p2 and c1/c2.)

(But we're probably roaming into the nightmarish world of NATs
[NATmare, anybody?], now.  For instance, what if c1 wanted to
call c3, which happened to reside on the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx network?
SDP is going to be wrong, etc., etc..)

I think that a proxy that thinks it can be clever by optimising

frowned upon. &:)

Yes, this is true; the chain is probably still quite ill.

I think my sentiment was best expressed by Johnathan:

No, that's not why I said it was useless.  I meant that it was
useless because in every case, ignoring the Route header, the
Request-URI was pointing at something that in most cases, would
never resolve to the calling party.

That is, if the Route header were "lost", no matter how hard
any proxy tried, it would be unlikely that it could figure out
that u3@p1 (which would be the first Route Request-URI by your
method) should be forwarded to a@c1.

No, you've got the Route wrong, it should be:
u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>, u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>

> OK, now b@c2 will send a BYE using that information:

Although this should be "BYE u3@p1", I think the problem is still
clear.  Ignore the Route header.  Now p1 resolved u2@p2 to u3@p1
(and u1@p1 to u2@p2) the in the "forward" direction, but it's
pretty unlikely to do the reverse in the "reverse" direction.

As Johnathan said, Record-Route has been somewhat abused by maddr
and port, but using the Contact/From gives us the best we can do
without sacrificing backward compatibility.

Yes, these requests are identical based on the isomorphism rules
(should really also be considering Request-URI and topmost-Via).
I was alluding to this with my observation that ACKs/CANCELs are
problematic; and in any case, I explicitly addressed the point
later on (where I talked about "aggressive" loop detection).

This isn't a helpful observation since, as I understand it, this
is how loops are supposed to be detected when Via hiding is
employed.  That is why I'm arguing against. &:)

Hi Jonathan,

   Thanks for your answer.

   I would like to discuss this subject further though.

   Ok, I have looked at your slides and I found two proposed
   solutions.

   I guess your solution based on not doing loop detection
   when a request contains Route header could be fine solving
   that specific problem.

   But the thing is, the loop detection problem might not be the 
   only problem which occurs due to the UAS removal of the original 
   request-URI information from the Record-Route when creating
   it's Route. 

   Let's look at this network (all proxies are stateful)
   :)


   --------             ------    ---u1@p1----->  ------
   |      |             |    |    |               |    |
   | a@c1 |  -user@fp-> | p1 | ------u2@p1----->  | p2 |   ... continued
   |      |             |    |    |               |    |
   --------             ------    ---u3@p1----->  ------


   I'm not really good at ascii graphics, so I only draw half
   the picture ;). I will try to describe the rest verbally.

   In proxy p2, three INVITE requests will be received
   with the same call leg, but representing different
   transactions, needing separated transaction handling.
   (For example, each of the transactions in p1 could generate
   a new fork from p1 to a number of different servers generating
   a number of different response codes and needing their
   own handling of UDP re-transmissions and more.)

   So, since we have several transaction handlers in p2
   for the same call leg, we need something more than the
   call leg to identify the different transactions. And the
   only thing that I can think of that would be sort of static
   for the transaction/session would be the request-URI.

   And the only time I could think of where it wouldn't work 
   is because the request-URI-information is removed by the called UA 
   from the Record-Route when called UA creates the Route.

   If this is a real problem (maybe you know of a solution
   other than using the request-URIs), I think it should not be
   of great significance that the fundamental principle of the
   request-URI (that you should be able to use it for routing
   at all times) would be broken using the original request-
   URI-information for Route. I think that principle was broken 
   at the moment Record-Route/Route was introduced to SIP.

   Best Regards,

      Loita Jahnsson

Session timers can only be used after the session is established (or am
I wrong?). My question is how to know if the client is alive, before
sending the 200 OK:

UAC        UAS
 | INVITE   |
 |--------->|
 | 100      |
 |<---------|
 | 180      |
 |<---------|
 |          |
Here there is a long long time and the user do not pickup the phone (if
its a telephony application). If the UAC is dead, the phone continue to
ring (the crash of the UAC will be detected when the 200 is send, but
that's not the point). How I can check that the UAC is alive without
using PRACK?

i dont really know if this is the form to discuss these things .. but
nevertheless, here i go.

this is about using SIP for Instant Messaging. I have been working on
creating small footprint telephony and instant messaging systems and over
the past few weeks i have got busy trying to implement this on sip. these
are the issues that we must face with IM on SIP.
I would also like to point out that as the initial implementations of SIP
are going to be predominantly on the Net, it will be a commercial nessecity
to implement IM along with voice. the fact is that people on the Net prefer
text to voice.

1. the MESSAGE request carries a callid. thus, if two people exchange
messages with the same callid, they should show up on the same windows for
both the users. This is pretty straightforward. What is not straightforward
is the question of treating an exchange of messages as a session. I think
that we should because the users will look at it that way and the software
authors (including I) will implement it that way. When my software gets a
message for a callid, i look up the current list of windows open and match
the message's callid with that of the window and if no window is found, then
the user agent will prompt the user to open a new window.

2. Okay, the MESSAGE is extremely efficient. I haven't seen anything
quicker, simpler and more sophisticated. It is ideal for a two party
conference. What happens when you want to join a third party to your two way
IM chat? Actually, MESSAGE can handle this, each person will have to send a
copy of MESSAGE to all the participants in the call (sharing the same
callid). Now how is a new participant invited to a group session of IM?
please note that we are already using words like session and invite. Thus,
we also need to be able to specify a group of users that the called party
will have to send MESSAGEs to.
This is my suggestion for an IM group chat INVITE:

INVITE sip:newone@somewhere.com
To: sip:newone@somewhere.com
From: sip:caller@elswhere.com
Call-ID: 123456789@elsewhere.com
CSeq: 1 INVITE
Content-Type:application/sdp

v=0
o=caller 32434 23424 IN IP4 202.54.30.24
s=Chat session

m=application 5060 SIP/2.0 MESSAGE
a=participant:first@hostx.com
a=participant:second@hosty.com
a=participatn:third@hostz.com

I have implemented this and also seen it work on my UA. Although my
implementation is still a few days old, I dont forsee any problems. It is
simple and easily understood.

I have also examine the RTP text payload RFC. It is not suitable as it is
has no error correction. we need something as efficient as the MESSAGE and
also as simple.

You got it. This was exactly what I ment in the proposal.

I have received a number of responses to this mail. There seems to be
three different views to the proposal.

1) Yes, the proposal would simplify my SIP parsing please accept the 
   proposal.

2) The proposal is OK, but since there are so many implementation
   of SIP and the change is not backwards compatible it's to late
   to do the change.

3) Don't change because we wan't the freedom of sending the SIP messages
   in any way we want. It's not many extra lines of code to parse the
   different options.


Group one is not much to comment since it accept the proposed changes.

The Group two comments I don't understand. The change I suggested IS
backwards compatible. What I suggested was to depricate all other
formats
except the cannonical form _when sending_. This means that everyone that 
today fullfills the rfc will be able to receive the canonical form. 
The proposal suggests that only the canonical form SHOULD be used when 
sending which opens up the possibility to remove the other formats in
the 
future. When that is done it will not be backwards compatible but
hopefully 
everyone have adopted to the canonical form at that time so it will not
be 
a big problem. 
This is the exact same thing that was done with the different ways of 
terminating the header lines. Why was that change accepted ? Was that 
change backwards compatible ? 

The third group want the freedom of sending the messages in basically
any
way they want. And they also say that it's no problem of parsing the 
different formats because a few lines of PERL will fix that. First of
all I'm not shure PERL is available on all small devices that will have
to parse the SIP messages. Secondly I think that when you want to send 
things in any way you want you also have to be prepared to receive
things 
in any way and that only complicates things without any gain at all.
In the telecom world, where I come from, we have limited amount of 
bandwidth and processor power but that don't seem to be the case here. 
If a product is more expensive than necessary (due to a more powerful 
processor or/and more memory) isn't that a problem ?  

Finally I just want to comment the PERL code that Brian F. G. Bidulock
sent in. The code looks nice but you actually managed to prove my point
with your code. You failed to take care of comma separated lists and 
the different ways of terminating a header line. So if the canonical
form would have been the only form your code would have worked fine.

So my point is : if you have several optional ways of doing things 
it's easy to forget one of them. So thanks Brian for proving my point.

Hello again,

I just wonder why there is a possibility to hide the Via headers
but not the Record-Route headers ? 

I can see the need for hiding the Via headers so the callee can't
see which way the call took. But the Record-Route together with
Contact basically gives the same information so why aren't there
any Record-Route hiding ??

I don't like this alternative as it makes it impossible for the caller
to send RTCP in response to early media. Instead,

a=sendonly

seems like the more appropriate mechanism. (There's also a security
implication: if the UAS sends an IP address, the receiver at least has a
chance of rejecting bogus audio packets as long the attacker can't
intercept the SDP *and* forge IP addresses. Without this, it would be
pretty easy to just send RTP as 'early media' to any local SIP phone,
for example.)

Jo,

Thanks for the very helpful response.

I think the most helpful thing I gained from the discussion is that one does
not want to configure a UAC to use a pure redirect server as its proxy. This
would be pointless, because each request, regardless of the Reguest-URI,
would be directed to the redirect server -- assumedly including even
redirects.

I think that's close to what we've discovered we need to do. All requests
for bob@example1.com would go through the example1.com Redirect Server
(which in this case is also a Registrar), and if Bob is to be elsewhere
(say, at example2.com), he REGISTERs with the server with a To: of
bob@example1.com and a Contact: of bob@example2.com .

Thanks again,

Garret

This was discussed on the SIP List around the middle of July.
I think the conclusion was that it could be done, but it was

I'm happy with the AVT tone format for transport of DTMF.  I can request
that media type and direct it independently from other media.  I also expect
to be able to use this media format independently and in addition to any
other method for transporting DTMF or other "user input".  If an endpoint
supports both RTP-DTMF and some event reporting mechanism (SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY)
then I expect I can request either or both.  The associated IDs and RFCs do
not place any limitations on this that I can see.  If there are additional
mechanisms - great.  I like choices.

I do look forward to seeing support for draft-camarillo-sip-sdp-00.txt.  I
think this will encourage support for the transmission of multiple copies of
a media "stream" to different destinations.  And I look forward to support
for terminal events using SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.  I think this can help in
addressing concerns with reliable delivery of user input.  Hopefully work in
both of these areas moves along to completion.

Regards,
Bert

I think the definition is crystal clear, and most apps will always be
one 
or the other.  maybe you will like this better:

         If your app will *ever* terminate audio,
         then it must be ready to receive DTMF via AVT tones,
         and must never subscribe to "keypress events"

This leaves "pure" 3rd party apps (of which there are still plenty),
which 
will never, ever terminate any media.  I think that something like
VoXML is 
a good model here.  Send the endpoint a script or document to run.  If
the 
end user does something interesting (press some keys, say something 
intelligable, etc), then execute a URL.  The URL may fetch a new
script, 
contain a REFER, an INVITE, a BYE, a REGISTER, etc...

>sounds like one

Lots of folks will want a VoXML-like model.  Only ever sending DTMF as
AVT 
tones is limiting and short-sighted IMHO.

In general, I suspect that Via hiding may turn out to be only marginally
useful. If you want true anonymity, hiding a few SIP servers in the path
isn't very helpful. You'll probably end up with a back-to-back UA that
also hides your media IP address and any other incriminating
identifiers, such as Contacts, network identifiers in SDP and call-ids.
Without that, the danger of information leakage is too great to use it
for anything where something of value (your life, your whistleblower
premium, your protection from telemarketers,  ...) depends on it. For
just caller identity anonymity, you don't need Via hiding.

I would dispute that it is significantly different than via hiding.

See our ID "SIP Record-Route/Route Hiding"

If UDP is used, then the 1xx responses from UAS can arrive out of
order in the UAC. So how can the UAC knows which response sent first?

Or should we mandate that the version number in the SDP origin field
MUST be increased when UAS changes the SDP in 1xx?

Bertil,

Do you even have a `C' complier on that phone of yours?  I suggest you
check out the POSIX regex functions which are as good as PERL.
No POSIX?  Why not get Pete to do it for you on a diode?

No, it handled line-folding, which is what I was discussing at the time.
It was an example.  See another example which does more below:

I didn't ``forget one,'' I just showed line folding!  I don't know what
point you think I helped you prove, 'cause I don't think you have a point.

Working along on my PERL example, I have added a few features (in 15
minutes), trying ever so hard not too overlook several.

    ($header, $body) = split(/\r?\n\r?\n/,$msg,2);
    ($start, $header) = split(/\r?\n/,$header,2);
    
    $header =~ s/\r\ni:/\r\nCall-ID:/gi;

    @headers = split(/(?:^|\r?\n)(\S+?)\s*:\s*/s,$header);
    shift @headers;
    
    for ($i=0;$i<=$#headers;$i=$i+2) {
        $value = $headers[$i+1];
        @parms =
          split(/(?:^|\s*,\s*)((?:(?:[^,"\\]|\\.)|"(?:[^\\"]|\\.)*")*)/sg,
                $value);
        shift @parms;
        for ($j=0;$j<=$#parms;$j=$j+2) {
            push @{$headers{lc $headers[$i]}}, $parms[$j];
            # lc handles capitalization
        }
    }
    
    print $start;
    foreach $k ( keys %headers ) {
        print $k.' : '.join(" , \n\t",@{$headers{$k}});
    }
    printf "\n".$body;

On your original beef list, here are the things
that the EXAMPLE handles:

I'll leave the last three as an exercise to you, Bertil.  (Notice that it
prints the message back out with spaces all over the place, folding lines,
all multiple headers concatenated into comma-separated lists. It can even
handle it's own ugly output ;)

I'm sure folks will want to do things like:

         Attended transfer
         Consultative Conference
         transitioning from a 3-way call to an MCU controlled conference
         screening voicemail messages
         etc...

I could go on for pages.

All these features require a way to take an existing call leg, replace it 
with another, and keep the old resources (speaker/microphone, DS0, video 
window, whatever) associated with the new call leg.

I don't think this is sufficient.  First, I think the existing call-id is 
better suited for replacement of call legs as described above.

Second, from the definition of call, conference, session, and call-id in 
the bis draft, I have always interpreted this to mean that if A calls B, 
and B calls C, if you join these two calls together, they need to keep 
unique call ids.  Neither call was invited by a common source, and neither 
call necessarily has or will use the same session description.

from the bis draft:
>Call: A call consists of all participants in a conference invited by a 
>common source. A SIP call is identified by a globally unique call-id 
>(Section 6.12). Thus, if a user is, for example, invited to the same

We need a way to semantically link multiple calls with distinct call-ids.

Even without regexp, in C or Perl, handling multiple spaces and line
folding is a minor inconvenience, on the order of at most a few tens of
lines of code and a few extra states in the parser (e.g., for handling
"header" and ":" as separate states instead of comparing just
"header:").

I'm not sure that robustness would be served by anybody relying on the
canonical representation. In some sense, you *want* a significant
fraction of the implementations to use non-canonical coding since this
makes it much more likely that you'll discover interoperability problems
earlier rather than after the beta test period. Finger-pointing at that
point is not particularly productive. "You mean you rejected the 911
call since the call had an extra space after the token?"

Thus, I don't see what the SHOULD buys you beyond surprises in the field
that take far longer to debug than spending a few hours extra on
building a robust parser to begin with.

All the noises about improved efficiency remain, so far, unproven
assertions.

Henning,

Souce code for `formail' might give someone an idea: I haven't seen it
munge an e-mail header line or body, ever...  It even get's loosey goosey
with the Content-Length when given the '-y' flag.  It's written in `C',
portable to assembler, or diodes, I'm sure!

That someone was me, so I feel compelled to reply. Actually, I mentioned
Q.931, not ISUP. I would guess that the same principles apply to ISUP, but I
am not an SS7 expert.

I believe that Q.931 does allow cut-through audio to be set up during the
"overlapped dialing" phase of the call. In this scenario, while the caller
is still issuing INFO messages containing the dialed digits, the callee
sends a PROGRESS message indicating the presence of cut-through audio. The
caller sets up an audio path in the backwards direction only. Note that in
this situation, the DTMF digits are being sent in the signalling path, not
in the media path.

I believe the equivalent in SIP would be for the callee to send a 183 with a
"send only" SDP. The caller would use multiple INVITEs to extend the
destination address string.

Of course, another possibility in Q.931 would be to send a CONNECT message
to connect the call and create a two-way audio path, and then listen for
DTMF in the audio stream. The equivalent in SIP would be to issue a 200 OK.

I'm not sure of all the details of what happens when you make a calling-card
call from a pay phone, say. Perhaps someone could address that, although I'm
not sure it would be relevant to SIP.

Certainly it is true that SIP is not a telephony protocol, and it is not
necessarily the case that things in SIP should work the same way they do in
PSTN protocols. However, purely from the point of view of semantics, if the
purpose of an INVITE is to create a session, and if a full two-way media
stream is created before the INVITE transaction is complete, things seem a
little wonky: a session has been created, therefore the INVITE transaction
should have terminated. All the examples that Brett gave relating to the
early two-way media stream involved DTMF collection. In a sense, then, the
early two-way media stream is a work-around for not being able to, or not
wanting to, send DTMF tones in the signalling path.

All that said, I have to admit that there is a certain attraction to having
attachments work identically whether in 1xx's or 200's. Still.... 

It may well be that a given UAC is unwilling or unable to set up a two-way
early media path as requested by a UAS. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to
specify what the UAC should do in that case: should it set up a one-way
media path, or should it refuse to set up any media at all?

I see the use of 183 as a means to have media sent from the UAC to the UAS
prior to session establishment (bi-directional early media).  RFC2543bis
already supports sending media to a UAC if it includes a session description
in its INVITE.  I don't see sending a 183 as being required if a UAS only
wants to send early media, except in the case it wants to stop local
ringback.  (Which in almost all cases is anytime it wants to send early
media.)  Otherwise, a 183 sent by a UAS with a session description can
indicate what media it will send (IP address = 0.0.0.0 and port = 0 or
a=sendonly) as a "courtesy" to the UAC or, what media it is prepared to
receive (SDP with non-zero address and port).

Anyway, I like the proposal below. It works great for me.  It allows
pre-call announcements and the ability to receive caller "feedback" at the
UAS prior to session establishment.

Regards,
Bert

OK, I like this much better too.

You will need to use reliable provisional responses whether you send one
183 or more. Reliable provisional responses also gives you ordering.

No; one can imagine "early media" that uses speech recognition. 

I agree its on the clunky side; in the absence of the PSTN I would argue
for sending a 200 and forgetting about this early media stuff. But,
we've been through it before and it appears critical for PSTN
interoperability. To minimize damage, I am proposing that the handling
of SDP in 183 mirror that of SDP in 200 OK, so that they are nearly the
same.

Nothing forces a client to send media even if the other side indicates
it wishes to receive it. A UAC that refuses to do two way early media
simply won't sent early media irrespective of the SDP in the 1xx.


We should be sure to capture all of this in the bis draft.

I've been plugging REFERS into call flows for each of the services you list
in your latest comment, and it works on the assumption that matching call-id
means that party C shouldn't indicate it is busy or invoke call waiting.
These flows actually take advantage of the fact that the old call leg
remains in place until explicitly taken down.

The specification as written already defines the notion of a "session"
for IMs. Its optional; you can always treat each IM independently.

This seems similar to the fully distributed multiparty conferencing
concepts, but using SDP to convey that information instead of SIP. 

In general, I believe we will be able to reuse all of the conferencing
mechanisms being developed for SIP for IM as well.

It provides redundancy which will perform just as well. I think there is
room for both as they serve different applications.

You could poll it with an OPTIONS, but I think this not really worth it.
This is a corner case; the failure will be detected when the ACK never
shows up for the 200 OK.

This is a good question; one that we have mentioned in passing here and
there, but for which we have not  yet settled on a solution.

Let me rephrase the problem. A user makes a call from a PSTN phone
through a PSTN->SIP gateway. This call arrives at a proxy server, then
gets routed to a UAS. Either or both of the proxy/UAS might challenge
this request. In this case, who is being authenticated, the gateway
itself, or the user calling in through the gateway? If its the user
themselves, how would that work?

One might argue that authentication of a gateway by a proxy is useless;
really in this case you want a hop by hop security mechanism like IPSec
or TLS, and forgo completely the high overhead SIP authentication for
each message. Then again, in the absence of support for IPSec or TLS,
SIP proxy authentication migth provide a way to authenticate the gateway
from a proxy.

It also seems unlikely the UAS would really be interested in
authenticating the originating gateway.

So, given there are useful cases for authenticating both the gateway and
the user calling in through the gateway, how do we know which is being
challenged?

Some options:

1. The realm indicates this. For example, a realm of "gateway" would
indicate that the gateway is being authenticated, "user" means the user.
We wouldn't need to standardize the actual words here, but rather
standardize that the realm would indicate which was the case through
administrative configuration.

2. Use a different response code for each case. Probably not a great
idea.

3. Others?


I'll also note that this problem is not limited to gateways - its the
fundamental issue of whether you authenticate a device or a user, and
could equally well apply to a softphone application, single line
gateway, and trunking gateway.

Thoughts on this issue?

Hi Jo!

Thanks for your answer!

I think I was a bit too eager to prove my point, so
I was careless when writing my example. Both Record-
Route and as a consequence Route is wrong there.

Each host should push itself first in the Record-Route
list (which I didn't do).

The called UA should maintain the order of the entries
in the list though, read 6.34.2 in the spec:

"If a UA finds a Record-Route header in a request
received as a UAS, it copies the Record-Route maddr
parameters and any port value, maintaining their ordering ... "

I am sorry about the confusion I caused by writing
my example carelessly.

What I was trying to show however, is the benefit
of keeping the original URI information when the
called UA is building it's Route information. 

I know you recognized this, Jo, but I want to correct 
the example anyway, in case other would read it ;)
The modified example is included below.

I would also like to say something about the reasons
given for keeping the spec the way it is.

OK. Let's look at the similarlity between Via headers and
Route headers as far as routing concerns.

Via - Response - routing:

* Via is a list of destinations that should be used
  when routing the response. 

* If the Via is constructed in a wrong manner the routing 
  of the response will fail.

* You don't have a response-URI to make a second routing
  attempt with if the Via-routing fails.

Route - Request - routing:

* Route is a list of destinations that should be used
  when routing the request. 

* I think similarly to the Via - if the Route is constructed 
  in a wrong manner the routing should fail. As I wrote in 
  a previous posting it is undefined how much you would be able 
  to heal a session anyway. 

  You have to be able to trust Route in the same manner you 
  trust the Via for a response!!!!

* When using Route, you don't need a request-URI to
  be able to perform the routing task. 

But, here is my statement, which if it's wrong I would
like an explanation of why it's wrong:

The request-URI in SIP today has dual purpose, (i)
routing (when Route is not present), (ii) to together
with the call leg identify transactions within a
stateful SIP proxy.

For the sake of (ii) the request-URI _is_ important
at all times, also when routing with Route. (Look at
the example net I made in my answer to Jonathan, and
you will see what I mean).

So I would wish that we could be pragmatic about this
and keep the original URI information from Record-Route
when building the Route at all times.

I really hope this discussion will be continued.

-------- MODIFIED EXAMPLE ---------------------------------------


c1   --> p1   :     INVITE u1@p1
                    contact a@c1
 
p1   --> p2   :     INVITE u2@p2
                    contact a@c1
                    record-route u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>

p2   --> p1   :     INVITE u3@p1
                    contact a@c1
                    record-route u2@p1<maddr=p2-addr>,
u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>

p1   --> c2   :     INVITE b@c2
                    contact a@c1
                    record-route u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>,
u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>, u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>

OK, so now the INVITE request has reached it's final
destination, c2,  and according to the solution proposed
in the spec today, c2 created this Route information
to be used for subsequent requests:

c2: Route = a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1<maddr=p2-addr>,
a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

Let's skip the INVITE-response & ACK and move forward
directly to the point of time when b@c2 is generating
a BYE request for the session

c2   --> p1   :     BYE a@c1
                    route a@c1<maddr=p2-addr>, a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

p1   --> p2   :     BYE a@c1
                    route a@c1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

p2   --> p1   :     BYE a@c1         <---- loop detection ....
                    route a@c1

p1   --> p2   :     Loop detect ...


You see, when the request reaches proxy p1 the second time
with the same request-URI, it will be considered a loop,
and the transaction will not be successful, even if it
should be.

Let's go for the alternative that I proposed, which is simply
keep the original request-URI-information. Then after
Record-Routing the INVITE, c2 would create this Route:

c2: Route = u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>,
   u1@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

OK, now b@c2 will send a BYE using that information:

c2   --> p1   :     BYE u3@p1
                    route u2@p2<maddr=p2-addr>, u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>,
a@c1
 
p1   --> p2   :     BYE u2@p2
                    route u3@p1<maddr=p1-addr>, a@c1

p2   --> p1   :     BYE u1@p1
                    route a@c1

p1   --> c1   :     BYE a@c1

Hi,

   I'd like to clarify the example I made yesterday, because
   I made a typo.

   It should look like this:


   --------             ------    ---u1@p2----->  ------
   |      |             |    |    |               |    |
   | a@c1 |  -user@fp-> | p1 | ------u2@p2----->  | p2 |   ... continued
   |      |             |    |    |               |    |
   --------             ------    ---u3@p2----->  ------


   In other word, proxy p1 forks the requests to three different
   users at proxy p2.

   
   This is where the request-URI is needed to separate the
   transactions (or at least I believe so).

   I think basically, the problem was recognized when you had
   the spiral discussion previously this year. Then it was
   recognized that the request-URI had to be taken into account
   when separating the transactions at the proxy for the spiral
   case. And after that discussion, it is taken into account, 
   because the branch values are generated partially based on the 
   request-URI information.

   But I believe the problem is more of a general nature and
   not limited to the case of spirals/loops alone, and that
   it should be recognized that the request-URI also serves
   (together with the call leg) as a transaction identifier
   for a state-ful proxy.


   Best Regards,

Hi,
	I have a few suggestions on IM sessions. 

	1. There was the question of session invitation,i.e. how
to invite someone to an IM session?

	I feel that a special invitation is not required here, as 
the first MESSAGE request will itself be an invitation to the 
other party. If that party wishes to refuse the call then they 
respond with a 403 Forbidden response. 

	2. The question of a multiparty IM session was raised. 
IMO this can be done using the folowing ways. 

	A. Sending party sends separate MESSAGE requests to each
	member. But the message may contain a header(To be defined)
	that tells the recipients the list of participants to whom 
	the message was sent so that they may also send messages to 
	all the others. 

	B. Sending party sends it to a special server that does the 
	distribution. Here the server immediately responds with a 	
	201 response, and separately sends it to the parties. But 
	if a party responds with a 403 then further messages of the
	same session or Call ID are not forwarded to that party. 

	C. Multicast requests. 

There is this question of closing a session still remaining. 
Or is the session assumed to be closed when the party just 
closes a window. 

Please comment. I also hope this is the list to which this message 
is to be sent.

I've been thinking about the device vs. user issue for a while.
My conclusion is that you need to cater to both, and they
are distinct problems.  When you try to make them the same
problem, you get wrapped around the proverbial axle.

Think of it as person-to-person instead of station-to-station
calling -- geez, there are probably a bunch of you who don't
know what the heck that means :(

User authentication implies either that there is an external
device (smartcard reader, or more probably a Bluetooth connection
to a PDA) OR a login mechanism.  It would use Kerberos or PK
to authenticate a USER.  It's clearly E-2-E, and implies proxies
don't have a role.

Device authentication is usually simpler.  You can use a pretty wide
variety of mechanisms, and it's probably okay, in most cases, to 
use Hop-by-hop mechanisms.  I do worry about that "in most cases",
but maybe something like tunnel mode IPSEC could fix enough of them
that we just use that approach.  I myself like the PacketCable
mechanisms, but there are several others than can work.  Proxies
clearly could/would participate.

Anyway, I do think we need to keep the issues separate.

In a distributed system, it will always take O(time estimate of longest
likely sequence of packet loss) to detect outages of another end system.
In addition, there is no clear delineation between "long sequence of
packet loss" and "network dead", unless you have some direct way of
observing the physical infrastructure.

Rather than just kick this around for a bit and drop it
without consensus it would be nice to reach closure.

How about we just don't do loop detection 
if there is a Route: to follow. Has anyone got a 
good reason not to take this simple approach?

BTW there were some slight errors in the modified
example which I have commented on below in case they
caused any confusion.

Cheers,
Neil.

    It depends. Clearly the gateway must proxy the
    authentication no matter what.

   Probably, though you may again want to have a "default"
   service which is authenticated as the gateway (directly
   or implicitly through the lower level SA) and a user
   authenticated service.

   Why not? It may very well be that I don't trust
   or have control over my first hop proxy. Assuming
   that the gateway had a default secondary dialtone
   IVR maze which would change the From: address and
   respond to any challenges with a PIN, this is 
   pretty much exactly what you'd want.

   I think it's a slippery slope trying to draw
   a difference between "gateway" and "user". A 
   better way to think of this, IMO, is that a
   particular device may at any time take on one
   or more identities, and that at any point each
   proxy/UAS is entitled to demand authentication
   for an identity in its realm. This is consistant
   with real life: I have a drivers license for
   driving, a credit card for buying dinner and
   a cisco badge for getting into our buildings.
   At each place, a different identity is stored in
   those pieces of plastic and each demand the
   proper one for its realm.

   Yes, I'll say again that like my wallet, it
   is necessary to be brutally parsimonious about
   the size of credentials. For SIP, I really,
   really think we need to introduce the concept
   of cached credentials on the UA/proxies so that
   you can transfer a relatively large and/or
   expensive credential (kerberos ticket,
   X.509...) once, and use a keyed hash for
   subsequent messages. If it were just one
   credential that might be demanded upon the
   path, it might be OK (and with public key
   operations, even that is doubtful), but the
   possibility of an unlimited (where for both
   kerberos and X.509 "unlimited" is > 2) set
   of credentials means that you couldn't do
   UDP INVITE's without fragmentation which 
   really sux.

   An iterative model of challenge/response/cache
   where the UAC sends a keyed hash based on a
   shared symmetric key after the initial
   challenge would scale *much* better.

Recently, a member of one of the mailing lists had their system infected
with a virus, which was then sent to the list server and dutifully
resent out to hundreds of people on one of the lists.

To help prevent such an occurence in the future, I have begun stripping
certain attachments out of mail sent to the lists. In the place of the
attachment, there will be a notice that the file was stripped from the
mail, and why.

File attachments with the following extensions will be automatically
stripped from all mail sent to lists distributed from this server:

	exe, vbs, lnk, pif, wsh, wse, jscript, kix, shs & msi

Because they are deemed important to the proper running of some of the
lists, Microsoft Word (.doc) and Microsoft Powerpoint (.ppt) files will
continue to be allowed as attachments, along with anything else not
covered by the above list of file extensions being disallowed.

Please send any questions, concerns, or comments regarding this policy,
to:

	listadmins@research.bell-labs.com

Your Friendly List Admin,

	-ste (Shaun Erickson, ste@research.bell-labs.com)

So in the interim, you assume the calls are joined/mixed?

Also, if the gateway provides the caller id (e.g., as From), the UAS

Also note that the realm is the challenge *from* the UAS, so this would
not be particularly useful in the general case.

The model seems a bit different depending on whether we're talking about
basic/digest or PGP (or S/MIME) authentication.

For basic/digest authentication, the gateway would have to know a user
id and password registered with the remote UAS, appropriate for the
realm "challenge". It's not likely that either a gateway or proxy will
know what user names and passwords are valid at the callee UAS. (It is
much more likely that a GUI-equipped SIP UAC will have this information,
e.g., embedded in an address book or other cache, similar to how web
browsers handle authentication.)

For PGP or S/MIME, this is much more likely, as long as I can get
something that is certified. Again, very similar to server
authentication in a web case. In that model, the UAS would simply get
"this call originated from a gateway that has the private key of
Telephant Telephone Company." This would likely be good enough for me to
judge whether this company will deal with crank calls appropriately and
whether the caller id is more than a random bit string. (What you really
want is probably something stronger, such as a way to find out whether
this entity is certified in some way to have these properties, as the
average callee is unlikely to recognize Granby Telephone, say.)

Since the number of calls from a particular gateway to a particular UAS
are likely going to be very low in most instances (I'd guess no more
than ten a day), long-lived associations or caching aren't any more
necessary than for S/MIME or PGP-secured email.

   I guess I'm missing the huge difference
   here. Both situations the UAC is somewhat
   clueless about what credentials it needs
   to ship for the URI. It can guess, and may
   do a reasonable job at that, but it looks
   fundamentally the same to me.

   The caching may not be very important on the UAS.
   It becomes more important the farther upstream
   you go. It seems silly to always be shipping
   credentials to my first hop proxy, for example,
   when a far simpler keyed hash would do. The 
   trick for the UA's is to know when the
   credential has been cached so that it can use
   the faster method. This is trivial for the
   first hop, but problematic at subsequent hops
   since you don't exactly know how a particular
   request URI will be routed until you try it.
   Maybe there's some algorithmic ways of
   accomplishing that, but I suspect that
   heuristics may be easier to implement and
   provide adequate results.

Below is some text trying to summarize this discussion. I'm not sure we
agreed on the parts marked with ???


Informational (1xx) responses {\MAY} contain message bodies, including
session descriptions.  Later session descriptions override earlier ones.
The session description allows the UAC to receive special announcements
or progress tones.  If a 1xx response contains a session description, a
UAC {\SHOULD} cease generating local ringback tone, but resume local
ringback tone if it receives a 1xx response without a message body from
the same destination.  The media streams are assumed to be bidirectional
unless marked as send-only or receive-only, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:sdp}.  Removing the session description in a subsequent
provisional response restores normal ringback behavior. ??? Client
behavior
when receiving several different session descriptions from different
branches is undefined. ???


Finally, there's a small bug in the current definition of the send-only
and receive-only description in Section B.2. RFC 2327 says:

 a=recvonly
       This specifies that the tools should be started in receive-only
       mode where applicable. It can be either a session or media
       attribute, and is not dependent on charset.

This is presumably from the viewpoint of the receiver of the SDP. (This
would certainly be true if I used SDP to invite somebody to a multicast
conference.)  Thus, if the caller wants to only send, it should
logically include a 'recvonly' in its SDP, since that's what the
receiver of the SDP (the callee) would have to do.

In the current SIP B.2 definition, 

   If a session description from a caller contains a media stream which
   is listed as send (receive) only, it means that the caller is only
   willing to send (receive) this stream, not receive (send). The same
   is true for the callee.

This says the opposite: the caller that only sends would set the
description to send-only. It may be too late to fix this, depending on
whether anybody actually implements sendonly and recvonly.

No, this is very different. In the certificate (X.509, S/MIME, PGP)
case, the UAC doesn't need to know anything about the receiver. It
simply sends a cert saying "CA X believes I'm Telephant Telecom. If you
believe CA X, you'll trust that I'm indeed Telephant." For basic and
digest, the UAC has to know

- what user id's are valid at the UAS
- what secrets are associated with those userids.

Generally, a gateway calling a random SIP URL (obtained via enum, say),
would have no clue about any of these.

Actually, those probably shouldn't be sent at all to an open-standards
list, as they are proprietary formats that are difficult for a
significant fraction (i.e., those not using Microsoft operating systems)
to read and are themselves likely to contain viruses.

   Not true. You are still guessing that the UAS will
   trust that certificate hierarchy. That may not be
   a valid assumption. It's the exact same problem 
   as guessing which basic/digest realm might be needed
   along the way. I can just as easily posit a global
   symmetric key realm as a global PKI realm. Both
   are fantasies.

   This is a TANSTAAFL problem inherent in proxy
   routed traffic.

   Just because I trust your certificate to name
   you as Henning doesn't relieve me of knowing
   what you're authorized for. That means that I
   keep it in some sort of database or it needs
   to be transfered in the authentication token
   (cert, ticket). Keeping a symmetric key in that
   database as well doesn't seem to much of a
   stretch.

   So, I still don't see what you've bought
   yourself with PKI, other than lots of CPU
   cycles to do private key operations. If you
   encode the authorization into the cert you
   fall back into the same problem of realm 
   multiplicity, if you don't you've consigned 
   yourself to database lookups.

   There are two possiblities:

   1) Carry the authentication in SIP itself which runs
      into the MTU problems, naively.
   2) Carry the authentication in a separate protocol
      (such as the results of the KINK to-be-WG) and
      reuse digest authentication as the means of
      generating the keyed hash.

   I generally don't like reliance on third party
   protocols/questionable layering, but it is a
   possiblity and is somewhat inherent in both
   IPsec and TLS schemes (less so with TLS, but
   still).

I'd really prefer if no SDP content meant no change in the current media
configuration regardless of what message carried it. If a UAS wants to
terminate early media, shouldn't it send a media description with port=0 as
in any other stream removal (Section B.5)?

I haven't been following this thread in detail, so apologies if I've mssed
some key issue in the discussion.

Given the practical success of having CA's embedded in millions of web
clients, this seems at least feasible and works millions of times each
day, even though it's less than ideal if you're a new CA and want to be
recognized as such. I see no way to have a global symmetric key realm
without additional protocol support. (Even with a monster LDAP database
containing the world's users, there doesn't seem to be a way that a UAS
can verify your *digest* secret in an external database without also
obtaining a useful secret that the UAS can employ elsewhere.)

This does not mean that you couldn't use a ticket-based system (Kerberos
and kin), but we're here talking about the existing SIP authentication
mechanisms Basic, Digest and PGP (or, in the case of S/MIME, trivially
added), not something that doesn't exist yet in our context.

Shaun,

Many thanks for the information. I believe you have made the right decision.
Furthermore, for all IETF lists (PINT, SIN, SPIRITS, IPTEL) you may and should
disallow even .doc and .ppt attachments. Those who post to these lists must
follow the IETF-required practice of putting documents on their own sites and
sending only pointers via the exploders. To summarise, only text files should be
admitted to the IETF lists.

Please also feel free to impose a reasonable limit on the size of the
IETF-related e-mail messages. 

Igor

I also believe there is a strong need to differentiate the authentication of
SIP network elements (trusted devices: typically SIP UA, both UAC&UAS) and
users (in the sense of end-user or service subscriber).  

--- why?
When a VoIP gateway starts, it gets access to the network resources&services
as a trusted element in the VoIP network: the term "gateway registration"
could be used to differentiate from "end-user authentication".  Typically,
once authenticated or registered to network services, the gateway gets
access to resources like a proxy server, location server, and services like
software updates, etc.  For the VoIP network, it means the trusted gw is now
ready to originate (UAC) & terminate calls (UAS) so I can add it to my call
routing tables as a live GW.
The case of authenticating the SIP GW as a valid UAS helps to get away from
the subscriber-centric authentication.

End-user authentication is independent and it can be based on ANI, DNIS (all
calls to 1-800 from a trusted network element are ok or even all 911 calls
get through no matter what), etc.  This is the typical debit card service
case of VoIP.  The "end-user" authentication is more on a transaction basis
while the gw authentication scope can be beyond SIP transactions.

Finally, think about a network service provider in a wholesale context: the
nsp owns the network and network elements but allows other debit card
service providers to plug their debit card app.  The nsp would still want
trusted network elements.

--- how?
The realm is doable;  it would require to change the definition of realm in
2543bis ("realm: A string to be displayed to users so they know which
identity to use.")

--- various comments on the thread:

I would encourage us to use "end-user".

I disagree (see above) and also simply because the scope "gateway"
authentication is beyond a pure "SIP transaction" which is the case of "user
authentication".

Sure.  
You also have a car "registration" which allows multiple people to drive
your car and all of them have a license, right?  The car registration in
some countries proves that you have a car insurance, that your car meet some
regulatory requirements (polution for e.g.), etc.

I thought a 100 could not include a body because it's not end-to-end.
However, if I recall correctly, the RFC says an unrecognized 1xx should be
treated like a 100. However, an unrecognized 1xx should be allowed to have a
body. How about the following:

"Informational (1xx) responses (not including 100 but including unrecognized
responses) {\MAY} contain message bodies, including session descriptions."

> Later session descriptions override 
> earlier ones.

Should this say "from the same UAS" to avoid the forking issue?

> announcements
> or progress tones.  

To explain the purpose of a bidirectional stream, how about adding the
following (before the period): ", and to provide responses to assist in
creating the session".

The term "message body" might be a little vague, as there could be a
non-media-related message body.

I thought the last word in the thread was that the absence of an SDP
attachment would not affect the early media. In any case, everything after
the second comma could be removed, as it is duplicated below.

How about: 

"A provisional response without a session description has no effect on any
early media that have already been set up. A provisional response with a
session description that specifies no media (meaning the port in the "m"
line is zero)  restores normal ringback behavior."

[BTW, is it OK to refer to SDP in the main body of the RFC, or is SIP
supposed to support other media protocols as well?]

> ??? Client

Would anybody object to adding the following:

"A UAS that expects to interoperate with non-SIP endpoints {\SHOULD} be
prepared for the possibility that no media will be received from the UAC
before the INVITE transaction is complete, even when a bidirectional early
media stream has been set up."

Too many uses of the word "session". Something like "to assist in setting up
the call" would be better.

True enough. What I was trying to get at is that maybe the UAC is incapable
of sending early media, and if the UAS refuses to set up a call when it
doesn't receive any early media, the UAS may run into interoperability
problems. I suppose there is no need to mention this in the RFC.

Who is to say that this is incorrect/odd behavior. Just because a bi-directional
media stream has been established, doesn't mean that media HAS to be sent.

There are two different things here:

- trusting the information (which is what we started out from in this
gateway discussion, e.g., trusting the caller-id value). Here, it's good
enough to know that it's an AT&T gateway, say (see earlier discussion).
Whether I accept a call from that gateway is a separate matter and
something that no third party can authorize anyway. (That is, the
traditional "Cisco badge" model doesn't apply here.)

- granting authorization (should my phone ring). 

For authorization, the Basic/Digest mechanisms works, since I can hand
out user names and secrets to the very small subset of people in the
world that I want to be able to call me (at least outside certain hours
or using certain means of communication). This also works for outside
gateway access since the gateway has to have at least an indirect
business relationship with me in any event, requiring prior
establishment of trust.

See above. Again, at the danger of repeating myself, I'm talking about
things we can do today and where they might be useful. (Beyond the
do-I-trust-this-caller-id problem, public-key signed requests are also
useful for the is-this-call-really-from-the-local-gas-company problem.
Secret-based authentication, as in Basic and Digest, does nothing for me
there.)

Again, none of this addresses current capabilities and models.

i'm missing something here. with certificates, one can,
at least in theory, attempt to do path discovery/validation,
which seems to be able to do much better than "database
lookups" in trying to deal with "realm multiplicity." one can
also attempt to specify and apply policies as part of the
path validation exercise. one can't do this with older
PGP keys, but one can get an X.509 certificate for at
least some PGP keys (i haven't tried it with all the
different flavors of keys).

granted, this could chew up lots of cycles and network
time. also, there may be reasons to not want to accept
certificates from third parties, such as verisign class
one certificates, as they don't really give much authentication,
but that seems like something that could be handled by
policy in the verification path.

as to authorization issues, one could look into attribute
certificates, but that seems orthogonal to authentication
(and can't be done in a pure PGP or S/MIME context
anyway, as far as i know).

New text:

Informational (1xx) responses other than 100 (Trying) {\MAY} contain
message bodies, including session descriptions.  The session description
allows the UAC to receive special announcements or progress tones and to
provide responses to assist in creating the call (``early media'').  If
a 1xx response contains a session description, a UAC {\SHOULD} cease
generating local ringback tone.  Session description in 1xx responses
are interpreted in the same manner as those in 2xx responses.  Later
session descriptions from the same UAS override earlier ones.  The UAS  
can remove the media stream by setting the port number to zero in a
subsequent session description contained in a provisional response and
thus restore normal ringback behavior.  A provisional response without a
session description has no effect on any early media that have already
been set up.

The media streams are assumed to be bidirectional unless marked as
send-only or receive-only.  For SDP, this is described in
Section~\ref{sec:sdp}.  Client behavior when receiving several different
session descriptions from different branches is undefined.

Nobody can require that I send media for anything, so I'm not sure this
is particularly special or helpful.

I think "override" is not well specified enough. We have defined rules
that make it clear what it means for A to send B an SDP, and then for B
to send an SDP back to A in such a way that we can correlate things. I
believe we must stick with that behavior by somehow mapping the sequence
of SDP we can see into this two phase process. 

So, I would propose that:

1. SDP returned in a provisional MUST be formatted in such a way that it
would be valid if it were returned in a 200 instead, 
2. If an SDP is returned in one provisional response, and then a later
provisional response contains SDP, this new SDP is treated as if it were
the original response to the SDP in the INVITE. 
3. The SDP in the 200 response is also treated as if it were the one and
only SDP received from the UAS, along the same lines as (2).

Note that this has some implications, particularly, you cannot add a
media stream from one 183 to the next.

Some other interactions to consider. We allow the INVITE to not contain
SDP, and then the 200 and ACK both contain SDP (again, everything must
be mapped to the rules for this two-phase SDP exchange). In this case,
can a 183 be sent with SDP if there was no SDP in the INVITE? I would
assume yes, but if, and only if, PRACK is used, and the PRACK contains
SDP (this way, the two phase exchange is 183/PRACK). Now, if there are
subsequent 183, each with SDP, those 183 COULD do things like add media
streams, as they represent the initial SDP in the two phase process.

Now, that raises another issue. If the original INVITE does contain SDP,
and then the 183 contains SDP, can the PRACK contain SDP? I say no -
same reason you shouldn't have SDP in the INVITE, OK and ACK.

Comments?

imho when we discuss sip extensions, it is the classical case of inheritance
vs. encapsulation. do we extend sip with more request types rather than
reuse the existing ones?

let me stick my neck out and say this ... protocols that were endlessly
extended have never succeeded. look at tcp/ip, how many different types of
headers does it have? (is it three or four?). how many types of requests
does HTTP have? do they have different requests for different types of
services and web-sites? Did we have to change the email protocol to create
the web based email? (SMTP remained SMTP all along, and will do so for a
long time to come).

I guess that when we talk of extending a protocol, we should first examine,
if it is not possible to implement the functionality within the existing
mechanisms.
I would like to see services being build on top of sip rather than within.
For instance, MESSAGE can be used (in comibination with authenication
schemes already in place) for online payments. A session of MESSAGE
exchanges should be terminable with a BYE.
If a MESSAGE no with body can be used to query presence, use it.

I guess that we are talking of a lot many things that one would like to see
being implemented and this list will never end. We need a protocol that is
small and flexible and not one which will spawn such a large variety of
variations that it willl become impossible to implement it all in a
reasonable space. (The voida stack requires 256 MB of memory to compile. I
will have to wait for that venture cap funding to arrive before I can afford
to compile it).

The issue of optimal implementation is not as important as simplicity. many
of the issues that we are engaging in may not be a very big deal in the
coming times.
for instance, authentication. the best authentication of an incoming call
is, ofcourse, the caller's voice recognition and not the digital id. (how
many digital ids will i feed into my
sip-mobile-phone-cum-palm-electric-shaver?)
i also believe that internet realtime sessions will evolve and spread just
like email did about 7-8 years ago. the calling costs will drop to zero. it
is only a bandwidth issue from here onwards. therefore, payments,
authentications will be as useful as they are for email users and email
service providers.

this brings me to a fairly controversial subject (of endless debate with my
colleagues in 'suits') that there will be as much money to be made in
internet telephony as there is in email. there will be money mostly ip
telephony hardware. not much in software.

Sounds great. We should also clarify the difference between 180 & 183 with
SDP. For instance specifying explicitly which response code should be used
for remote ringback during user alerting (180 seems to be the winner) verse
non-user alerting progress tones (183).

Cheers,

Robert.

I would hope that we keep this early media business limited to where it
is absolutely needed (old telephony interworking where charging is
involved), so allowing to add media, modify media and so on seem to go
down a path of complexity that isn't warranted by the application and
only further muddies the SIP session model.  For more complicated
scenarios where there are different logical sources of media during a
session, it seems that a regular INVITE/200 and then REFER or re-INVITE
is much cleaner. (I'm not arguing that Jonathan wants to go there, just
that I think there's a danger of making what started to be an innocent
little feature into a complexity nightmare. Thus, anything that
restricts behavior is good for me.)

Since PRACK isn't in 2543bis, this needs to be worded more generically.
Also, this would have to be described in the 100rel draft.

Do we really want to go there?

Yes, again to keep it (kind of) simple.

As a matter of fact, all of these protocols have seen a number of
extensions over the years. HTTP, for example, in WebDAV, SMTP in the
ESMTP verbs and TCP in various TCP option extensions. The mechanism
differs, but the idea is the same.

I am a confused newbie, and I want to understand the relationship between 
the contemplated SIP standard, and the contemplated IMPP standard.

IMPP seems to do the same thing as SIP.  If you want to send an instant 
message, make a phone call, send a video message, hold a video 
conversation, you log on to Microsoft's PP server using Microsoft's PP 
client and do it.

I get the impression that both standards are having some difficulty in 
becoming standard:

To me in my ignorance it seems that SIP has 101 contemplated extensions to 
do anything whatsoever in any way related to communication, whereas the 
IMPP standard appears to be entirely ignored by the people that are 
actually implementing IMPP.  SIP seems like the early Somalian peace 
conference, where they wound up agreeing to disagree, and IMPP seems like 
the later Somalian peace conference, where they agreed on a government for 
Somalia, but the government was unable to get into Somalia.

>IMPP seems to do the same thing as SIP.
This is very true. On the SIP infrastructure (server and
gateways), no extra work is required to support IM. The
advantages of integration go however beyond using the common
communications infrastructure, new applications, instant
communications become possible.

Henning,

Try this one:

count those backslashes (their an odd number).  Anything but a turing
machine will have difficulty with this one.  Most simple regular
expressions will hack the body off between `Subject' and `folded'.

I agree with you 100% on this one. I have been preaching the above truth
for years now.

No doubt there are a lot; we (and myself in particular) are actively
trying to curtail the amount of random extensions being proposed. But,
fact is that interactive communications is a hard problem, and theres
lots of stuff that needs to be done.

SIP itself is a standard (rfc2543), and the baseline spec is widely
implemented and supported by service providers and vendors.

Well, the problem is that there is no IMPP standard. Nearly every
service provider and IM and presence software manufacturer has said they
will support the IMPP working group's protocol when it materializes.
However, the lack of progress and consensus within this group have
caused many to go down other routes (IMUnified).

Err, no. IMPP the working group has undoubtedly agreed to disagree (in
fact, this is formally codified in an Internet Draft). The SIP working
group generally agrees and there is consensus; there is just a ton of
stuff being proposed. Not sure what peace conference to equate that to.

You are confusing protocol syntax with semantics. You are arguing to
reuse syntax to express NEW semantics. MESSAGE right now doesn't make
online payments, nor does it query presence or turn on the toaster. You
have just as much work to do to get sip to do online payments if you use
a new method or "reuse" an old one.

(trimming sip-implementors from the cc list)

As with many of our security discussions, I think we've gotten a bit off
track. The problem is very spceific; does proxy (and UA) authentication
actually authenticate the originating device, or the user of that
device. Seems like there were valid reasons to authenticate the user and
the device for both proxy and regular (401) authentication. Henning's
example of trusting the caller-ID on the gateway is a good one.

So, given that we need both, we have an ambiguity in the spec which we
must resolve. WHich one is implied by the current authentication
mechanisms (user, I would assume), and how would we specify that the
other is what is desired? Should we impose some structure on the ream to
indicate this, so that:

realm="device:MyRealm"

indicates that device authentication is desired for that specific realm?

Hi Neil,

   Thank you for correcting the example from the typos I made
   and for pushing this discussion forwards.

> Rather than just kick this around for a bit and drop it
> without consensus it would be nice to reach closure.
> 
> How about we just don't do loop detection
> if there is a Route: to follow. Has anyone got a
> good reason not to take this simple approach?

   Yes, that's what I have been trying to express in some
   of my previous postings to this discussion. But maybe
   it has been lost in all the typos I've made, and maybe
   also in my not-so-good english ;)

   The suggestion of not doing loop detection if there is
   a Route will probably solve that specific problem. 

   Previously on this list there was a discussion on loops 
   vs. spirals and then it was solved was making a cryptographic 
   hash of Request-URI + call leg data when generating the branch
   value for the Via field and that approach solved that
   specific problem.

   But I believe, that the problem is of more general nature,
   and I think making "fixes" in the protocol such as the branch
   value solution for loops/spirals and this new solution with 
   not doing loop detection if there is a Route, will add more
   complexity than needed and anyway not solve the general
   problem.

   The thing that needs to be recognized, or at least I think
   so (maybe it's wrong, just tell me so if it is) is that
   proxies (at least stateful ones) needs a concept of 
   "transaction identifier", being the call leg + the requestURI,
   in order to be able to separate different transactions
   with the same call leg through the same proxy . One example
   of that is the spiral case. Another example is when you have
   a proxy, p1, forking a request to several different users at
   another proxy, p2. In p2, you will need to use the request-
   URI + the call leg to be able to separate the transactions.
   (p1 & p2 are stateful in this example). 

   If this will be recognized, you may not need solutions like
   the branch value of today, like not doing loop detection
   when having Route, and similar.

   If you recognize this concept, and adapt what needs to be
   adapted to support it (for example not changing the request-URI
   when the called UA are creating the Route), I think you
   will end up with a more simple solution than the ones suggested
   today.

		Hi,

		Am I right if I consider that in case of an INVITE sent by a User Agent Client
		the transaction is from INVITE until ACK (instead of INVITE/200OK as defined
		in the RFC2543) ?

		Thanks,
		J. Blanchard

   I don't think this is a good idea. If a SIP
   UA, say, gets challenged to authenticate in
   a particular realm, it should first check if
   it knows how to authenticate to that realm
   directly (ie, has the password, etc). If it
   does, then it provides the authentication
   proof. If it doesn't then it needs to pop it
   up to the user who initiated the call and they
   get to figure it out. 

   As such, I see no motivation for drawing a 
   distinction between "devices" and "users".
   What I think *is* clear is that an INVITE
   may traverse multiple different authentication
   challenge points. However this has nothing to
   do with a user/device false dichotomy. I,
   mat@cisco.com, may very well be challenged to
   enter an acct#/PIN for my Telephant.com (:-) 
   calling card and then again challenged to
   listen to my SIP voice mailbox at cisco
   all in the same proxy-routed INVITE. This
   implies that you need to ship multiple
   credentials each time, but as far as I can
   tell, that's legal SIP.

At this point we should probably agree to disagree.

We'll just have to disagree on this point (especially on the importance of 
a human user participating -- I believe most applications are "agents" for 
users).

I agree that they should have means for supporting unknown methods, but I 
don't think I can count on all implementations being as good as yours.

In the context of SIP for Appliances I would enjoy setting up a meeting 
with you and other interested parties to discuss the best way to use SIP 
(e.g., new methods or re-use of existing methods -- though I know your 
position on that, but I'm sure there are other issues).

Do you mean protocol semantics or application semantics? Because I do 
believe that the application semantics are different, but at the protocol 
level there is essentially no difference in semantics of MESSAGE for 
Instant Messaging or MESSAGE for online payments (or turning on a toaster) 
-- you're just sending a "payment" message to an application instead of a 
text message to a human user.

Also, I think it is less work to re-use an old method than to create a new 
one. If you re-use an existing method you can use existing SIP Proxies and 
UA stacks you only need to modify the application(s) to handle different 
payload types.

As I have stated countless times now, I strongly disagree. I really
didn't want to make this an open invitation to reopen this debate, but,
since you insist...

Clearly, MESSAGE was a bad method name to use. MESSAGE does not mean
message in the RPC sense. It does not mean "take this and pass it up to
the application layer for processing". The protocol semantics of MESSAGE
are very clear and very simple: render this content for the purposes of
display to some user or their agent as part of a text based interactive
conversation. That is simply not the same as make an online transaction.

Let me put it this way - do you argue we should ditch INVITE? Isn't that
just a message to the other side with some content that describes a
session? Are you proposing we deprecate INVITE and use MESSAGE for that
too?

Oh?

Wrong.

Proxies are supposed to forward method independent. Ours does. Any proxy
that doesn't is defective and you should send it back.

As for UA stacks, they should also have a means to support unknown
methods. Ours does; you can register handlers for any method name. Same
reason a stack should support unknown body types. Why is it more likely
one is supported as opposed to the other?

we cannot trash the INVITE method because the INVITE is a three way
handshake (much like the TCP) that is essential for a complete, reliable
session intiation as opposed to MESSAGE which doesnt require any further
handshake from the other side. Nor can we trash BYE and CANCEL. They all
have different effects on the sip stack's state itself. While MESSAGE,
NOTIFY, SUBSCRIBE, etc. have essential the same effect.

>Proxies are supposed to forward method independent. Ours does. Any proxy

A proxy has to be aware of the nature of the method. An INVITE will fork, an
ACK will not. A single NOTIFY to a proxy can be forwarded to multiple
SUBSCRIBErs, an MESSAGE is unicasted. Thus, each method needs its own
special processing (if the proxy is anything over a trivial implementation).

maybe i haven't been able to articulate myself well enough, what i am saying
it that we should try building over and outside the sip stack instead of
building it within.

i am essentially asking for a freeze on the number of request methods. this
is important to keep the stack size down and managable. the example of using
MESSAGE to querying for presence wasn't correct. Let me give a better
example:

"A service on the net wherein you can make a sip call, enter your PIN and
listen to any updates on your stock portfolio on your computer."

This can be accomplished using Authorisation schemes to login to the stock
quotes server (because the UAS will challenge the UAC), then the UAS sends a
MESSAGE to UAC asking for the PIN. On receiving the PIN, in another message,
the UAS starts streaming the stock market commentary to the UAC.

What I am arguing is that the sipstack itself does not need to be aware of
the nature of service it is being used for. It is easy to build this service
such that it doesn't need a specialised UAC either. That is extremely
important. If you look at the issue from an end-user perspective, a single
universal client should be able to handle all types of realtime session
services through a simple common protocol. I can't imagine that being
anything other than SIP.

When we do speak of a general purpose user agent, then it should have a well
defined number of methods that can handle a large amount innovative services
developed over the SIP stack. If we insist that different users download a
whole lot of different versions of SIP UACs for different applications, it
will be like having a different web browser for every site.

Thus, I am arguing that a web browser is not aware of how google.com works.
similarly, a SIP UAC need not be bothered about what the UAS is all about.

Although it is not directly related to SIP in itself, there is an  issue of
the presentation layer too: It is an important goal that through a generic
UAC much like the email UAC, we are able to initiate any multimedia session
that the user is capable of handling (has the codecs, bandwidth and
processing power). For this, it is essential that a UAC understands and
implements the SIP protocol largley and not minimally.

the application level intelligence for SIP sessions should be handled
between the user agents themselves.

on a personal note, I am trying to develop very small footprint SIP stacks.
It is also important for developers like me and biggs that the sip stack be
prevented from growing so big that we will realistically miss out on large
chunks of functionality. the large size of vovida stack is an indicator of
the way implementations are going.
By keeping the SIP stack small, I am not saying that we will put it on pin
heads! we will be able to spread it to more desktops faster (I can send you
a small sip client in email!) or make it downloadable on the web within
seconds. These are important goals for fast, viral spread of SIP. They also
need a small, compact and functionaly complete SIP stack that doesn't have
to be upgraded (I can't change my ipphones as often as I can change my
browsers). SIP stack is going to a lot of inaccessible places that may not
be upgradable. SIP stack is also going to places that need exteremly
reliable performance (like wireless ip telephony base stations) - it will be
very expensive to re-implement and test and re-deploy newer and ever
expanding versions of SIP.

I'll repeat my question, since the answer matters greatly: are you
talking about Basic/Digest or PGP authentication? 

Since that's what's implemented, I'm assuming Basic/Digest for now.

With Basic/Digest, it only matters what name(s) and associated secrets
the receiving proxy recognizes. If it recognizs gateway:spoiled-milk for
all request-URIs, that's fine, but it's not clear what establishing a
canonical user name, realm or password accomplishes.

In any event, the secret has to be hard-configured for each gateway. For
the proxy and UA case,

sip:1234@proxy.com
...realm="foo"
and
sip:456@proxy.com
...realm="foo"

are different protection spaces.

As a guide to implementors, it may be useful to indicate that if you
don't care about different authentications for different request-URIs,
it makes sense to establish a "global" user name/password/realm that's
the default challenge if a particular user name doesn't have its own
realm or set of user names. Similarly, gateways may want to try their
global user name and secret when challenged.

I don't think this phrasing helps. Basic/Digest authentication assures,
for a particular request-URI on that proxy, that the requestor has one
of possibly several valid name/secret combination. If the proxy or UA
allows the same user for all request-URIs, it's effectively an
authentication for the 'device'. (This assumes, for example, that the
per-number cgi scripts running on the server are trustworthy. With basic
authentication, a script could easily get the secret and then create a
fake call for any phone number on that server.)

This document looks good. However, being new to this mailing list, I have a
fundamental
question. Why was it chosen to support a call control protocol like SIP over
an unreliable
transport protocol like UDP. HTTP, on which SIP is based, works over a
reliable transport,
all call control protocols in the PSTN world, like SS7, Q.931 etc. work over
a reliable
transport. This draft <draft-ietf-sip-100rel-02.txt> and several parts of
SIP specification
seem to exist because of the need to make SIP work over an unreliable
transport protocol.

Regards,
Sivaram.

Does PRACK have a way of refusing to change an existing media stream to a
new media type (i.e., in response to a second 1xx after a media stream has
already been set up)? If not, then how far can the analogy with re-INVITEs
be pushed?

Maybe I was too quick to concede the point. Another way of looking at it is
that if I am writing a gateway, and I see that SIP allows bidirectional
early media streams, I may be wondering how I should handle such requests.
Assume that the PSTN protocol allows only one-way early media; then there
are two choices:
1. When the 183 is received, set up a send-only media stream, regardless of
whether two-way media are requested.
2. Connect the call early on the PSTN side, to allow the two-way media
stream to be set up (perhaps causing problems with billing).
I believe the correct choice is the first one; I am wondering if the RFC
should give guidance on this issue.

I think this is a gross overgeneralization. Furthermore, I think you'll 
find that stacks such as Vovida's and others provide a great
deal more functionality above and beyond what a bare bones SIP stack might.
If you're application does not require this level of functionality, you
may save something by using a smaller stack. If however your application
does require this level of functionality, you will probably find this
approach appealing. I do not think you will find a one-size-fits-all
SIP stack just as you won't find a one-size-fits-all HTTP server.

That being said, I do believe it is possible to build a compact SIP stack.
It is just a question of what tradeoffs you are willing to make.

I have come across a inconsistency in Table 2 regarding the password
parameter. Table 2 states that the password is not allowed in the From
header. But the comparison rules for the sip URL state in the third bullet
that the "user, password, host, port and any url-parameters of the URI must
match."

Based on these it seems to me that the From and To headers both need to
allow the same parameters or context matching will fail at the User Agent. 

I would suggest that Table 2 be modified to optionally include password in
the From.

i am in total agreement with sean that we do need complete stacks. we need
reference implementations that do everything in the book. vovida's stack is
ofcourse a case in point. so is the excellent stack of dynamicsoft.com is
the 'taj mahal' of sip stacks - it is beautiful.

i am also convinced that there is never going to be the one and only true
stack. different platforms, different architectures and needs will drive how
big ever a stack is going to be. sean correctly points out that from apache
server to a small server stuffed into a PIC chip, it is possible to
implement the http protocol anywhere. But it is illuminating to note that
even the smallest of tcp or http stacks are fully functional without any
tradeoffs of functionality. There are only tradeoffs of scalability and
performance.

sean also said that -
 >That being said, I do believe it is possible to build a compact SIP stack.
>It is just a question of what tradeoffs you are willing to make.

the only tradeoff i am willing to make is in terms of performance, not
functionality. a good protocol will allow you to implement itself as simply
or as optimally as you like. I have seen completely functional tcp stacks
written in less than 2000 lines of code. students have written email UAs
with a few hundred lines of code. I am arguing that sip protocol should also
be the same. implement it in 1000 lines or in 1 million. It is the
implementor's call.

my finaly argument for smaller stacks is not scientific in nature. it is
just that huge stacks are not "simply profound". even though they maybe
inefficient, it is always an excellent engineering decision to not
over-engineer a protocol and leave it 80% OK.

if you take a darwinian perspective on the survival of the best protocols,
often enough, brilliantly designed protocols have often given way to simpler
and easier to work with protocols. SGML never took off the way HTML did.
Microsoft's DCOM failed where SOAP is succeeding.

- farhan

- farhan.

let's be clear that there isn't 'a' stack but probably two stacks that we
are really looking at. the UA stack and the proxy stack. I am convinced that
the proxy stacks ought to be strong and big. I am convinced that the UA
stacks ought to be small and light. (compare sendmail with elm).
the tradeoffs

I put the media on hold where necessary, so that flows are happening on just

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I assume you are talking about =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believe now</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that this function is quite a =
complex one and something that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; merits much</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more discussion</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before deciding if its =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure folks will want to do things =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; All these features require a way to =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; window, whatever) associated with the =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Known call-id.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think this is =
sufficient.&nbsp; First, I think the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; existing call-id is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; better suited for replacement of call =
legs as described above.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Second, from the definition of call, =
conference, session, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; call-id in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the bis draft, I have always =
interpreted this to mean that if</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; A calls B,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; and B calls C, if you join these two =
calls together, they</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; need to keep</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; unique call ids.&nbsp; Neither call =
was invited by a common</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; source, and neither</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; call necessarily has or will use the =
same session description.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the bis draft:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Call: A call consists of all =
participants in a conference</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; invited by a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;common source. A SIP call is =
identified by a globally </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; unique call-id</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(Section 6.12). Thus, if a user =
is, for example, invited </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to the same</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;multicast session by several =
people, each of these</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; invitations will be a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;unique call. A point-to-point =
Internet telephony</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation maps into a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;single SIP call. In a multiparty =
conference unit (MCU) </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; based call-in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;conference, each participant uses =
a separate call to invite</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; himself to the MCU.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Conference: A multimedia session =
(see below), identified </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; by a common</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;session description. A conference =
can have zero or more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; members and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;includes the cases of a multicast =
conference, a full-mesh</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; confer-ence and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a two-party &quot;telephone =
call&quot;, as well as combinations of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; these. Any number</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of calls can be used to create a =
conference.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; We need a way to semantically link =
multiple calls with</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; distinct call-ids.</FONT>

There were several reasons:

1. to improve the call setup times, which are an issue,
2. to enable highly scalable stateless proxies, which are used
extensively and are not possible with TCP,
3. to support low end phones for which tcp implementations can be an
issue 
4. to support intermittently connected devices for which tcp connections
are not ideal
5. to improve fault tolerance and provide the capability of hot
standby's and failovers; this is related to  (2), since this is possible
with stateless proxies.

In any case, the decision has long ago been made and widely implemented
(far more than tcp, in fact). 

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Well, that depends on what you wish to call "the stack". According to
the IM and presence drafts, a very specific set of processing is defined
for SUBSCRIBE and I promise you it is not the same as the processing of
MESSAGE. Are these above the baseline rfc2543 processing definitions?
Yes. But, that does not mean they should all be funneled in one method.

Lets put it in software terms. Lets say I have an API to some library,
and this library has callbacks. We have two events, foo and bar, which
pass some data. You could define the API in two ways:

public interface callback {
  public void foo(int data);
  public void bar(int data);
}

OR

public interface callback {
  public void event(int data, boolean isFoo);
}


now, you need the SAME AMOUNT OF CODE either way to demuliplex; the
question is: where is the right place for it? Should we combine logic
with data, or keep them separate? Good programming style, IMHO, would
argue for keeping them separate and defining functions that are explicit
in what they do. This speaks to the first interface above, not the
second, which quickly becomes a programming nightmare as the set of
events increases.

The parallel in SIP is obvious; method is a method in the programming
sense of the word - it defines a very concrete operation to be performed
on the server (not the stack); all the data in the message merely
qualifies that operation, it does not define it.

You are incorrect. INVITE has a well-defined semantic, as do ACK and
CANCEL. Everything else (in terms of proxy processing) is the same as
OPTIONS. That includes BYE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, etc.

We should build well defined but general purpose operations into SIP
(like REFER) which can be used to build many services. No disagreement
there. But that is NOT the same thing as simply reusing a method instead
of defining a new, when the semantics are not the same. It is hard to
write code for SIP if the basic processing of a method depends on
umpteen different headers and bodies.

Slightly better is that the MESSAGE contains an http url for a form for
entering the PIN. Doing so is a perfectly good thing to do.

I'm not disagreing with this. I'm disagreeing with assuming that by
placing a completely new function within an existing method, that
*shazam* - its for free!

I agree here too.

Why? I actually know of phones that can fetch a new image when one is
available without any human interaction at all. I'm not arguing that as
an excuse for a fat stack, mind you, but I don't see why upgrading an ip
phone is different than a browser. Probably easier since the IP phone is
way thinner than a browser.

It seems to me that the more general problem is that the existing 
certificate structure is designed to prove that Telephant Telecom is the 
real Telephant Telecom , rightful owner of various cheque accounts and 
credit cards, an entity capable of being sued.  Ultimately, it is designed 
to facilitate shopping and contracts.

It appears to me that the goal of encryption in SIP is not to enable 
shopping and contracts, but merely to prove that when you are communicating 
with Joe97@hotmail.com you are communicating with someone who knows the 
password to log on to the account Joe97@hotmail.com, and only that someone.

If our system has to know that Joe97@hotmail.com is the real Telephant 
Telecom, in order to prevent someone from listening in to his sex chat, we 
have problems.

If everyone in the system has to know that Joe97@hotmail.com is the real 
Telephant Telecom, we have really big problems.

Sometimes Joe97 might want to prove he was the real Telephant Telecom for 
some reason, but most of the time the software merely wants to know he is 
the real Joe97, and does not want to deal with the burden of an additional 
mapping between SIP identities and authenticated true names.

Hi,

   Consider this theoretical fork tree example (I've tried to use 
   some kind of generic URI notation for the nodes in the
   tree):


                                u0@p0
                                  |
                   --------------------------------
                   |                              |
                u11@p11                        u12@p12
                   |                              |
           -----------------              -----------------
           |               |              |               |
        u21@p21         u22@p22        u23@p23         u24@p24
           |               |              |               |
      ---------       ---------       ---------       ---------
      |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
   u31@p31 u32@p32 u33@p33 u34@p34 u35@p35 u36@p36 u37@p37 u38@p38

   

   This is just a limited example, and could be more generalized,
   but I think it will do for this discussion.

   Theoretically, a proxy X could occupy any number of combinations
   of nodes in this tree, from 0 to all. (For example it could be
   X == p0 == p21 == p23 == p34 when forwarding a request through
   the tree). For most of these combinations you would want to keep 
   the transactions separated from eachother, being a stateful proxy. 
   The spiral case which was previously discussed in this list is 
   merely a subset of combinations in such a theoretical "forwarding
tree".

   Implementing the proxy X, and given the way the SIP spec is written
   today, I don't know of a way to separate the transactions within
   proxy X. 

   I would greatly appreciate if anybody in the SIP community,
   knowing of a solution to this that could be implemented
   today, could send a posting to this discussion. 

   Otherwise it can be considered as a real problem for the whole
   community - it is simply impossible to implement a real stateful 
   SIP server product today, existing in larger networks.

   In that case a suggestion is to make it possible to use the call 
   leg + cseq + information extracted from/based on the requestURI
   to be able to identify the transactions within a proxy.

   However, the way Route is designed today, original
   request-URI information from Record-Route path is destroyed 
   for some higher purpose that I haven't been able to understand.

   I would like the original request-URI information from
   Record-Route to be kept in the Route, because then I would
   be able to use request-URI information together with call leg & 
   cseq to identify transactions.
   
   The simplicity of the proxy operation, when being able to
   identify transactions in this suggested manner, is rather appealing 
   to me at least. Given this opportunity, other things in SIP could
   be simplified as well. For example the hash part of the
   branch values for the Via could probably be removed, saving 
   considerably more bytes than the short form of SIP ;) ;) when 
   the requests are forwarded a number of times.

   Of course there are a number of alternative solutions, a new
   header could be invented, or whatever. But if this is a problem,
   at least something needs to be done.

   I do realize that this is a theoretical discussion and the some 
   of these combinations are highly unlikely to happen in a "real" 
   network, but as SIP network structures start to build, one could 
   easily predict that many "unlikely" cases will occur.

   If this will be recognized by others as a problem, I would like
   to emphasize the benefit of finding one rather simple solution
   that would solve the general problem, rather than to invent
   a number of "fixes" in the protocol to solve a number of "special
   cases" of the general problem.

This is not exactly true. Any new method is completely transparent to
proxies; proxies don't need to "support" MESSAGE, INFO or
YOUR-PERSONAL-METHOD. Good UA libraries should allow sending new
non-INVITE methods - after all, beyond the method name, they are all the
same in terms of lower-level support such as reliability or associating
requests and responses.

This is bogus. The small TCP stacks, SMTP and HTTP are *not* the same as
the large ones. Small TCP stacks don't, for example, implement many of
the extensions such as window scaling or selective acknowledgements and
may make other short cuts. Same for HTTP, in terms of support for
caching, range retrievals, authentication or content negotiation, among
many other features contained in HTTP/1.1. Building a minimal SIP (UA)
stack is certainly possible in less than 1000 lines, judging from the
homework assignments I get back in one of my classes.

I don't know what it would mean to have a password parameter in From, so
it's probably better to qualify the comparison rule to indicate that
parameters that are not there match. (Although I find this kind of
obvious...)

In an attempt at closure on this (or has it already been closed ?) as
it is a little point and we could spend our time better on other stuff
i suggest some simple text as follows:

P. 119 (End of C.1):

-----


The backslash character ("\") MAY be used as a single-character quoting
mechanism only within quoted-string and comment constructs. NOTE the
characters "\r" and "\n" cannot be escaped by this mechanism so as not
to conflict with line folding and header separation.

quoted-pair =  "\" (0x00 - 0x09 | 0x0b | 0x0c | 0x0e - 0x7f)


-----

This will (hopefully) spell it out for any new comers to this problem
without them having to trall through other rfc's or for this thread in
the mailing list archives.

This is trivially solved (for the example above) with the notion
of "Isomorphic Requests" as defined in the spec.  Basically,
every request that differs in at least one of From, To, Call-ID,
CSeq, Request-URI or topmost-Via from any other request, indicates
a distinct transaction.

I would note that the spec doesn't mention anything about looking
at the topmost-Via at this point, this should probably be fixed?

As above.

I finally think I'm with you. &:)

Let's consider the following:
  A -INV-> P1 -INV-> P2 -INV-> P1 -INV-> B

A is originating UA, B is receiving UA, P1 & P2 are proxies that
Record-Route.

Let's say that a call is successfully set up.  Now B wants to
hang-up.  We've been discussing what the Route will look like
for the BYE, and currently the "consensus" is that P1 can appear
twice with impunity; proxies don't loop-detect when Route headers
are present.

Okay, fine, but when the P2-P1 "portion" of the BYE reaches P1,
how will it distinguish that request from the initial B-P1
"portion"?  "Easy!"  I hear you cry, "We'll just look at the topmost
Via."  Okay, but I already detected this as a Request-Merge, and
returned a 482.

So now we also say that you don't do Request-Merge Detection or
Loop Detection when there are Route headers present.  This does
not help, since if we update the scenario to be:
  A -INV-> P1 -INV-> P2 -INV-> P1 -INV-> P2 -INV-> B
We can no-longer guarantee that P1 will see different topmost-Vias.

Now there are a couple of hacks around this:
 1) We could start to count Vias.  This has been brought up in
    relation to Loop Detection in the face of Via hiding.
 2) We could make extra requirements on the branch parameter
    such that it would always be different in these cases.
    (Note that this will still mean we would have to ignore
    Request-Merging with Route headers present.  Although I
    admit it's slightly difficult to see how such a situation
    would ever occur. (:&)
 3) We could mandate that proxies are allowed to add themselves
    into a Record-Route path _at most once_.

I prefer 3), mainly because of it's simplicity from a protocol
perspective, and also because I haven't heard a good argument
why it's harmful.  Sure, it's going to require a small amount
of extra complexity in transaction-handling in proxies, but I
can't see that it's going to be so difficult to work around.

I still don't buy this.  I agree with Johnathan that it makes
the protocol more "brittle".  Request-URI has a very well-defined
meaning, and that meaning is completely lost if we take this
approach.

No, we can never remove the requirement that the branch parameter
is a function of the Request-URI.  If we do that, it becomes
impossible to detect loops.

I vote for 3).  I'll be distributing badges shortly. &:)

I tried to give you an example with a proxy with a local
network on one side and an wider network on the other side.
I don't know if it's a good example, but anyway the "3" solution
wouldn't work there.

Or ???

Also, if you remember, Jonathan didn't like it because a
proxy implementing services and stuff might want to keep
the transactions apart.

I think, when routing using Route, the request-URI is
merely an illusion as far as routing concerns. Look at
how the Via works when routing responses. It's not brittle 
at all ;)

I don't mean that we could remove the branch parameter,
I am talking about the hash part (1.21323454556667), ie all
the digits after the dot. Don't bother to count them, I just
pressed down a lot of digits simultaneously on my keyboard :)

Instead we could just use 1, 2, 3, ... as branch values, still 
being able to detect loops.

If we use the request-URI (as I suggested) to find the correct 
transaction handler/transaction data in the proxy, spirals are 
treated correctly automatically since they trigger different
transaction handlers/or represent different transaction data.
We wouldn't need the hash part of the branch values.

Ah yes.  I had forgotten about that problem, but I seem to remember
that it only solved a small part of a general difficulty when one
starts to look at firewalls.

Yes.  Fair enough, but I haven't seen an argument yet why the
proxy can't maintain a 1-to-many map internally.

Agreed, the Request-URI isn't being used at all.  I guess I just
feel more secure knowing it's there and it's right.  (Well,
almost.)

Yes, but those digits still have to be a function of the branch
parameter somehow.  Index into an array &:) or whatever.  I don't
see how this changes anything.  (We have an implementation now
that does loop detection and detects request merging scenarios
and can spiral, and the branch parameter is basically a
monotonically increasing integer.)

In an incoming request, the branch parameter in the topmost Via
is generally going to be meaningless insofar as locating the
correct "transaction" in a proxy (well, you need it in perverse
request-merging situations).  You do, however, need to look
down the list of Vias, and look for a "familiar" branch parameter.
That's the important bit.

Anyway, Neil has got me all turned around on the issue.  I'm now
thinking perhaps 2), since the added restriction of not doing
loop detection (request merging) checks on requests with Route
headers in isn't that Draconian, and it also solves another problem
that I've been harping on about: Loop Detection and Via Hiding
(see "thread" from last week).  That is, add the requirement that
branch parameters are always unique (within some reasonable
time-frame).

[Everbody please change their badges to say "2" instead of "3". (:&]

Thoughts?

Cheers,


 - Jo.

i have lost an earlier draft of my posting. maybe it never got posted.
anyway, here it goes again:

this is absolutely the way to go. one method ought to do just one thing
completely. i am completely convinced that each method ought to do just one
thing. we cannot have another ioctl() horror on the sip stack.

If SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, MESSAGE, BYE are all the same, evidently their
interpretation is completely between the user agents themselves. In that
sense they are a recommendation of how SIP can be applied to add more
functionality. Much like SIP is encapsulated in UDP, we are encapsulating
more methods within the SIP architecture. To that extent, the interpretation
of SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, MESSAGE, etc. is  the problem of the recepient of the
requests.

>I don't see why upgrading an ip

one simple way to upgrade an ip phone is by rom replacement. online
upgrading has its own interesting possiblities. someone with a rogue
bluetooth on his palm can just walk around an office and download a trick
stack into all the ipphones (maybe this is just science fiction). But the
very interesting possiblities that it _does_ open up is that if we can
incorporate downloading of  'siplets' to SIP devices that run like applets
in secure sandboxes, we can come up with some pretty interesting
applications.

i imagine that such ip phones will also need a mechanism to download and
invoke method handlers. possibly a siplet specification in the body of the r
equest? if so, do we give provisional responses until the download is
complete ? what are the security managment issues involved with siplets?
this is an exciting possiblity. shall we try implementing something like on
a desktop UA that can download the request handlers.

the other approach will be to dish out everything from some sort of a
telephony application server that manages a number of sip phones (a proxy).
the added services are all build on the proxy server side. this keeps the
UAs themselves fixed and small. this is an approach that we took when we
designed hotfoon.com.

hotfoon.com - dumb VoiP terminals

hotfoon.com used a very simplistic protocol that transfered what ever a user
type to the server (raw) and whatever the server dished out directly to a
display window on the UA. Apart from the text messaging, just a single
call-setup/cleardown message pair was used to implement the session
initiation protocol. All the logic, including the call state was maintained
on the server side. the huge advantage was that it required virtually no
upgrades at all (the client is just a 48kb download including gsm codec). we
added features as the users demanded them. Someone asked for queues and we
implemented them, some asked for chat, we gave it to them. The idea was that
a simple VoiP client could be scaled up with innumerable features without
having to upgrade the clients themselves. Like all simplistic
implementations, it suffered on account of scalability (the servers were
stateful and had to deal with a lot  of concurrency issues). Nevertheless,
it still does handle hundreds of active users.

The idea explored in hotfoon.com was to implement dumb voip terminals,
wherein the intelligence was centralised (as different from sip where the
intelligence is towards the edge) in moderately powered telephony
application servers. it is still an interesting thing to toy around with.

This is my preference. This gives Loita the desired property - you can
uniquely identify the transaction as a concatenation of a finite set of
fields - To, From, R-URI, Call-ID, CSeq, top via (plus branch-ID). Jo
pointed out in a previous note that:

> I would note that the spec doesn't mention anything about looking
> at the topmost-Via at this point, this should probably be fixed?
> 

Yes, it should. 

An interesting wrinkle I just thought of - stateless proxies. They need
to be sure that the branch-ID they insert is unique, but also the same
for retransmitted requests within the same transaction. I suppose this
can be done by having them compute the branch ID param as a hash of the
To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, R-URI and top Via of the incoming request,
along with the process-ID, IP address or some other invariant unique to
each proxy instance. This should probably also be noted in the spec.

[...]

In a nutshell, timing and speed.  A signaling protocol like SIP needs 
finer access to timeouts and a fast transport.  TCP's three-way hand-
shake can take to the order of a few milliseconds on a LAN to hundreds
of milliseconds or a few seconds on a WAN.  

UDP provides SIP with a finer grain access to timing information as well 
as a fast transport.  Unfortunately, that comes with the disadvantage of
implementing re-transmission and ordering of packets.

Jonathan Rosenberg has a I-D on transporting SIP over SCTP, which is
being designed to be a faster (than TCP) and lighter (than TCP) 
transport protocol, but having some of the same reliability mechanisms
as TCP.

I am sure there are other reasons besides timing and speed; I can think
of these two off the top of my head.

ACK is a special request used ONLY for an INVITE request.  However, for 
the purpose of a transaction, ACK comprises a transaction of its own.  
The ACK request following the INVITE is not considered part of the 
transaction since it may traverse a different set of hosts to get to the 
callee (or the UAS) than the INVITE did.

Cool.  Can we now remove the 
 "A server that is capable of hiding Via headers MUST attempt to
  decrypt all Via headers marked as "hidden" to perform loop detection.
  Servers that are not capable of hiding can ignore hidden Via fields
  in their loop detection algorithm."
paragraph (Section 6.25 of bis01), then, since this is now
unnecessary to detect loops?

Gethin,

Just as long as it is understood that the backslash character
cannot be used anywhere else in the start line or headers.
Otherwise there is the parsing concern of having to recognize
headers before understanding that CR or LF preceded by a
BACKSLASH truely escapes the CR or LF.

Consider the following to split headers:

        precondition:     ^(([^\\]([\\].)*?)*?)
        match condition:  (\n|\r\n?)
        postcondition:    [^ \t]

The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'The SIP INFO Method'
<draft-ietf-sip-info-method-05.txt> as a Proposed Standard.  This
document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group.  The IESG contact persons are Scott Bradner and Allison Mankin.
 
Technical Summary
 
 This document adds an extension to SIP by which SIP messages can carry
 application-specific information along the SIP processing path.  The
 messages are treated as opaque and they do not alter the state of a SIP
 session.  The document offers examples and guidelines for how the extension
 might be used.

Working Group Summary

 There is strong working group consensus to adopt the INFO method as a
 SIP component, and good consensus to do so as an extension to SIP rather
 than including INFO in the base SIP spec at this time.

Protocol Quality

 Vern Paxson reviewed the spec for the IESG.

Farhan,

I think that much of the type of functionality you are suggesting for
'siplets' might actually be provided by the SIP Servlet API:

http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/ak/sip/servlet/

Although the name might suggest that these apply only to SIP Servers, in
fact they are applicable to any SIP client and so can be used to install and
upgrade SIP clients in terminals just as you have mentioned.  See :

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-odoherty-sip-servlet-delivery-0
0.txt 

Cheers,

Mick.

i have lost an earlier draft of my posting. maybe it never got posted.
anyway, here it goes again:

this is absolutely the way to go. one method ought to do just one thing
completely. i am completely convinced that each method ought to do just one
thing. we cannot have another ioctl() horror on the sip stack.

If SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, MESSAGE, BYE are all the same, evidently their
interpretation is completely between the user agents themselves. In that
sense they are a recommendation of how SIP can be applied to add more
functionality. Much like SIP is encapsulated in UDP, we are encapsulating
more methods within the SIP architecture. To that extent, the interpretation
of SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, MESSAGE, etc. is  the problem of the recepient of the
requests.

one simple way to upgrade an ip phone is by rom replacement. online
upgrading has its own interesting possiblities. someone with a rogue
bluetooth on his palm can just walk around an office and download a trick
stack into all the ipphones (maybe this is just science fiction). But the
very interesting possiblities that it _does_ open up is that if we can
incorporate downloading of  'siplets' to SIP devices that run like applets
in secure sandboxes, we can come up with some pretty interesting
applications.

i imagine that such ip phones will also need a mechanism to download and
invoke method handlers. possibly a siplet specification in the body of the r
equest? if so, do we give provisional responses until the download is
complete ? what are the security managment issues involved with siplets?
this is an exciting possiblity. shall we try implementing something like on
a desktop UA that can download the request handlers.

the other approach will be to dish out everything from some sort of a
telephony application server that manages a number of sip phones (a proxy).
the added services are all build on the proxy server side. this keeps the
UAs themselves fixed and small. this is an approach that we took when we
designed hotfoon.com.

hotfoon.com - dumb VoiP terminals

hotfoon.com used a very simplistic protocol that transfered what ever a user
type to the server (raw) and whatever the server dished out directly to a
display window on the UA. Apart from the text messaging, just a single
call-setup/cleardown message pair was used to implement the session
initiation protocol. All the logic, including the call state was maintained
on the server side. the huge advantage was that it required virtually no
upgrades at all (the client is just a 48kb download including gsm codec). we
added features as the users demanded them. Someone asked for queues and we
implemented them, some asked for chat, we gave it to them. The idea was that
a simple VoiP client could be scaled up with innumerable features without
having to upgrade the clients themselves. Like all simplistic
implementations, it suffered on account of scalability (the servers were
stateful and had to deal with a lot  of concurrency issues). Nevertheless,
it still does handle hundreds of active users.

The idea explored in hotfoon.com was to implement dumb voip terminals,
wherein the intelligence was centralised (as different from sip where the
intelligence is towards the edge) in moderately powered telephony
application servers. it is still an interesting thing to toy around with.

Brian

I'm sorry, i think you've misunderstood me. what i'm saying is that
BACKSLASH never escapes CR or LF.

where ever CR or LF appear, they MUST be taken as header separators or
line folding.  nothing more, nothing less. they CANNOT be escaped.

so BACKSLASH can appear pretty much in any header (where allowed by the
bnf of course ;) )

thus CR & LF have been removed from the quoted-pair syntax below
because they cannot be escaped.

do you agree?

Ok, I've got an I-D available, any and all comments welcome:

ftp://ftp.dialout.net/drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sdp-tcpmedia-00.txt

I'm an admitted newbie to the whole I-D process, but based on my readings 
at www.ietf.org this needs to be submitted under the auspices of the SIP 
WG.  Can I just mail it to the internet-drafts@ietf.org address or are 
there other considerations to be dealt with first?

Well that has some (extremely) minor advantages:  It removes 5 lines of
assembler from my splitter ;)

But tell me: what is the use of backslashing other control characters
other than 0x08?  Particularly when backslashing those are optional?
(Only ,;"() really need be backslashed and only " must be within quoted
text and ) within a comment.  What's the point of having control
characters at all?

minor? it allows `\' to appear quite happily in any header without
confusion.  ahhh, you mean minor change to code, big change in
flexibility of the spec.

what is the point in backslashing 0x08? the only characters that MUST
be escaped are `"' in quoted string and `(' and `)' in comment (you
can have sub-comments).  there is absolutely no need what so ever to
escape any other characters.  so why did i leave them in the BNF?
because if i had of removed them someone else would have complained
about that.  besides i suppose this way is more backwards compatible if
you really want an explanation (and that's the nearest it gets ;) ). 
and of course, we can now parse quoted string and comment by simply
ignoring any character after a `\' without having to validate it to one
of `"', `(' and `)' (assuming of course that we have stripped line
folding prior to this :) ).

Speaking of line folding, now when I am folding lines I must watch out
for the construction [\\][ \t], otherwise I might erroneously place a LF
where the space was and violate the new BNF.  Otherwise, I have to scan
through and remove those constructions.  (I know, you'll say don't build
them that way in the first place, but most headers I don't create as a
proxy, I receive them.)  How about excluding %x09 and %x20 from the list
as well?  That way I know that I can always fold a line at TAB or SP.

quoted-pair = "\" (0x00 - 0x08 | 0x0b | 0x0c | 0x0e - 0x1f | 0x21 - 0x7f)

Gethin,

You might want to take that double backslash
out of the list too:  less problems when there's
three of them in a row.  Such as ////" vs /////".

 quoted-pair =
    "\" (0x00 - 0x08 | 0x0b | 0x0c | 0x0e-0x5b | 0x5d-0x1f | 0x21-0x7f)

I'm new to SIP and want to make sure I understand how addressing of the
streams is done. In particular, I want to check that it is not required that
the audio be routed to the same IP address as the SIP messages.
For example if I want all SIP messages to be sent to 192.168.200.1, but I
want the audio for a particular call to be sent to 192.168.200.5, port 3456
, is it legal to do the following:

C->S:	INVITE sip:test@test.address.com SIP/2.0
	Via: SIP/2.0/UDP some.server.com
	From: 192.168.200.1
	To: Test <sip:test@test.address.com>
	Call-ID: 662606876@192.168.200.1        
	CSeq: 1 INVITE
	Contact: 192.168.200.1
	Subject: Send audio there, no here.

	m=audio 3456 RTP/AVP 0 3
	a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
	a=rtpmap:3 GSM/8000

Note that the address in "From"/"Contact" is different from the address in
"c=". Is this the proper way to do it?
Thanks

Correct - it is not required.

Your syntax is a bit wrong; the Contact header is a URL, as is the From:

From: sip:caller@server.com
Contact: sip:caller@192.168.200.1

Otherwise OK.

Hi David,

Great work !!

Here are my comments:

- Section 1.2: Are you referring to the driection parameter ? If so, then
Section 1.1 should also refer to this parameter to be consistent.  
- I think there should be an assumed direction of "both" if the direction
parameter is missing.
- IMO, in Section 2.3 the statement "Endpoints may choose to specify
direction:both under one or more of the following conditions:" should be
reworded as none of the bullets are really "conditions". Perhaps "Endpoints
may choose to specify direction:both for one of the following reasons:"
would be better. 
- In the case of both sides using "direction:both" I believe we decided not
to close either of the tcp connections to avoid a race condition. I think
someone made to point that the stated algorithm doesn't work is both sides
are behind ALGs. Can anyone confirm?
- I think that "the endpoints intend to use one/two TCP connections" should
be removed from the second and third reasons for using direction:both
(Section 2.3). If we are not dropping one of the TCP connections (see above)
then those two statements don't make a lot of sense. In my mind, there are
only two main reasons for using direction:both: 1) want to allow otherside
to specify either active or passive [your first point] 2) want to be able to
traverse a NAT or NAPT [your second point].
- In the case of both sides using "direction:both", it also needs to be
stated that each endpoint must be willing to receive media from either or
both connections. 

Cheers,

Robert.

I am missing something here; why does this eliminate loop detection?

I would like to stay compatible with the DRUMS (revision of RFC 822)
work, even though escaping will practically only be used in limited
circumstances. I don't think it's worth diverging here.

Henning,

What makes the DRUMS case any different?  Backward compatibility?  Does
this mean to be backwards compatible I should still continue to squeeze
received quoted text with [^\\]([\\].)* but only generate per the BNF?  I
thought that this was handled by the cannonical form: as in, the cannonical
form expresses what I should send, whereas, the BNF expresses what I should
receive (if I am a server).  Are you saying that I should replace my server
expressions from [^\\]([\\].)* to [^\\]([\\][\x00-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*
I think it makes sense to still use [^\\]([\\].)* regardless of the
definition of quoted-pair and use the cannonical rules when sending.

Quite frankly, I think [\\][\n] in a comment is a pretty natural
language kinda thing when trying to mark up a message by hand or include
human readible debuggin information.

Did DRUMS have some reasons why they did this?

agreed.  

also there are far too many implementations out there that will not want
any more changes to this as their code will work fine at the moment but
to start removing more stuff will mess them up.  And it is such
an insignificant part of sip anyway.

Henning,

Forget it.  Judging from what happened to my last header line nobody
handles it for 822 anyway!  Looks like there are those replacing any
[\\][^\"] in a quoted string with [^\"] before doing anything else.  My
escaped LFs turned into LF LF and the rest jumped into the body.

It doesn't eliminate Loop Detection, but it means that you don't
need to waste time decrypting Vias to check for loops.

Previously, I was concerned that this was a bogus approach, since
if you attempt to detect Loops by decrypting Vias, any ACKs or
CANCELs relating to this request would be ambiguous (would they be
for the "first" time you "saw" the request, or for the "second"?).
This is because there was no guarantee that the branch parameter
would be different in each case.

Requiring that the branch parameter is always unique alleviates
this problem; however, since you suggest adding some other
invariant, it now becomes possible for a proxy to identify its
"own" branch parameters.  Thus decrypting Vias for the sole
purpose of checking for Loops becomes rendundant.

I thought SCTP is an application level protocol that is designed to be
transported
over TCP/IP. My question is why it would be faster than TCP/IP. Also what
is
the point of build an application level protocol on top of another?

It is -- for now.  I belive the intent is for it to be another transport
in addition to UDP and TCP and reside at the transport layer, or if it
does not reside at the transport layer, to directly use the services of
the IP layer (a la ICMP or OSPF).  BTW, IP had another "faster than TCP" 
but "more reliable than UDP" protocol called RDP (Reliable Datagram
Protocol) -- don't know why it never caught on (if you look in your 
/etc/protocols file, you may still find an entry for it).  W. Richard 
Stevens in one of his seminal books proposes T/TCP (Transaction Oriented 
TCP) to be in much the same vein.  Don't know why it never caught on, 
either.

> My question is why it would be faster than TCP/IP. 

Take a look at 
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-13.txt
for many reasons.

Quick acceptance.  Until (and unless?) vendors modify their IP kernels 
to support another transport protocol, the easiest and most portable
way is to run it as an application level protocol.

I believe vendor support is coming soon.  Sun folks are talking about 
using SCTP for AAA.  Storage Area Network folks are talking about it
as well.

Dear All,
I would like to request your review of the working drafts for the CC/PP
specification. The latest version of the framework document is available
at  http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct/
and the vocabulary document is available at
http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-vocab/

In case you feel you need more context, the Requirements and
Architecture document outlines the use cases for CC/PP. It is available
at http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-ra/

We need your comments to move on in the publication process, but we also
need to speed up. So I would appreciate if you can send your comments to
the address in the documents no later than September 15.

Thanks, and looking forward to your comments
Johan Hjelm
Chair, CC/PP WG

SCTP runs over IP, not TCP.  There is also a method to allow it to run over
UDP.

Actually, since RTO.initial is 3 seconds by default, the call setup
delay is not likely to be significantly lower than TCP.

Hello all,

As Henning has pointed out below regarding the meaning of
recvonly/sendonly attribute in SDP body, it seems that there's an
incompatibility between SDP draft and SIP one.

Has this been confirmed to the SDP authors? Because I got the
impression that Henning was not sure about this. And if this is really
the case, then has a consensus been made regarding which one to use?

Personally, although I have implemented them as in the SIP draft, I
don't mind if it has to be changed.

cheers,
Bennylp

   Oh, OK. I see where you're going. I didn't read the

   With Kerberos based key distribution, Digest could
   be almost aribitrarily large given cross realm
   operation. With PKCROSS, you move the PKI
   problem to the KDC which makes for an even more
   scalable solution than pure PKI solutions. 
   Effectively, KDC's become PKI aggregators which
   shield the vagueries of cross realm policy from
   mere mortals.

   Not true. A cross realm Kerberos based solution
   would be more than adequate to give you a high
   level of confidence that a piece of information
   came from the realm it claims to have come from.
   And it doesn't require expensive public key 
   operations at the endpoints or proxies. The 
   only place that symmetric key solutions come up
   short is in their inability to deal with the
   situation where you can, without prior
   knowledge of the recipient, sign something that
   the recipient can verify directly. This is
   useful sometimes -- particularly in multicast
   cases -- but the unicast case only requires a
   an end to end INVITE to make that advantage
   disappear.

 > Are there statistics on the typical cert size?

   Probably, but I don't have any handy. I've
   heard that typical certs are ~500 bytes and
   that you need to ship part of the hierarchy
   which may include a cert or two more. Even if
   it's half, it's still problematic for multiple
   realms.

   Is that actually true? If you posit a
   pre-shared symmetric key between the two
   entities, both digest and PGP provide a
   means of doing symmetric key signatures.
   It's true that there isn't a SIP endorsed
   means of shipping Kerberos credentials, but
   that doesn't mean that symmetric key PGP or
   Basic/Digest couldn't be used as-is. I've
   promised to write an ID by this fall on how
   to do this, so we shall see.

This is the SIP list, not the SCTP list.  If you have questions on
SCTP, you might want to take them over to the SCTP list
(sigtran@standards.nortelnetworks.com).

SCTP runs over IP, and does not use UDP or TCP.  Originally, it
was going to be layered on UDP (not TCP), but that was changed.
It now runs directly on IP, as a layer 4 equivalent to UDP or TCP.

For SAN I am aware of two new protocols - DAFS (Direct Access File System)
and SoIP (Storage over IP),  which of these are considering SCTP?

Can you point us to a resource or person for Sun using SCTP for AAA?

Thank you,
David

Does SIP have a mean of agreeing on an audio frame length betweem two
devices (e.g .30ms of audio exchanged in each RTP packet).
Thanks

Minutes of SIP WG at IETF48 (Draft)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Edited by Dean Willis, 8/28/2000



Monday Session
_____________

Agenda Bashing and Startup

Scott Bradner reviewed IPR notice.
Karen O'Donahue volunteered to take notes.
Proposed agenda review, no discussion.

Status of Working Group Efforts -- led by Jonathan Rosenburg

Guidelines for Authors proceeding as expected.

Caller Preferences proceeding, some discussion on removal, agreement to
proceed to last call.

Info draft

Reliability of Provisional Messages submitted to IESG on July 10.

Supported/Server features on IESG agenda for consideration.

Open List Issues -- Rosenburg

Multiple transport parameters (Transports:). Could be a new parameter, or
could be lisetd in the Contact: field with multiple Contact: headers.
Discussion ensued, with both SRV (poor for negotiation) and SLP (possible
for interdomain) mentioned. Henning summarized consensus that the number of
transports is relatively small and the existing mechanism seems to work for
now.

How to handle OPTIONS and REGISTERS if max-forwards-0? Suggestion made that
OPTIONS return 483, REGISTER be silently discarded. lennox objected to
special behaviors for different methods. Henning asserted that max-forwards
is really for debugging, and the handling isn't all that critical.

Additional Detail on error Messages (Dave's Error Messages): Sparks suggest
use of Refer (to, by) headers. Dave Oran prefers new failure-info header.
Olson and others argues against overloading  Contact. Henning argued need
for explicit header. General consensus resulted on basic Dave mechanism with
new explicit header.

Mandatory UDP: Some hot debate, no real conclusion. Lawrence Conroy argued
need for a simple TCP-only system, and Jonathan Lennox noted that making UDP
mandatory has security implications for systems that are trying to use TLS.

DTMF discussion was deferred to Session 2.

Embedded Images: Much discussion on issues of size, direct vs. indirect
embedding  and relating content to messaging. Henning Schulzzrinne, Adam
Roach, Sean Olson, and Scott Petrack made points. General consensus seemed
to be to stay with 2543 approach and to prefer indirect reference where
feasible.

Case Sensitivity of URLS: (URI Comparison) general consensus for documented
approach. Rohan Mahy suggested some sort of locally extended flexibility be
considered.

Session-Timer: Several changes reveiwd. Jonathan Lennox asked if it is
legitmate for a Require: header to be inserted by a proxy.



Context and Architecture for SIP-T -- Aparna Vemuri

Purpose: feature transparency.

Issues
* SIP MIME type negotiation - standard 415
* Want to be able to tell a UAS to ignore certain MIME types

- ISUP repitition problem: * not all ISUP parameters are needed; many will
contain information
from origination side



Changes in DCS -- Bill Marshall

All six drafts now in compliance with rfc2026.

Manyfolks: handling of case where UAS wants preconditions, but UAC didn't
indicate support for it

Privacy: 1) Needed to add proxy-require. 2) Removed authentication ?? sip
security task force will handle.  3) OSPS removed. 4) Editorial changes to
align with Guidelines.

State: 1) Usage of Supported/Require added . 2 )Interaction with Hide. If
Via headers hidden, then state headers need to be hidden -> resulting in
Proxy-Require. 3) will change syntax to include port number.

Call Authorization: only minor editorial changes

Architectural Draft: Much larger in size

Proxy-Proxy: 1)  DCS Specific extensions tracing of obsence and harassing
calls resource coordination for packetcable call transfer and three way
calling. 2.  OSPS, Billing-Info, Require and Proxy-Require used. 3) Next
steps: * design complete, * maybe issues for inter-domain operation, * 4
documents for proposed.  Consensus was achieved on adding four proposed
drafts as wg items. Informational draft will be on hold until proposed
documents are complete.

Update on rfc2543bis -- Henning Schulzrinne

Nothing thats not backwards compatible. Not SIP/2.1.

Lots of clarifications:

* ACK Forwarding
* consistencies between tables and texts
* e-e vs. h-h distinction has been deprecated, different table
which describes what proxies are allowed to do

* headers tentatively added

* separate call and transaction state machines

* cancel/invite are separable
(will need to add note on need for timer in cancel, since you may
not get a 487)

* addition of spirals

* split spec in half - framework and methods draft

MIB Draft -- Dave Walker

Partition of MIB: SIP common, UA, Server (proxy and redirect), Registrar

Support modules: Added support for multiple instances in the same system,
throttling, some security things in there.



Wednesday Session
_______________


Message Waiting Indicator -- Rohan Mahy

Several issues were raised in discussion: 1) Should compare and contrast
with HTTP and poll models such as POP and with SNMP, asnwer "why these are
not suitable and SIP-MWI is". 2) A MWI is really just a presence information
bit, it might be more appropriate to just use the presence mechanisms, 3)
the alerting mechanism should be designed generically rather than
specifically as a voice-mail function.

SIP-H.323 requirements -- Radhika Roy

Point made -- this interworking is for basic call, not extra signaling like
Q.SIG. Also, IETF work should not address purely operational issues.

Call Flows -- Johnston

Several changes and corrections have been made.Multiproxy and transfer
additions needed. Caveat: this is  not a complete debug list, we probably
need to do some more work in that respect.

OSP Token -- Johnston and Thomas

consensus was to include it as a header
question: can you include a reference to the token instead of the actual
token?
Note: Proxies may read or insert but not modify tokens.
question: maybe recommend tcp since the tokens are large

DTMF -- Skip Cave and Bert Culpepper

Skip proposes that there are two problems - dtmf transport, readily covered
by RTP, and key input, which is a different problem. This is supported by a
historical analysis of the deployment of DTMF applications. Discussion
centered on solving the user input problem. Donovan proposed using
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanisms to establish a signaling relationship for user
input. Question: do app servers need access to the RTP stream?

No conclusion

Emergency Services -- Henning Schulzrinne

Discussion centered on the applicability of SLP, with some contention..
Brian Rosen's note indicate that there was a consensus indicating that SLP
should be usable. Issues, however, extend beyond SIP -- for example,
emergency services for Web users?

Appliance Framwork -- Stan Moyer

No discussion allowed by chairs due to time constraints.

AAA Requirements -- Calhoun, etc.

Comments:Must take into account discussions in the AAA group.
Problem space must include use of services other than Internet Access logon.
Get discussion on sip rqmts onto the list


3rd Party Call Control with SDP preconditions -- Gonzalo Camarillo

No comments, two open issues will be taken to the list.

CC/PP exchange -- Iizuka

Comments:
This is similar, perhaps overlapping the caller preferences problem (Ed:
actually, it's the flip side of the same problem).
SIP may not be the right answer to this question -- or maybe we haven't
asked the right question yet.
This approach raises the question of whether the Guidelines should include a
direction for atomicity.

TIPHON work on SIP -- Sijben

No discussion due to time

SIP Firewall Policy mechanisms -- Jon Peterson

No discussion due to time

Call Control and Transfer -- Robert Sparks

Refer is not just for INVITES anymore. It has utilility in other methods.
Also, generalizing method to point to an arbitrary URL has interesting impli
cations.

While you are correct that we should use Kerberos like security 
servers,  Kerberos itself is broken. It has been broken for some time.

The problem is described in http://theory.stanford.edu/~tjw/krbpass.html, 
and with the passage of time the problem becomes ever worse, due to the 
increased power of offline dictionary attack hardware and software.

A modern security system, (which kerberos is not) must only permit online 
attacks on the password.  Kerberos permits offline attacks. In a modern 
system the attacker must only be able to test his guesses by using the 
guessed password to attempt to establish a secure connection to the 
security server.  After some large number of consecutive failures, the 
security server will temporarily disable the account, and send to the user 
an insecure notification containing a log of all information about the 
failed attempts.  After each successful logon, the system sends the user 
information about all previous failed attempts through the secure connection.

The proposal to use PGP keys or verisign keys uses modern security 
techniques to solve the wrong problem.

The proposal to use kerberos techniques addresses the right problem in the 
right way, but the particular details of the solution are obsolete.

I propose the following EKE like solution, similar to that described in my 
web page http://catalog.com/jamesd/kong/secure_video.htm

The user establishes a secure connection with the secure personal presence 
server.

The personal presence client logs in to the personal presence server using 
the name and password.  The password is never revealed to the server.   An 
outside attacker would have to try his guessed password by attempting to 
log on.  If he tried lots of logons, this would become noticeable.

The server knows, not the password p , but h(p)*G where G is an elliptic 
point that the server makes known to anyone.

When the user created his account, his client software informed the server 
of h(p)*G through https.  The software ensures that it gave this account 
creation information only to the real server, thanks to the usual https 
mechanism, which guarantees the server's true name.  The server does not 
need to verify the users true name.

Lower case letters stand for very large integers, upper case letters stand 
for elliptic points. h(x) means "one way hash of x "

The object of the logon protocol is to ensure that the client program is 
communicating with a server that knows h(p)*G , and the server knows it is 
communicating with a client who knows h(p)    In this the protocol differs 
from SPEKE, where both the client and the security server both know 
p.   The implementors have to keep in mind the usual EKE concerns described 
in http://world.std.com/~dpj/speke97.html.

When the user logs on he sends the server his logon name in the clear, The 
server generates a true random number b , and sends the user b*G .

The client similarly generates a true random number c and sends the server c*G.

An attacker can discover c*G, b*G, and G, but cannot calculate c or b from 
this information.

The client then generates the secret elliptic point (b*G)*[c+h(p)]

The server similarly generates the secret elliptic point b*[(c*G)+(h(p)*G)] 
, which will be equal to the point generated by the client.  This elliptic 
point is then used as the symmetric secret key for secure communications 
between client and the security server until the user logs off.

In order to succeed with the protocol, in order for the client to construct 
a secret elliptic point equal to that of the server, it must know h(p) 
corresponding to the server's h(p)*G
Of course, ultimately our objective is not secure communications with the 
security server, but secure communications between any  two users, and 
secure communications between a user  and all the various entities that are 
involved in setting up his communication.

The simplest way of solving this is the classic DH method, now patent free, 
where each entity generates one true random transient public/private key 
pair, which lasts the duration of a login session.  Each security server 
authenticates the public keys of its users and entities, and only the user 
or entity knows the private key.

This could potentially lead to a very large number of public key 
operations, which are quite slow  Because the keys change infrequently, 
this problem can be solved by each entity caching the results of previous 
public key operations.   The cache is discarded when the entity logs out..

When Bob sends an authenticated and secure message to Ann, saying "Hi Ann, 
how are things?" it would use intolerable bandwidth if that message, and 
each of the various acks and nacks by various entities required to locate 
Ann and set up and send the message, required a verisign style public key 
signature, or pgp style public key signatue.

Instead, for any two entities, there will be a unique DH shared secret, 
constructed from each one's DH key.  Each obtains the other's public DH key 
from the others security server.  That unique shared secret will not change 
as long as both entities remain logged on to their security server.   Since 
each ack and nack will be sent encrypted using that unique and unchanging 
shared secret, no  public key operations will be needed to prove who is 
sending the ack, since only the apparent author or the apparent recipient 
could decrypt it or encrypt it.  We have only one public key operation per 
logon time per pair of entities that need to communicate securely, which 
will have an insignificant bandwidth and computational cost, not several 
public key operations per ack and nack, as would be required if we employed 
a signature system similar to that employed by verisign or PGP.

Solution 2 is quite ok. This would offer a possibility
to separate parallell transactions within a SIP session, 
which is a good thing :)


You might want to consider the case below though:

***************************************************************************


                     ---------> u1@p2  ---> ub1@cb1
                     |
  ua@ca  ------> u@p ---------> u2@p2  ---> ub2@cb2
                           


ca sends an INVITE to u@p, which forks the request to 
different users. As it turns out, both ub1@cb1 and ub2@cb2 sends
a 200 OK and "p" happens to be able to forward multiple 200 OK's. 
ca is an implementation that could actually ACK both of the 200 OK's 
and setup and represent parallell media sessions towards both cb1 
and cb2 for the single SIP session.

Imagine "p" implementing some service or controlling a
firewall or media proxy for example. "p" would then have to 
keep the different "sub-sessions" apart, because, cb1 & cb2
could hang up at different occasions.

Consider "p" and "p2" to be Record-Routing.

When cb2 hangs up it would appear in "p" as:

BYE ua@ca, Route ua@ca

and when cb1 hangs up it would appear in the proxy as:

BYE ua@ca, Route ua@ca


How should "p" be able to determine which "sub-session" the BYE
is for? 

***************************************************************************


So when thinking about it once more, Jonathans suggestion with 
a URI parameter, might be the most appropriate one?




Best Regards,

   Loita Jahnsson

Hi,

What you have is the a=ptime SDP parameter. However, as the draft says,
it is only used as a "recommendation", and that it should not be
necessary to know ptime to handle the media stream.

Hi
In draft 00(fig :10 )   via-received was ( via-received = "received"  "=" host[:port] ) But in draft
01 it has been changed to via-received = "received"  "=" host .
 Does this mean port will not be changed.

When using the received parameter the port will be taken from the via
value itself not the parameter.  this is because it is not guarenteed
(or even likely) that the port the message was sent from is the same as
the port it will receive on.

From p's point of view the topmost Via would be different
thus identifying the two possible BYEs as non isomorphic
requests. Also in this example a tag in the From 
differentiates the call legs if the proxy needs to be 
call stateful for some specialised service.

I have one question to ask?
When to use stateful proxy, is 
there any principles?
  What's more, I want to know especially
in telecommunication when to use stateful 
& stateless? Who can give me some examples?

Hi Jonathan,

In your SIP ML Open Issues presentation for IETF48 ....

http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/meets/IETF48/slides/pres-rosenburg-sipwg_jul0
0_listissues.ppt

the last slide mentions "Quotes in WWW-Authenticate" and details....

<quote>

BNF and examples for params in WWW-Authenticate inconsistent in http
Do we use quotes or not?
Proposal:
    Quotes

</quote>

I'm confused with this slide as I'm unaware of an open issue in this area.
The BNF is quite clear, however the examples given in "SIP Telephony Call
Flow Examples"
(http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-01.txt)
are inconsistent with the SIP specification.
This might have led to the confusion which appears to surround the four
headers used for authentication.

I can appreciate that there is some scope for lenient parsing of the
parameters in the authentication related headers, but as far as I'm
concerned the spec seems fine.

Can you clear up my confusion?

Thanks In Advance
Phil Hoffer

Henning,

small point for Warning header (bis 01 section 6.47 page 60):

warn-agent = ( host [:port ] ) | pseudonym

pseudonym is never defined.  i assume it is to be defined as in the
http spec:

pseudonym = token

THis is not a specification  thing; its purely up to each server.

Generally, stateless will mean faster operation, but fewer services and
capabilities. Stateless is usually better for things like fault
tolerance, hot standbys and load balancing.

Stateful is needed for many services, like CFNA, as a simple example. As
such, a stateful proxy is usually slower, and the existence of state can
complicate failover and load balancing.

Actually, the RTP spec says you do not need to know ptime. From rfc1890:

>  For packetized audio, the default packetization interval should have
>    a duration of 20 ms, unless otherwise noted when describing the
>    encoding. The packetization interval determines the minimum end-to-

> 

Notice the next to last sentence.

This has been expanded upon in the revised spec:

> For packetized audio, the default packetization interval SHOULD have
>    a duration of 20 ms or one frame, whichever is longer, unless
>    otherwise noted in Table 1 (column "ms/packet").  The packetization

Same basic idea.


It is for this reason that ptime is not the subject of "negotiation";
its an fyi parameterm.

It looks like your argument is not with the SIP WG
but with the CAT WG. I'm sure a lot of folks there
would be willing to entertain (or not) this
argument. In particular, the assertion that that
Kerberos is inherently subject to dictionary
attacks looks more like an indictment against
symmetric key cryptography in general, rather than
Kerberos in particular.

Dear All:

    I would like to initial discussion on what the best
systematic/consistent way to invoke network feature services by SIP
signaling without
    losing SIP advantages.
    If this topic has been discussed fully before, please point me to
the conclusion.


    Thanks,

    Hong Chen

there is a complexity result that use of "public key techniques
are unavoidable for password protocols that resist off-line
guessing attacks." i doubt we can require that in all
environments...

The first line of defense against dictionary attacks in Kerberos is a reasonable password policy. The paper you cite does nothing to show that a reasonable password policy is not adequate to prevent these attacks - the paper demonstates attacks against a Kerberos 4 realm with a very weak password policy. In particular, some users had passwords with 1 character, some had passwords with 2 characters, etc.

The port the packet was received on is immaterial, so including it makes
no sense. (The response is always sent back to the port indicated
explicitly in the
'main' Via part, not the source port of the request.) Whether the
'received' part then has much use in practice beyond a "warning, NAT
encountered, return trip may not work" is not clear to me.
