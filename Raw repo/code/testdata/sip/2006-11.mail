Ok, that's fair. I wouldn't describe that as a PSTN Gateway so much  
as I would describe it as a multi-user UA that uses telephone  
handsets to implement its user interface devices. By the same token,  
it would be OK to run sips: to a Mac that uses a Bluetooth headset,  
even though Bluetooth isn't TLS.

By PSTN gateway, I mean a box that converts the SIP call into a  
signaled call on a PSTN line (especially a "trunk" line).

Of course, once you stick an fxo line on that multiuser-UA box and  
start pumping calls back into the P (that's Public) STN, you have a  
security problem again. This could easily happen with a PBX, so that  
could be a problem. It might be legit to say that a PBX simply can't  
do sips:, because it can't meet the security assurances of sips:.

yes, in sip things have been totally opposite.  this working group has

Dean,

I think your proposal is moving in the right direction, but I have a couple
of concerns. See below.

[JRE] Whilst I agree with the above, I am concerned that the UAs involved
will not know whether best effort has resulting in a signalling path that is
secure on all hops. Why do I want to know? Suppose I have feature X that
somehow relies on all hops being secure. If I want the request to fail if I
can't use feature X, then I use SIPS. However, if I want the request to
succeed even if I can't use feature X (because some hops are insecure), then
I need some indication of whether all hops are secure or not, and then I can
decide whether to use feature X. Giving an example of a feature X is not so
easy, but one possibility could be identity. I might anonymise the From
header in a SIP request, and then, if it results in a dialog that is secure,
I might use connected-identity to change the From header field URI
mid-dialog. As another example of a feature X, maybe I am prepared to use
media security using SDescriptions if the dialog is secured, without using
S/MIME. Therefore I find the dialog is secure I re-negotiate the session,
this time with SDescriptions.

[JRE] As I stated in one of the related threads, I think SIPS should govern
hops as far as the PSTN gateway, and the potential insecurity of whatever is
beyond that gateway should be signalled by other means. Achieving a SIPS
connection as far as the gateway might allow me to use SDescriptions to
achieve media security to that gateway. I can't do much about what is beyond
the gateway, but a separate indicator that says that it might not be secure
would allow me, for example, to suppress the security padlock.

[JRE] No, but you might want authenticated media. It is all very well saying
that the signalling comes from the person you think it comes from, but if
the media is coming from somewhere else, that doesn't help the average user.

I don't think you will get agreement on this.

I think this rule will have to be very different.  Instead
of saying that we MUST or MUST NOT, it should be a section
on making readers aware of the security implications.
In my opinion, it's a policy thing, not a standards thing.

There is a benefit in having secure SIP being used upto
the PSTN gateway.

Seems that we need a mechanism to create a trusted "channel" between
endpoints that goes through all the intermediaries. The channel should
verifiable as secure between the endpoints. After the channel is created
then the SIP signalling can go securely over the channel.

The protocol for creating such a channel may be SIP based on
external to SIP and after we have such a mechanism we can decide if we
will use SIPS for messages that need to go over the secure channel
or we will use new URI type (e.g. SSIP) or just use some
header in the SIP message.

The other alternative is the usage of S/MIME which has its drawbacks as
we can see in another thread.

Other then a secure channel or S/MIME I do not think that it will be
possible to send a SIP message and get real assurance that the message
will be sent securely in every hop.

I'm very tempted to endorse this, but I think you're missing one thing.

Flimsy as it is, I believe that sips: is as strong as the rest of the 
current SIP security model since it depends on the same trust 
assumptions.

We can't just restart on sips: without restarting from those 
fundamental trust assumptions.

This is not trivial. Many people would argue that it would turn SIP 
into a fundamentally different protocol. I think it needs to be done, 
but I also think we need to clearly document how the current trust 
model (including sips:) works, because that's what's going to be 
deployed in the real world for a relatively long time.

The P2PSIP work is having to re-examine those fundamental trust 
assumptions. My current hope is we can do some work there that can be 
"ported back" into SIP.

Actually I did not understand why the reg-id should be encoded into this =

Could you please clarify the reason for its presence ? Or could the URI =

Jonathan,
=20
Regarding your outbound-discovery-mid-dialog draft: I believe it can =
work, but the example given in section 15 has some glitches and may =
result in sub-optimal routing.
=20
The backup flow from the UA x should have a different reg-id, say =
reg-id=3D*2* (instead of 1 as per the example in the draft). Assume =
there is also a user y registered, via proxy 1 and proxy 3. Then the =
connection table at the home proxy would look like
=20
TLS connection to 1:
    sip:outbound.example.com
    =
sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+y1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun

TLS connection to 2:
    sip:outbound.example.com
    =
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun
=20
TLS connection to 3:
    sip:outbound.example.com
    =
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+*2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun
    =
sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+*y2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun=

=20
Consequently, when proxy 2 fails, there will be no "most specific" match =
for message 35, only least specific ones. The request should go to proxy =
3, but the home proxy could equally likely select proxy 1 (which would =
then perform triangular routing via proxy 2).=20
=20
To have the home proxy favor proxy 3 in this scenario, I believe we need =
a URI parameter to hold the reg-id, instead of putting it in the user =
part. If we would then define that flow selection should be performed =
based on the URI from which the reg-id parameter is stripped, there =
would be a partly specific match for proxy 3 and failover would work =
more smoothly
=20
Regards,
Jeroen

Erkii,

The idea is to create 'stickiness', to prefer using the same flow for all 
requests unless it fails. So in order of decreasing preference:
1. Flow with same reg-id
2. Flow with other reg-id
3. Flow towards same FQDN (proxy cluster)

Note that the matching algorithm I describe below is incomplete, what is 
needed is a set of rules that result in the above order of preference (in 
other words, binary equality is insufficient, we need multiple degrees of 
equality i.e. exact match, partly specific match, weak match (sam FQDN) and 
no match)

Regards,
Jeroen

  Hi,

  Actually I did not understand why the reg-id should be encoded into this 
URI at all.

  Could you please clarify the reason for its presence ? Or could the URI be 
constructed
  without the reg-id included to any part of the URI ?

  Regards,

    Jonathan,

    Regarding your outbound-discovery-mid-dialog draft: I believe it can 
work, but the example given in section 15 has some glitches and may result 
in sub-optimal routing.

    The backup flow from the UA x should have a different reg-id, say 
reg-id=*2* (instead of 1 as per the example in the draft). Assume there is 
also a user y registered, via proxy 1 and proxy 3. Then the connection table 
at the home proxy would look like

    TLS connection to 1:
        sip:outbound.example.com
        sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+y1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun

    TLS connection to 2:
        sip:outbound.example.com
        sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun

    TLS connection to 3:
        sip:outbound.example.com
        sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+*2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun
        sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+*y2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun

    Consequently, when proxy 2 fails, there will be no "most specific" match 
for message 35, only least specific ones. The request should go to proxy 3, 
but the home proxy could equally likely select proxy 1 (which would then 
perform triangular routing via proxy 2).

    To have the home proxy favor proxy 3 in this scenario, I believe we need 
a URI parameter to hold the reg-id, instead of putting it in the user part. 
If we would then define that flow selection should be performed based on the 
URI from which the reg-id parameter is stripped, there would be a partly 
specific match for proxy 3 and failover would work more smoothly

    Regards,
    Jeroen

Hi Jeroen,
=20
But when reading the overview of the draft I came to a different =
understanding about
the 'stickness' that this draft is trying to achieve. In order of =
decreasing preference:
=20
1. The specific flow used for a dialog as indicated by the URI =
parameters added into Record-Route
2. Any flow registered by the UA as indicated by the user part of the =
URI as added to Path & S-R
3. Any proxy within the cluster as indicated by the host part of the URI =
as in initial REGISTER
=20
I did not find reg-id to be significant in any of those three options. =
The instance-id (together
with username and the selected proxies for the outbound-proxy-set) is =
sufficient to identify
any existing flow (as for item 2).
=20
In which use case a proxy should be able to prefer a specific flow with =
a specific reg-id ?
I did not find any such use case in the draft.
=20
Regards,
=20
Erkki

Erkii,
=20
The idea is to create 'stickiness', to prefer using the same flow for =
all requests unless it fails. So in order of decreasing preference:
1. Flow with same reg-id
2. Flow with other reg-id
3. Flow towards same FQDN (proxy cluster)
=20
Note that the matching algorithm I describe below is incomplete, what is =
needed is a set of rules that result in the above order of preference =
(in other words, binary equality is insufficient, we need multiple =
degrees of equality i.e. exact match, partly specific match, weak match =
(sam FQDN) and no match)
=20
Regards,
Jeroen

Hi,
=20
Actually I did not understand why the reg-id should be encoded into this =
URI at all.
=20
Could you please clarify the reason for its presence ? Or could the URI =
be constructed
without the reg-id included to any part of the URI ?

Jonathan,
=20
Regarding your outbound-discovery-mid-dialog draft: I believe it can =
work, but the example given in section 15 has some glitches and may =
result in sub-optimal routing.
=20
The backup flow from the UA x should have a different reg-id, say =
reg-id=3D*2* (instead of 1 as per the example in the draft). Assume =
there is also a user y registered, via proxy 1 and proxy 3. Then the =
connection table at the home proxy would look like
=20
TLS connection to 1:
    sip:outbound.example.com
    =
sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+y1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun

TLS connection to 2:
    sip:outbound.example.com
    =
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun
=20
TLS connection to 3:
    sip:outbound.example.com
    =
sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+*2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun
    =
sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+*y2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=3Dstun=

=20
Consequently, when proxy 2 fails, there will be no "most specific" match =
for message 35, only least specific ones. The request should go to proxy =
3, but the home proxy could equally likely select proxy 1 (which would =
then perform triangular routing via proxy 2).=20
=20
To have the home proxy favor proxy 3 in this scenario, I believe we need =
a URI parameter to hold the reg-id, instead of putting it in the user =
part. If we would then define that flow selection should be performed =
based on the URI from which the reg-id parameter is stripped, there =
would be a partly specific match for proxy 3 and failover would work =
more smoothly
=20
Regards,
Jeroen

As you correctly conclude, P2P SIP has the opportunity to finally make
SIP secure.

Thanks, Henry

Seems that we need a mechanism to create a trusted "channel" between=20
endpoints that goes through all the intermediaries. The channel should=20
verifiable as secure between the endpoints. After the channel is created

then the SIP signalling can go securely over the channel.=20

The protocol for creating such a channel may be SIP based on=20
external to SIP and after we have such a mechanism we can decide if we=20
will use SIPS for messages that need to go over the secure channel=20
or we will use new URI type (e.g. SSIP) or just use some=20
header in the SIP message.=20

The other alternative is the usage of S/MIME which has its drawbacks as=20
we can see in another thread.=20

Other then a secure channel or S/MIME I do not think that it will be=20
possible to send a SIP message and get real assurance that the message=20
will be sent securely in every hop.=20

I'm very tempted to endorse this, but I think you're missing one thing.

Flimsy as it is, I believe that sips: is as strong as the rest of the =20
current SIP security model since it depends on the same trust =20
assumptions.

We can't just restart on sips: without restarting from those =20
fundamental trust assumptions.

This is not trivial. Many people would argue that it would turn SIP =20
into a fundamentally different protocol. I think it needs to be done, =20
but I also think we need to clearly document how the current trust =20
model (including sips:) works, because that's what's going to be =20
deployed in the real world for a relatively long time.

The P2PSIP work is having to re-examine those fundamental trust =20
assumptions. My current hope is we can do some work there that can be =20
"ported back" into SIP.

I am getting this question more and more. Right at home I am using the IX67
from Intertex.

But are there other SIP compatible modems or is Intertex still the only one
on this planet?

 

Such routers/modems must allow end to end SIP. In the LAN and the WAN. And
just SIP to a voice port for analog telephony connection does not count.

While I have some reservations on allowing any mechanisms to substitute for
TLS, I too am happy with your proposal.

Let me relate this to another offshoot of this discussion: when do you get
the lock icon?  Ignore, just for now, implication on the media channel.

Is there ANY possibility of getting a lock icon on any system using the
current PSTN or commercial PBX?

I think the only answer possible is "yes, use a STU" (a secure telephone
that can operate over an ISDN connection).  In no other circumstance would
anyone consider PSTN or PBX systems to be secure enough to get a lock icon.

Therefore, I think that if a part of the call traverse a PSTN or PBX leg, it
is not secured signaling, and sips should fail.

I think what you're talking about is SIPSEC, the draft Dean mentioned
earlier.
Good luck with that.  ;)

RE:[Sip] RE: TLS meaning))


Seems that we need a mechanism to create a trusted "channel" between 
endpoints that goes through all the intermediaries. The channel should 
verifiable as secure between the endpoints. After the channel is created 
then the SIP signalling can go securely over the channel. 

The protocol for creating such a channel may be SIP based on 
external to SIP and after we have such a mechanism we can decide if we 
will use SIPS for messages that need to go over the secure channel 
or we will use new URI type (e.g. SSIP) or just use some 
header in the SIP message. 

The other alternative is the usage of S/MIME which has its drawbacks as 
we can see in another thread. 

Other then a secure channel or S/MIME I do not think that it will be 
possible to send a SIP message and get real assurance that the message 
will be sent securely in every hop.

I think you mean UAC.  As far as SIP is concerned, the gateway is the
client.

Wow, that's a pretty slippery slope -- my home phone doesn't encrypt the
ringer bits before it hits my ear... sounds like by this definition, the 
call should
fail there too.

What strikes me about this is that there are different answers to all of 
this
depending on context. Which is why trying to encode all this into one "S"
bit in an URI scheme is hopeless. Bits are cheap; let them be fruitful and
multiply.

Imagine a system where you have PBX and an ISDN/SIP
gateway.  The office which uses the PBX want to be able
make secure SIP calls to the global internet.

So, if, as is said, "sips should fail", then these
users won't be able to use sips.

I don't think it is right to take sips ability away from
these users.  I mean, you could have the PBX in a secured room.
Wouldn't that be secure enough?

And how does one define "secured signaling" anyway?  And there's
nothing to stop anyone getting a SIPS phone and interfacing
it to something which is "insecure".

In my opinion, whether to allow SIPS must be decided by
the administrator and not nailed down in a standard.

regards,

	Attila

Clearly, we don't agree.

I would say that the PBX can't provide security to any other call, how could
it possibly provide security to a sips call?  One end is insecure.   

Dean has a proposed wording for what we mean, and I'm happy with that.  PSTN
(or PBX) doesn't do that.  

There are no protocol police, so of course you are correct that anyone can
break the rules and get away with it.  

We have standards to define what things mean, and this is an example of
needing such a definition.

I think we all agree that sips is not the only thing we need for signaling
security, and many of the ideas that have been discussed for further work
beyond sips (and S/MIME) have the notion that there is not a black/white
setting, one end should express it's desired security properties, and have a
way to determine if those properties have been met.  I like those thoughts,
will contribute to the development of such a mechanism, and think it will
address your concerns.  That's not sips.

That isn't even the case in https.  When you connect to an https server, you
have no idea how the back-end gets/stores/updates its info.  It could be
creating the page by pulling from another server using tftp as far as you
know.  If that https server gets/sends emails using the contents of a
post/get https message, it says nothing about how the emails you read got to
that server, or how emails you tell it to send are sent.  Despite that your
https post message caused an email to be sent (if it worked that way), the
web server is under no obligation to refuse to send the email, or break your
https connection, just because it sends them using smtp unsecured.

There is a difference however between and SBC and PSTN Gateway, in that
their security model are quite different.

Brian,

While I understand your point, and agree with it for the most part, I am 
having trouble turning it into a concrete set of rules.

In general, there are lots of things that can happen to the call 
signaling info, and the media, once it reaches the UAC or UAS. There is 
no guarantee that it is ever secure, regardless of the security of the 
link between the UAC and UAS:
- info can be displayed on a public display that can be viewed by
   parties other than the user of the device
- audio can be played in a way that can be heard by others
- some or all aspects of the session may be relayed to a peripheral
   device of the UA, e.g. a bluetooth headset, that is not secured and
   can be intercepted by others.
- the user of the UA may let someone else operate the device.

A PSTN GW is in effect no different than the bluetooth headset in this 
regard. Why should we allow one and not the other?

I think the most one can hope for is that the identity of the remote UA 
is known, and that the caller trusts the UA and its user to properly 
handle the information conveyed in the call.

When calling a phone number (e.g. +12125551234), the kinds of 
credentials that are available are somewhat dubious. I don't think we 
have any form of credential that actually states "I hold the 
responsibility for +12125551234". At best I think we may have something 
that says: "I have responsibility for sip:+12125551234@provider.com". If 
that happens to come from the operator of a gateway, then what it says 
about what happens on the other side of the gw is not clear - perhaps 
nothing.

Operationally, this might mean that if I was trying to call 
sip:+12125551234@provider.com, and I receive credentials for that back, 
and the path between us is secure, then I might consider the call 
secure. But if I was calling tel:+12125551234 and I receive back 
credentials for sip:+12125551234@provider.com then I might be wise not 
to consider this secure. That leaves the problem of whether there is 
ever a way to receive credentials for tel:+12125551234.

It did provide security for a sips session.  That session is between the UAC
and the sips UAS.  The UAS is the end, as far as sip/sips is concerned.  Are
you suggesting sips is more than a specific uri scheme for SIP, and somehow
a cross-protocol, universal fiat, based on an ambiguous definition of
"secure"?  :)

Will the BCP start listing all device types and roles, and whether they are
allowed to accept a sips request or not?  A Bluetooth handset is allowed to,
a home cablemodem (IAD) with an FXO interface is allowed to, but if that IAD
is classified as a PBX then not.  Unless that "PBX" is an open-source app in
my house PC.  But if my PC gets moved, then it needs to stop accepting sips.


This would be like classifying pornography.  "I know it when I see it."

I don't see the difference.

In either case, the call has reached a UA. From that point on you are 
trusting that the UA will do the right thing. The best you can do is 
determine the identity of that UA and decide if it is one you wish to trust.

If you have phone service from a provider that uses SBCs at its 
connection to the internet, when I call "you" I am really calling that 
SBC. All security and authentication properties are with it, not you or 
your devices. I must trust it. The same is true if I call a gateway.

Sure, but it's a different problem.

Media security and Signalling security are two different things.

SIPS is strictly about hop-by-hop signalling security with TLS.=20

That's why sips !=3D padlock item, otherwise, you'll give a false sense =
of
security to the "average user".

The difference is that there is a level of "security" on PSTN. You can't
do IP address spoofing for example. You can't tap into a hub.=20

(Yes, I know: there are ways to tap into analog lines too).

The point is that for many people, they are happy with the security
level provided by the PSTN, but not with the one provided by IP
telephony
or SIP when there is no TLS/SRTP/whatever.

That's my point.

So, I can see that, as Michael Thomas said, putting all the "attributes
of security" into the letter "s" is not terribly useful.

On the specific issue of "is sips allowed" when you leave the "network",
I am a bit
ambivalent.

I think if you are Leaving SIP and going to another IP protocol (say
H.323) then we
shouldn't allow SIPs.

However, for the PSTN case, I'm not sure. I think I'm ok either way. I
think arguments
on both sides are valid.

No I meant UAS. For a call originated from a SIP UA to a pstn user,
gateway is acting like a UAS.

There is some interpretation here.  The words in a BCP can only be so
precise.  I think the way Dean phrased it is okay.

I understand that any element may be using some protocols to do its job that
may involve some sense of security, and inappropriate choices may make the
security the endpoints think they are getting not actually be there.  I can
live with that.

I think that we don't consider the PSTN signaling to be "secure".  We
consider it more secure than open Internet in-the-clear signaling, but its
not secure.  I think sips should mean hop by hop, TLS (or equivalent as
Dean's text says) secure, and you can't do that on the PSTN.

Again, we can work on other security mechanisms that would let an endpoint
declare than a PSTN connection was acceptable.  That's not sips.

I think Dean's formulation is a sensible set of rules.  It's not airtight,
nor could it be.  It can be misinterpreted, accidentally or deliberately.  I
think the intent is clear, and I think the "Best Current Practice" language
is clear enough.  

I don't think that security across one set of UAC to UAS in the presence of
B2BUAs and gateways is useful to anyone.  I keep imagining TLS protection
from UAC to the edge of his own domain, through an SBC across the open
Internet with zero security to another domain, with another SBC and TLS from
that to the UAS.  Does that meet anyone's needs?  Does it have anything to
do with any sense of secure?  I think not.

The only difference between trusting the HTTP server and SIP proxy is
billing. And it is hop by hop. I mentioned the same case as cheater
proxy while discussing the cipher-suites.  Here Providers have enough
motivation to cheat, if enough checks are not provided.

A thought to ponder
When Calls on *IP only* are secured, how long PSTN / MGW will last ?

I think we are mature enough with enough feature differentials at our
hand.
Only missing things are security, security .... 911 ...

I feel we should just focus on IP only stuff first. Any opinion on this
is welcome.

For any patches to SIPS to work , I would like to see concrete proposal
catering
A) How it will interwork with future more elegant / complete proposals.
B) How it will transport other URI schemes.
C) How it will control the features outside of dialog. Like Presence
event
   Subscribers, REG-EV subscribers
D) How it will control the cipher-suite selection?

IMHO, let us accept SIPS is broken and not patchable in reasonable way.=20

Thx
Samir

I find much of (4) to be problematic for the reasons stated below. I 
think the concepts it bans are fuzzy. What exactly is a gateway to 
another protocol? Is the phone with a bluetooth headset a gateway to the 
bluetooth protocol?

What about B2BUAs bridging two sips requests? What constitutes 
"bridging" vs a UA that has another sip session for some related 
purpose? For instance, a UA might accept a SIPS call, and also use SIP 
(or SIPS) to update a presence server with info about the calls it is 
in. Others might be able to obtain info (such as the identity of the 
caller of the currently active call) from the presence server via SIP. 
Does that disqualify the use of SIPS?

And BTW, if we can figure out in what cases a gw may use sips, because 
it is gatewaying to an equivently strong protocol, then we can use that 
to show that its ok to use IPsec between a pair of servers.

I only see a couple of ways to sort this out:
- agree that sips ends when it gets to the UAS. What happens
   after that must be dealt with some other way.

- begin to formally specify types of UA, more than has been done so far.
   Write specific rules for each type about what it may and may not do
   when it has a sips connection. This would cover end user devices that
   signal outside their box, various kinds of gateways, types of SBC and
   B2BUA, etc.

I think it is problematic to do the latter. It can't really be done 
without considering what the SIPS connection is being used to protect. 
That gets into our longer term problem which may not even involve sips.

So I only see the former as a workable solution.

To be cynical, if IP calls are really secured, then they will probably 
be ruled illegal. Sellers of equipment and services will be forbidden 
from offering this capability.

  You need to have B2BUA in between providing CALEA. We need to specify
B2BUA behavior.

Francois,

I disagree. Just securing the signalling is not sufficient to prevent
impersonation, for example, unless the media is also authenticated and
integrity protected. As a user, what good is it to me if secure signalling
tells me that the caller is Francois, yet somebody is sending me unsecured
media from a different source?

I agree that SIPS != padlock. Therefore I am still trying to discover real
use cases for SIPS.

John

Is a call providing CALEA a secure call? Not in my book. Not if the only 
two choices are "secure" and "insecure". If there are more than two 
choices, then "secure except subject to CALEA" might be one of them.

As far as I know, FCC will not let you deploy without CALEA compliance.
Am I out-of-date on this?=20

IMHO, we will be having security with CALEA. This Security notion is to
avoid the Call Pattern tracking etc by attackers but the duly assigned
authorities will be open to record the conversation.

My view is "Secure except subject to CALEA" .

Thx
Samir

In summarization, I think your concerns all involve some variation of  
knowing "what happened downstream". Specifically, you want to know if:

1) A sip: URI scheme actually produced a dialog with encryption on  
all hops. You may want to know more about it than "encryption", for  
example you may want to know what sort of encryption, or what  
mechanism was used to authenticate the intermediary or terminus. By  
knowing you had succeeded in getting a secure channel, you could  
decide to engage other mechanisms (like key exchange) or activities  
dependent on that security.

2) The security of a sip: or sips: request is degraded (or  
potentially degraded) by a gateway threshold, beyond which the  
reporting mechanism has no visibility and which we would generally  
assume has fully denigrated our cryptographic protections. By knowing  
the security of sips: is not really end-to-end, you could moderate  
the invocation of other mechanisms or activities as appropriate for  
an unsecured channel.

I think these are great things to know. I think they go substantially  
beyond anything we can describe as a BCP for using sip: and sips:. I  
think this requires new mechanism, perhaps something like a mutant  
cross between history-info and Samir's cipher-suites draft.

The 2119-language here is in the requirements of practices, not the  
requirements for a protocol design. In short, we're saying "If you  
want to honor the operational requirements of a sips: URI scheme,  
then you MUST NOT downgrade the protection of the signaling to less  
than TLS on any hop. If you do, then you have not met the  
requirements of sips:, and you are lying about your security". In  
short, you are violating the contract of transitive trust.

Sure. And with the description of sip: URI processing given earlier  
(it will be secured if it can be secured) then sip: gives you as good  
of security as you would get by lying about your compliance with  
sips:. So placing a call using a sip: URI to the PSTN gateway would  
produce secure SIP.

See:

All Cisco routers are AFAIK completely SIP compatible. So are most  
other routers, I suspect.

What you want is a SIP-compatible network address translator. That's  
much harder.

One option that may be interesting is to run Asterisk embedded on a  
Linksys WRT-54GL using the OpenWRT replacement firmware. You can do  
some neat stuff with that. Or you can run a version of SER on he  
WRT-54GL, which gives another set of options.

But I'd like to point out that this is more of a sip-implementors (or  
maybe something else entirely) question than it is a SIP mailing list  
question.

My issue with this proposal is what headers are open to proxies to route
the initial request. I feel
To/From/CallId/ReqUri/Cseq/MAX-FORWARD/via/RecordRoute/Proxy-Require
etc..

My issue with this proposal is what headers are open to proxies to route
the initial request. I feel
To/From/CallId/ReqUri/Cseq/MAX-FORWARD/via/RecordRoute/Proxy-Require
etc..

Thx
Samir

How do you know? Specifically, how do you as a UA user on the SIP  
side of an SBC, B2BUA, or gateway know? All you have is trust that  
the widget honors the contract of sips:.

Sure, if it's a sips: compliant SBC/B2BUA, it could reasonably  
produce sips: on the other side and stay compliant to the intent of  
sips:.

But if it's converting to anything else (sip:, xmpp, ISDN, ISUP,  
whatever) it can't maintain the contract of transitive trust implied  
by sips:, and it MUST therefore NOT use sips:.

Well, many messages have come and gone since this one. So, I will 
respond to Francois's note here and make some additional points.

My own opinion:

1. no
2. yes

I fear that much of the objection to sips is wound up in its name. Its 
not "secure SIP" in the sense that there are certainly attacks that 
remain even if you use it. However, there is really no such thing as 
"secure SIP", anymore than there is really such a thing as "secure 
HTTP". I'll point out that with attacks like phishing, even https isn't 
providing people with what they think is "secure web browsing". But let 
us not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

What SIPS can do, once we fix it, is provide a particular property that 
I think is very valuable. In networks with trusted proxies, it prevents 
against a vast array of "outsider" attacks - eavesdropping, replay, 
modification, and so on. This property is very useful. I can't tell you 
how many SIP extensions have security considerations that are based on 
this property.

Just because sips doesn't address insider attacks (where the proxies are 
not trusted), does not make it useless. To be frank I fear there will 
never be a deployable solution for security where you don't trust the 
proxies. Its kind of like hoping the Internet works when you don't trust 
the routers. It would be nice but it sounds hard.

I believe we have also learned a lot since RFC 3261. WIth the arrival of 
sip-outbound, I believe we have the final tool needed to remove the last 
hop exception rule, and have a very useful security technique that is 
also extremely deployable. If you throw in DTLS as "ok" as well, you can 
even get around the TCP/UDP wars, and provide something that works for 
wireless too.

My two cents,
Jonathan R.

Samir,

When I submit confidential information to a web site over HTTPS I can check
the certificate and see that I am indeed sending information to MyBank.com
(of course, I have to trust MyBank.com to treat the information
appropriately once it gets there). Now if I want to do similar over a
SIP-initiated session, then likewise I want to see a caller/callee identity
signed by MyBank.com with media security bound to that identity in some way.
If instead I see a certificate for InterceptingServiceProvider.net, I will
be disinclined to submit confidential information and will find other ways
(e.g., HTTPS) to do the same thing. SIP becomes relegated to a PSTN
replacement or worse.

John

Francois,

The point about PSTN is that although it might be considered secure by some
people (although I have seen statements to the contrary), there is no way of
knowing what happens beyond the PSTN. There could be some other IP network
that does not apply security. Therefore there is always an element of doubt
over PSTN. However, if we retain SIPS (the need for which I am not yet
convinced of) then I think it is equally valid as far as the gateway, and
the job of indicating that there is some question mark over security beyond
the gateway should be addressed by some other means. As Paul says, an
identity such as sips:+12125551234@provider.com would tell you that you have
a secure connection to provider.com, and says nothing about what happens
beyond that.

That depends on what you mean by PSTN Gateway. If you're talking  
about a "phone adapter", like a PAP-2 or larger enterprise scale  
device, then you're talking about the user interface of a SIP UA, and  
sips: is ok.

OTOH, if you're talking about a device that converts the SIP  
signaling into some other signaling format (ISDN, ISUP, MF DTMF,  
XMPP, whatever) and transmits the results to another switching  
element, then you're well outside the applicability of sips:.

The scenario described could not be secure, of course not.
And no-one would argue with that.

However that is not the same as saying that SIPS can't be
considered "secure enough" for it's purpose.  There are
various levels of security but it all about what people
would consider acceptable.  I think a call going to a
SIPS/PBX gateway to a physically secure PBX to a phone
would be considered secure enough by most people.
An organization would probably consider their PBX to be secure
but would also like some security for SIP calls too.
SIPS should be able to provide this.

There are so many scenarios where SIPS would be useful
for a PBX gateway and even for a PSTN gateway.  It is
not about absolute security but about what is deemed
acceptable.

This issue is also about trust.  We have to trust
the things we're calling.  We have to trust the
people we're calling.  We make a secure call to them
and we trust that they're not going to broadcast=20
what you're saying on their speakerphone.  We trust
that they don't mike up your call and put it out
on the PA.

It could also be a political thing.  People might consider
PSTN to be quite safe but might consider computer networks to
be unsafe.  So the solution is to use SIPS for the computer
network part of the call to give people some sense of security.

SIPS to PSTN/PBX/ISDN gateway calls have to considered
in the context of their environment.
1. what is the required level of security?
2. is there trust?
3. is there a benefit?

The second one is more important than anything.
What good is a company which offers a super secure solution
if no-one trusts them?

The point is that you are trusting the SBC to perform in a manner  
consistent with the intent of sips:. By accepting the sips:  
connection, it has essentially contracted with you to comply with sips:.

If it does NOT comply with the intent of sips: and translates the  
dialog into something that isn't protected and is then "sent out"  
beyond its immediate sphere of control (its user interface, if it is  
a UA), then it has failed to honor that contract.

Well, I was actually only focusing on the PSTN GW restriction.  One can of
worms at a time as it were. :)  I actually think a layman typing in a sips
uri would be fine with it going to the PSTN.  And I think trying to make any
suppositions of their wishes beyond the sips domain is virtually impossible.


With respect to SBCs, my assumption is an SBC will keep a SIPS request
received as a UAS a SIPS request as a UAC, reject it if it cannot do so,
etc.  Unless, of course, it's specifically told to do otherwise by its
owner.  I have a sneaking suspicion that would be the case of many stateful
"proxies" too. (in fact, I know of two that can do otherwise if set to)  But
if the owner set it to be clear on the public internet, they've created a
security issue for which they would have to take some responsibility
(maybe... IANAL).  

If you just want a BCP to say "a B2BUA or SBC should keep a sips request a
sips request", with all that entails, I'm cool with that.  But throwing in a
PSTN GW, PBX, IAD, MTA, Key-system, etc. is wrong, IMHO.  It is neither Best
nor Current Practice.

Since the PSTN call could (and very well may) turn back into a sip:  
session, and we have no way to send the "please make this back into a  
secure session when you go back to IP" request over PSTN, then I  
don't think you can claim to have met the intent of sips:.

That's not to say a gateway couldn't use SIP security techniques --  
for example, it could (and should) use TLS. It just can't claim to  
have met the requirements of sips:.

[JRE] If we have a sips scheme that mandates TLS on all hops (whatever TLS
might mean) and fails if it can't achieve it, I think there is an equal
argument for a mechanism that requests TLS on all hops but still succeeds
and tells me if any hop does not meet this requirement. So if we recommend
the sip scheme for achieving best effort, it still doesn't tell me if it
succeeded. Yes, what I want would be a new mechanism, but it would not be
substantially more difficult to define than the SIPS mechanism. I am having
a hard time rationalising why we should specify an all-or-nothing mechanism
(sips) but not a best effort mechanism. In other words I am having a hard
time understanding the use cases for sips. Maybe the lack of plausible use
cases is part of the reason it hasn't been deployed much.

Since the PSTN call could (and very well may) turn back into a sip:

don't think you can claim to have met the intent of sips:.

[JRE] If we have a sips scheme that mandates TLS on all hops (whatever TLS
might mean) and fails if it can't achieve it, I think there is an equal
argument for a mechanism that requests TLS on all hops but still succeeds
and tells me if any hop does not meet this requirement. So if we recommend
the sip scheme for achieving best effort, it still doesn't tell me if it
succeeded. Yes, what I want would be a new mechanism, but it would not be
substantially more difficult to define than the SIPS mechanism. I am having
a hard time rationalising why we should specify an all-or-nothing mechanism
(sips) but not a best effort mechanism. In other words I am having a hard
time understanding the use cases for sips. Maybe the lack of plausible use
cases is part of the reason it hasn't been deployed much.

You mean doing IP address spoofing?

If you don't like impersonation, take theft of service then.

My point is that I have seen places where signalling security was a
requirement
but not media security.=20

Well, now you're going to get me started on how bad the IMS IPSec 
mechanism is.

<rant>
Its IPSEC, sure, but its keyed with a horrific 
tunnel-keys-through-SIP-register mechanism. Given the immense 
complication in designing secure keying protocols, I have a deep fear 
that there is a lurking security hole in the way keying works in IMS. 
Indeed, the specifications for this 'keying' protocol are about as 
opaque as you can make them. They are deeply buried within IMS 
specifications, bundled with lots of other stuff. This makes it nearly 
impossible for broad analysis and critique from the security community, 
which includes many folks (if not most) that would never be able to 
penetrate the IMS specifications in order to comment.

I'll also note that it is a massive layer violation; we're using an 
application layer protocol to key a security protocol over which that 
very same application layer protocol will run. Does that not simply 
strike you as absurd?

 From an implementation perspective, the IMS security mechanism is a 
nightmare. You can't use "standard" offloaders, since those assume 
standardized keying mechanisms, not this insanity of using SIP for 
keying. This makes IMS servers more expensive. You need to deeply 
integrate your IPSec and SIP stacks. Awful!!

If TCP is the stumbling block to using TLS in IMS, then DTLS to me would 
be a blessing. Nothing would please me more than to deprecate the specs 
that define this nightmare. Two in particular - the seemingly innocuous 
RFC4169 which opens the door for sip-as-a-keying-protocol, and the even 
more horrible RFC3329, which hides its real agenda of adding bid-down 
prevention to SIP-the-IPSec-keying-protocol. Once deprecated, we can 
tell 3gpp to use SIP over DTLS in R8.

Right. And all of the signaling from SIP is being mapped into some  
other signaling protocol and sent beyond a transitive trust boundary.  
The gateway simply doesn't know where its goingor what is going to  
happen "out there". Consequently, the gateway knows that it cannot  
assure transitive trust with respect to signaling integraity, and  
since it cannot insure transitive trust, it cannot use sips:.

Using sips: means "I guarantee that you can trust me to make sure  
this channel is protected to the minimal standard defined by sips:".  
If you can't meet that commitment, you just can't use sips:.

But you are defining the requirements of sips by simply
saying that any PBX on the SIP gateway is not secure.
Some people would say that the PBX is secure.

Maybe a good way around this is for SIP entities to
indicate if they came from or went to PSTN.
Then people could decide if this was good enough security
for the requirements of their call.
I still fell sips should be allowed but that sips somehow
let the use decide if the security is good enough
(just like a user can decide if HTTPS is good enough
when the certificate check fails).

I'm not saying I'm against your proposal.

I'm just saying others may view the "network boundary" to be
the IP network. It is a valid opinion.

Others may even just view it to be SIP.=20

Even if it sips end-to-end, I can have a bluetooth headset to take the
example that Paul K. had.

I could duck-tape another phone on my sip phone and do analog coupling.=20

Francois,

Well, maybe, but to the extent that I should be denied communication if TLS
on all hops cannot be achieved? I think there is an equal case for allowing
the request to succeed and reporting the lack of security.

I'm curious: what is it specifically you think you're protecting by using
sips, that DOES cross the pstn boundary, and thus would be "leaked"?  I mean
most of any info that crosses into the pstn is either deducible in sips in
some cases too, or doesn't cross, so I'm really curious what it is you think
you'd be losing.

I'm curious: what is it specifically you think you're protecting by using
sips, that DOES cross the pstn boundary, and thus would be "leaked"?  I mean
most of any info that crosses into the pstn is either deducible in sips in
some cases too, or doesn't cross, so I'm really curious what it is you think
you'd be losing.

So sip: gives us a best effort connection without a reporting  
mechanism. You want a best-effort connection with a new reporting  
mechanism. I think that's useful. I also didn't say it was a hard new  
mechanism to define, just that it's beyond the scope of a BCP to  
describe.

The use case for sips: hasn't changed (except a recommendation for  
outbound-with-TLS instead of last-hop-excepting ) , and its obvious.  
One uses sips: only when one is absolutely insistent that each SIP  
hop be protected by TLS. This is very useful for MESSAGE requests,  
registrations, presence publications, subscriptions, notifications,  
and other usages where the SIP payload is the actual communication  
being protected. It enables key-exchange within SIP for resulting  
media sessions (although DH is still a better approach). And it helps  
to obscure the media descriptions, which doesn't protect the media  
channel directly but does complicate the task of an eavesdropper.

There's clearly enough "use case" here for people to be deploying  
sips: today. Just not enough specification for making those  
deployments as meaningful as they could be.

cristian: and this gets even more confusing since at 3.4 we can read:

3.4.  SigComp_version (SV) for SIP/SigComp

   For ANY/SigComp: 0x01, as specified in section 3.3.2 of [RFC3320].

   For SIP/SigComp: >= 0x02 (at least SigComp + NACK)

cristian: I think this should clear everything up; and there should be
no doubts on whether NACK should be used or not.

since you have already mentioned sipit, here is the experience I 
have gained from the sigcomp testing done at the last one: 
clients that use dynamic compression but do not impl. NACK _cannot_ 
recover from compartment/state mismanagement (which can happen for
various reasons either at the proxy or at the client side); clients that
implement NACK _do_ recover.

bye now!

I don't disagree, but like John Elwell, you appear to be asking for a  
new reporting mechanism that is beyond the scope of informational or  
BCP documents to define.

If we extended RC 3261 to have the sort of thing you're talking  
about, then we could change the BCP to take this new mechanism into  
account.

A similar approach can be seen in my existing BCP wording, which  
basically says "Since outbound gives us a way to overcome the  
limitation that made the last-hop exception necessary, we now  
consider it bad practice to use the last-hop exception. Use outbound  
instead".

As you correctly conclude, P2P SIP has the opportunity to finally make SIP
secure.

Seems that we need a mechanism to create a trusted "channel" between
endpoints that goes through all the intermediaries. The channel should
verifiable as secure between the endpoints. After the channel is created
then the SIP signalling can go securely over the channel.

The protocol for creating such a channel may be SIP based on
external to SIP and after we have such a mechanism we can decide if we
will use SIPS for messages that need to go over the secure channel
or we will use new URI type (e.g. SSIP) or just use some
header in the SIP message.

The other alternative is the usage of S/MIME which has its drawbacks as
we can see in another thread.

Other then a secure channel or S/MIME I do not think that it will be
possible to send a SIP message and get real assurance that the message
will be sent securely in every hop.

I'm very tempted to endorse this, but I think you're missing one thing.

Flimsy as it is, I believe that sips: is as strong as the rest of the
current SIP security model since it depends on the same trust
assumptions.

We can't just restart on sips: without restarting from those
fundamental trust assumptions.

This is not trivial. Many people would argue that it would turn SIP
into a fundamentally different protocol. I think it needs to be done,
but I also think we need to clearly document how the current trust
model (including sips:) works, because that's what's going to be
deployed in the real world for a relatively long time.

The P2PSIP work is having to re-examine those fundamental trust
assumptions. My current hope is we can do some work there that can be
"ported back" into SIP.

I'm all for #2 and #3. I'm still pondering whether #1 implies that #2 is 
useless.

On #4, I think this is going to far. Please let us not make the perfect 
the enemy of the good. I really don't understand why people are placing 
this absurdly high expectations on what sips can do. As Hadriel pointed 
out, https only guarantees security to the server; where it got its 
content from - who knows.

And if you did, and you used this tape-spliced phone to downgrade  
from sips: to sip:, then what you would be doing would NOT be a "Best  
Current Practice". In fact, it would be a violation of the proposed  
"Best Current Practice" wording.

We can't reasonably design useful guns that keep you from  
deliberately shooting yourself in the head. We can, however, write  
training manuals that suggest you not do it deliberately, and we can  
write guidelines like "don't point at something you aren't planning  
to shoot" that will help keep you from doing it accidentally.

Based on the principle of "If it hurts, don't do it", Best Current  
Practice documents exist to tell people things that are likely to  
hurt and provide suggestions for alternatives that are expected to  
hurt less.

 From that perspective, translating a sips: request to something that  
is not secured and is likely to be sent somewhere else would also not  
be a Best Current Practice.

Given some of the things that can be encoded in QSIG and ISUP and  
whatnot, I'm sure there's a surprising amount of information that  
could be leaked.


let's ask the converse: If you're engaging in a telephone call that  
you expect to have sent onto the PSTN, what are you hoping to protect  
by insisting that the call fail if all the IP signaling links are not  
wrapped in TLS? Keep in mind that you KNOW that SIP elements  
compliant to Best Current Practices will encrypt everything that they  
can possibly encrypt even if you don't use sips: . . .

;-)

Actually, its the same sort of "contract" that an API or function- 
call implies.

Right. What's being lost in all of this is that receiver's ought to have 
some say in
all of this too. SIP is a rendezvous protocol, after all. To the extent 
that SIP can
affect that rendezvous and let the participants make an informed 
decision, that seems
like the right direction.

PS: is there any sort of notion of adding the transport protection 
information in Via's
       like, oh say, sendmail does with Received headers with TLS?

Without #4, then any SBC can use sips: on one side and sip: on the  
other and nobody will know that it's broken. In fact, we'd have  
documented doing so as being consistent with Best Current Practice.

Is that what you want?


The way I read it, #1 makes #4 acceptable. After all, you're going to  
get best possible security from sip: from #1 You only use sips: if  
you want the call to fail if it is not possible for EVERY hop to use  
TLS. So if you expect to gateway the call, use sip:, not sips:.

yep, that's one way to get the "What happened downstream" info back  
so the nodes can operate under "informed consent".

Of course, the SBCs that we're worried about breaking sips: also tend  
to hide the Via header fields, so it might not be all that useful.

Ok. Is it possible to put Via's in the reverse direction? Or some other 
way to inform
the originator of  the forward/backward transport path's protection 
characteristics?
If so, wouldn't that do pretty much everything you want SIPS to do 
without the
unappealing all-or-nothing problems of SIPS?

Hi,

Some editorial comments on the first parts of the draft.

Chapter 1.
----------

Q1.

The text says:

"SIP-outbound also provides a keepalive mechanism, utilizing the Simple
Traversal Underneath NAT (STUN) [5],"

I think we should say that "SIP-outbound also USES a keepalive
mechanism, utilizing...", since STUN keepalive is not part of the
SIP-outbound mechanism.


Q2.

The text, when referring to SIP-outbound, you mostly use outbound proxy
wording. I think it would be good to say that it corresponds to what
SIP-outbound calls edge proxy - or to use edge proxy also in this draft.
Currently edge proxy wording is used in Req-2 and in chapter 9.


Chapter 2.
----------

Q3.

In requirement 4, I guess the IMS IBCF could also be mentioned. An IBCF
will most likely Record-Route, while an I-CSCF may not always.


Chapter 3.
----------

Q4.

Should we put the basic outbound discovery text into the SIP-outbound
draft (I think Juha also asked this question earlier)?


Q5.

As part of the outbound discussion, I've argued that an UA should not be
mandated to establish flows through all edge proxies it is aware of. So,
the question is whether an UA MUST establish flows through each proxy
listed in the Alternative-Proxies.

As part of the outbound discussion I have also proposed the possibility
for the network to indicate in the REGISTER response how many flows the
UA should establish. I think that would be useful also together with
Alternative-Proxies.


Regards,

Christer

Keith,

I agree with the final step here, but I'm not so sure about your details 
of the intermediate steps.

In particular, I think it is too onerous to require one I-D per issue. 
FOr example it would be nice for someone to go through the bugzilla 
database and submit one I-D with all of the things in it that we need to 
put into the corrections spec. THis is more palatable than having to 
submit 30 separate documents, each 6 pages in length (5.5 pages overhead 
and 1/2 page for the useful content).

Also we need to discuss what happens when more bugs get reported after 
the correction RFC is published. DO we revise that RFC? Or issue another 
corrections document?

-Jonathan R.

Let's take your examples.

First was Bluetooth.  I agree this is a judgment call, but because I think
we're all thinking the same thing: the phone is the phone is the phone and
it's not the headset, I think it's not in the signaling path.  

Now you want to talk about acoustic coupling.  I think that one is easy.  If
both sides of the coupling are TLS end to end, then you have a poor man's
B2BUA and the sips sticker is awarded.  If one or the other side does not
maintain TLS end to end, it doesn't meet Dean's words.  I don't think there
is much of a judgment there.

Dean's proposal DOES admit to judgment calls. It's not perfect, but it's
useful.

The SIP agenda has been revised to account for a couple of things:

1) We overlap with TLS on Friday, so we swapped all the stuff  
requiring EKR to Thursday. This resulted in much juggling, and I'm  
just about as irritated as a bobcat in a clothesdryer.

2) I had incorrectly anticipated new versions of identity-coexistence  
and diagnostic responses, so I've updated the reading list to point  
at what I think are current versions.

History-Info, RFC 4244 is something like this. We're a little short  
on implementations so far, but I think it could be reasonably adapted  
to provide change-of-crypto "retargeting" info.

With the exception that you'd get an established dialog (or a MESSAGE  
request delivered) that has an unsecured connection in it, then say  
"oops".

Here's a legit use case for sips:

I want to send you a text message with moderately sensitive info. So  
I send it using your sips: request URI. If it turns out that a proxy  
out there can't honor that request for transitive protection, it  
rejects the request rather than exposing my sensitive text-bits to  
the harsh climes of an unencrypted channel.

So I still need that "I want it" part of sips. With just a post-facto  
diagnostic (like History-Info) I'd have to first establish a dialog,  
then look and see if I liked the security, then send a MESSAGE over  
that dialog (considered to be abusing the dialog by the MESSAGE RFC),  
then tear the dialog down.

But your proposal works great for the use case John and others have  
come up with -- "Ok, I've got a dialog. Now how am I going to use it?"

Indeed, but as I understand it unless it was already in an ISUP/QSIG
attachment in sips, most of the info that would be generated is not from sip
itself but defaults, or could be deduced by a sips session traffic as well
(without seeing inside).  For some cases, anyway.
And if the ISUP/QSIG info _is_ in the sips to begin with, then clearly it
came from or knows it is going to the pstn.

That's not the only converse, and I personally wouldn't send it as sips, but
for that question someone's answer could be: I would be using sips to
protect my sdesc keys for srtp, because I feel it is easier to remotely
monitor/harvest/etc. traffic on the public Internet than on the pstn, and I
want the media secured.  So I want it to fail so I know to speak in
pig-latin, or not type my pin code, or whatever.  I may have typed in a
sips:joe.dirt@kxla.com, but if it got retargeted to his cell through a
provider staying sips I don't expect them to reject the request just because
I am using sips and it would go across the pstn.

Yes. I will argue that some may want to do that. Correct.

I agree that some may want to do that as well.

That's my whole point: sips means what it means. It doesn't mean
media security, it doesn't mean "Security-with-a-capital-S", it=20
doesn't mean some icon to be displayed to the user.

It just means the hop-by-hop TLS thing that we talked about. If that is
useful for your application, use it. If it is not, then don't use it.
If it is useful only in conjunction with other security mechanism (e.g.,
media security), then do that to.

We are not doing product design here. We are doing bits on the wire.

Both Brian's and your proposal concerns me a bit. Although,
I may simply be confused about all this.

AFAIK grid is only meaningful to the entity that provided the
grid in the first place(UA that provided the grid in the Contact,
conference server etc.).

Imagine a scenario below.

1. Alice receives a call from Bob's home phone and
ua-opaque is used to identify each family member's phone in
Bob's household(sub-addresing).
2. Contact Alice receives in the INVITE has
Bob@b.com;ua-opaque=steve
3. Alice later calls Bob using the call-log but call is
redirected to Carol's house who is Bob's sister.
4. So R-URI is rewritten from Bob@b.coim;ua-opaque=steve
to Carol@c.com;ua-opaque=steve if the ua-opaque is
retained through retargeting as you suggested.
5. If Carol's house has steve as a family member and uses
ua-opaque to address each family members as Bob's house,
call will be routed towards Steve.

Now, there may be no problems with the outcome mentioned
above, but I really don't know if this is the kind of behavior we want.

Also the solution mentioned below will only address one of the
issues loose-route is trying to address(Retaining opaque value
through AoR to contact translation). The loose-route AFAIU also
tries to retain the original request target(AoR), which your solution
does not address.(Although I question why p-called-party-id can't
be used to address this issue)

Lastly I don't agree with having GRUU dependent on ua-opaque or grid
like mechanism. They both address different issues. GRUU has its place,
and grid or ua-opaque also has its place but I see no reason to necessitate
dependencies.

Shida

Hi Mike,

   My cipher-suite draft proposes the reverse channel for this purpose.

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-srivastava-sip-e2e-ciphersuite
s-00.txt

   The proposal in 3.D is sending back the least valued used
cipher-suite, but the group including EKR, agreed to send back the
complete via header.

Thx
Samir

Do you want to say that your call to SIPS URI will be only secured. If I
dial 411 etc, then we don't know. Can we convince our users with some
calls are secured, others are not.

With another wacky thread, I am still not getting convinced what we are
achieving..
In your presence publications, and registration example .. My presence,
registration can be leaked too, as there is No REQUIRE flag for not
distributing my presence,reg info to watchers on the UNSECURE channel.

Thx

So, what you're saying that PSTN gateways should use a
sip: URI with transport=3Dtls?

Can we, possibly with Requires, enforce that all hops
use the TLS?

Dean,

Thanks. During all this long thread, this is the first time that anyone has
been able to articulate a convincing use case. Messages with content, as
opposed to situations where content is sent as media, do require different
considerations. So when sending an INVITE request for an audio call, I might
be content with best effort security because I can moderate what I say if
security isn't available. But when sending a MESSAGE request I need to know
in advance that it will be sent securely or not at all.

Therefore I think I will stop trying to shoot down your trial balloon, apart
from the point about PSTN, where I believe sips stops at the UAS, whatever
that UAS is (a view that seems to be shared by a number of others). Dealing
with whatever is beyond the UAS should be outside the scope of this BCP for
sips.

I do think we need to start considering where we go beyond this, including
reporting on the security state to both UAs.

John

<rant style='my opinions only'>
In all fairness, I don't remember you or anyone else offering DTLS as an
alternative ~5 years ago when all this was specified. Nor did we have
the PSK cipher suite for TLS, which IMO would go far in solving the IMS
first-hop problem in a much, much cleaner way.

Being involved in the work you mention, I would be first to admit it's
an Utter Hack, and nothing would please me more than to see it go away.
What's worse is that the way it's being implemented and deployed manages
to lose the one bit that is actually worth something, i.e., the bid-down
protection of sec-agree. I think we managed to lay in enough bugs in
there, too, that interop is pretty horrible. But hey, live and learn.

That said, the root of all evil here is UDP. It still escapes me why
people insist on dragging that baggage around when all I see are cons
with using UDP as transport. If anything, that's a massive layer
violation to run SIP over UDP, and then replicate the state machine of
TCP in SIP. A while ago there was speculation on the SIP WG list about
defining delayed ACK for SIP to get around some weird error condition
(pardon me, the details escape me ATM). That to me would have been the
last spool that completes the reinvented wheel.

People have cited performance problems for servers having to scale up
with a huge number of TCP connections. I don't buy that. People have
cited problems with mobile handsets not being able to handle TCP. Bogus.
Even the low-end phones today handle TCP and run TLS just fine. If
someone has a phone that doesn't, well, perhaps it's time to upgrade.

What's nice about TCP is that the performance in presence of NAT tends
to be a lot better than with UDP. In wide area cellular, using UDP
keepalives will drain the battery unless you have the phone connected to
a charger. And that pretty much defeats the purpose of a *mobile* device.

So lets not forget what brought on the Rel5 security specs with their
associated problems for the IMS. It was the total lack of a viable
security solution for SIP over UDP, and the inability to use anything
but Digest as the authentication method. Today, we're not much better off.

Hi Jonathan,

   You have your right to vote and I respect your opinion.

May I ask following question

   1) How can I route the non-sip uri over the SIP network. When I need
Proxy-Require for non SIP URI's then why not use the same Proxy-Require
tag for SIP itself.=20

   2) Without any additional flag for REQUIRE tag, my presence and
reg-info is open to be sent on the unsecure channels to watchers.

   3) IMHO, Proxies and routers cannot be compared. Routers only look
into IPAddresses, where Proxies look into the complete SIP message
to,from etc .. Knowing some IP Packets going between two IP address
doesn't reveal much. But knowing To, From etc by any attacker on the
wire does mean much.

   4) SIPS doubles the entries in DNS, registrar etc.. (For SIPS, and
SIP URIS.) Whereas  Proxy-Require/Require doesn't require that.

   5) How SIPS will interwork with more workable secure solutions ? With
limited TLS (what it means still open) only, embedded with SIPS how do
you want to upgrade it for DTLS.=20

   6) If you believe in cipher-suite issue, then Proxy-Require for that
makes SIPS redundant.=20


Thx
Samir=20

Hi,

In =A73.2, it is stated that a location-by-reference URI is a pointer to =
a record on a remote node containing location of the location target.
The example in =A74.1 Geolocation: =
<sips:server5.atlanta.example.com/alice123> does not contain a valid =
sips-URI (definition provided in RFC 3261).
A sip-URI / sips-URI / pres-URI typically has the user@domain format as =
in the example of =A74.3.
So a sip-URI  / sips-URI / pres-URI typed location-by-reference URI =
refers to the presentity/target to be subscribed to in order to obtain =
the location information.
If the location-by-reference URI is an absolute URI (not sip / sips / =
pres ), then it may point directly to a record containing the location =
of the target
(e.g. https: //server5.atlanta.example.com/alice123)

Question: does the UAS or the SIP intermediary has to include the =
identity of the UAC when sending a SUBSCRIBE request to obtain the =
location information?

Some nits:
+ =A75.2 last sentence: ... is the same as the UAC as above. (not UAS)
+ =A73.2 contains contradictory statements for BYE (use of the =
geolocation header not allowed / conveying location is not defined).=20
+ application/pidf should be application/pidf+xml in Accept and =
Content-Type headers
+ civilAddress should be civicAddress
+ mind the order of the XML elements in the examples (<status> the =
beginning of <tuple>, <timestamp> at the end of <tuple>, child elements =
of <civicAddress>)
+ =A74.1: urn of gml prefix is missing

Kind regards,

Johnny

I think flexibility is needed here. Grouping of related issues, are a
number of well understood and non-controversial (but otherwise
essential) corrections is probably OK.

What we don't want to do is group things that require lots of discussion
time in the WG (SIPS fixes?) with those that don't. Nor do we want to
present two issues together such that one confuses the understanding and
WG discussion of the other.

The idea was that the reader only need read the original RFC plus 1
correction RFC. Thus as more corrections are discovered, we take the
contents of the original correction RFC, the new fixes, and produce a
new RFC that obsoletes the first correction RFC, but which still updates
the original RFC. Remember however that the draft replacement correction
RFC can still be rapidly put together - and it only needs IESG review
and approval, as all the individual components have been WGLC
separately. Therefore I see this process as being reasonably quick (in
IETF terms).

Note that in terms of the normal RFC process we would lose the
correction RFC if we ever take any SIP documents from proposed standard
to draft standard, i.e. the proposed standard RFC would obsolete the=20

Hi,

One issue that has been discussed for outbound is to allow the network
to indicate to the UA how many flows are accepted, and/or how many flows
the user is recommended to register. This value could e.g. be provided
by the registrar. Otherwise, if the maximum number of flows is reached,
registration requests would have to be rejected, which is not good.

So, my proposal is still that it should be added to outbound.

Regards,

Christer

Surely you could send some sort of NOP first? I guess that one of the my 
perhaps
not hidden assumptions here is that you are amortizing the connection 
for more
than one method being shoved down the piecewise pipe.

I guess this all gets down to whether stateless SIP is useful at all, 
which is a superset
of the "is udp useful at all" argument. I'd say that establishing a 
bunch of TCP and/or
TLS sessions is more "abusive" then just one extra e2e round trip after 
the dialog is
established -- consider the zillions of round trips just to get things 
going on a fairly
standard SIP trapezoid. If we *really* wanted statelessness, the 
messages ought to be
self-contained, which while feasible for authentication is pretty 
problematic for
confidentiality. So statelessness in combination with security seems 
unlikely to be
sucessesful to me at least. So let's just not keep investing time on it? 
I've become
pretty sympathetic to the idea of deprecating UDP over the years given 
these
realities.

Part of this for me is that SIP is just too damn complicated, and it's 
painfully
obvious that it keeps getting itself wrapped around the axle because of some
fairly high level decisions which at a high level seemed unrelated but have
proven to be vexingly difficult to unify. It would be really nice to 
just chuck
some of the decisions made mostly in a different time (cf Aki's note), and
move on given the current reality. SIPS is one of these, UDP is probably
another, and my sense is there are a whole host of things that I don't pay
much attention to that qualify too.

So I'll try to put this into a more constructive light rather than the 
whine above:
why not make a BCP which discourages the use of things known to be 
problematic
aiming at while not exactly deprecating, but end-of-life'ing those 
things so that
we have a more manageable SIP going forward? Leave the problematic things
alone for closed systems where they might be feasible, but stop 
developing for
them for open internet standards where those assumptions can't be made.

Sure you could. However, unless you bound the operation with a dialog  
(INVITE transaction, usually) there's no assurance that subsequent  
requests will follow the same path. So you might send a sip: NOP that  
would report "secure", then follow it with a sip: MESSAGE that would  
not be secured.

I don't disagree, but that sort of change requires normative change  
to standards-track RFCs, not usage guidlines.

Might be reasonable. There are limits, of course, to what one can  
change in a BCP. For example, one can say "The RFCs allow options A  
and B. A has been proven not to work, so we suggest you use B". One  
can't add a new option with a BCP. And unfortunately, we may need a  
new option in order not to run afoul of the current RFC-tangle.

Excellent rant, which could be summarized as "deprecate UDP". I think  
that's an interesting suggestion. It almost sounds like something I  
might have said myself at some timeIt would also solve our large- 
responses problem, and our "oh my god my request is too big to send  
in one packet" problem, and a bazillion other things.

It does have a bit of susceptibility to the RST DOS attack of TCP to  
think about, something that DTLS does not suffer from. But other than  
that and inertia I can think of no good reason to keep using UDP.

I'll note however that Robert reports that SIPit seems to indicate  
that most implementations are dealing with fragmented UDP just fine  
and nobody is actually noticing any problems with large packets, so  
we may be "burning a straw witch" when we worry about fragmentation.  
Personally, I'm far more worried about rampant complexity.

We possibly could, but that would be a new SIP extension, not part of  
the current sips: specification, and outside of the scope of what  
could be done with an informational or BCP document.

That would require a normative change to RFC 3261 which has=20
deprecated transport=3Dtls.

Furthermore, I think this is a bad idea to be honest. I'd rather
have the suggestion that someone made that requests with SIPoverTLS
be forwarded to SIPoverTLS by proxies.

I think we have 4 choices for PSTN Gateways:

1 - SIPS is only valid if all hops are withing a SIP network. PSTN
    gateways would therefore not use SIPS. Gateways to H.323 wouldn't
    either, even if H.323 is secured (same thing for other protocols).

2 - SIPS is valid withing an IP network. H.323 gateways could=20
    use SIPS, provided they are using an equivalent security level on
    the H.323 side. PSTN gateways gateways would therefore not use SIPS.

3 - SIPS is significant only withing a SIP network, and hop-off to PSTN
    or other networks such as H.323 ARE allowed (in the case of H.323,
it would
    require security).=20

4 - SIPS is significant only withing a SIP network, and hop-off to PSTN
    or other networks such as H.323 ARE allowed and in both cases, you
    would require the gateway network to use security.=20

I think Brian Rosen favored 4. Personally, I prefer either 1 or 2.

There are quite different however.=20

1 is my farorite choice if we think that sips has a limitted life-span
and
will have limited deployment, and will eventually be replaced by
something better.

2 is my favorite if we believe sips has a more long-term future.

Right.

I favor 2, I can live with 1.  "only valid" means fail if you can't maintain
it.  So, a gateway to H.323 acting as a UAS would fail a sips INVITE if 1
was the policy, and allow it if 2 was the policy AND it could maintain TLS
throughout the H.323 signaling path.  I'm not in favor of 3 or 4.

Brian

Is that the Proxy-Requires extension idea that you're
talking about?  I could live with that I guess.

But you'd want to make sure that if SIPS couldn't work
then SIP over TLS would be tried next then non-secure SIP.
Well, I don't know the details but I think we need a way for
PSTN to SIP users to get the best security possible.

Cheers,
Attila

Francois,

If I understand you correctly, I would favour 3. In other words, if a PSTN
gateway receives a SIPS request it should be able to accept it. Any concerns
about security within or beyond the PSTN should be dealt with by some other
(to be investigated) mechanism.

John

Hi Christer,

We have explicit consensus not to include this functionality in outbound.

thanks,
-rohan

John beat me to it. I also favor 3 (without the special case for H.323) 
because it is the only one that is really well defined. Once you get 
beyond this you are talking about the semantics of what is being 
carried, and we are going need something else to deal with that.

3 & 4 look similar to me.

One clarification. When you say pstn gateways should not use sips, what
does it mean? Does it mean that for a PSTN-SIP call, it should not use
sips even if all hops in sip network are secure? Or does it mean that it
acting as a UAS should reject a sips request?
If it is later, I agree with what John Elwell said.

I guess the problem here is whether you consider the PSTN to be secure, in
the sense of TLS, expressed in Dean's proposed wording.  If you do, then
what you propose is consistent.

Can you give me a use case where sips does something useful when one end is
on the PSTN?

I don't think anyone believes the PSTN is secure in anything close to TLS
level security.  I sort of understand the issue of the IETF can only control
the sip path, and what happens beyond is not in its purview.  Using that to
create meaningless mechanisms isn't helpful IMO.

Let's use the example cited a little while ago: a MESSAGE.  You clearly
could, at a gateway, convert that to SMS.  Does it make ANY sense to call
that secure if it was TLS from UAC to a gateway, and then over a GSM network
to a handset?  Isn't there a substantive difference between that and TLS
protected MESSAGE all the way to the handset?  What earthly good does it do
to get sips to succeed if the last hop is not secure?  I think if the
gateway knows its not the end of the signaling, then it has to fail sips if
it can't maintain TLS.

Hi,=20

>We have explicit consensus not to include this functionality in
outbound.

We do? When was that consensus reached? At least not as part of the "Re:
[Sip] Outbound-04 and "max-flow" in 200 OK for REGISTER" mail thread, as
far as I am aware.

And, no matter if we have that indicator or not, which error code shall
the registrar use if a user has reached the maximum number of flows, and
the registrar does not accept more flows?

Regards,

Christer

Ouch. Good example. I was about to endorse #3, but I think you're  
onto something here.

So far the explanation/argument of sips has been that sips is not a synonym
for human-to-human security.  It does not provide a lock icon.  It is
nothing more than a mandate that each sip hop use TLS.  It is just a uri
scheme, which behaves like a require/proxy-require for transport=tls.  It is
nothing more than that.

Your proposal is that it become more than a uri scheme for sip; that it
become a human-level request for TLS or TLS-level of "secure" (whatever that
is defined as), regardless of the protocol.  That it reaches something past
the UAS, in some higher plane.  Almost like a require that the message
headers (and really the body) not leave a cpu.  Or maybe a new scheme called
tls. :)

Don't get me wrong - I understand what you mean and why, but SIPS isn't it.
It would be a significant divergence from 3261 to define a sips uri scheme
as having such a property, to reach beyond the SIPS UAS, IMO.  The uri in
the sips request is not even the identifier of the SMS receiver.  It is the
identifier of the gateway.  If you reached that gateway using TLS, then you
succeeded.  

Does any URI or scheme mean more?  Http, https, email, ftp, etc. all
identify the server/end of the protocol, not something beyond. (an
interesting one would be tel - if there was a tels, that is) 

I think what you're really looking for is a new thing.

But that sip-sms gateway is the end of the signaling.  The end of SIP
signaling altogether.  The body contents happened to get transferred in
another protocol though.

But ok, so let's say the MESSAGE gateway sends it over email (not unlikely).
It happens to be able to get an SMTP over TLS connection to your email
server.  So it can do it, right?  Little did it know the end user uses pop3
in the clear to pull down email from that server, or that server then
forwarded it to an SMS gateway.  Or your sips-based Invite audio session was
to a sips voicemail server, but the user used sip to hear your voicemail.
What earthly good was done?  ;)

You could use SIPS to transfer something securely, in the SIP request, as
far as the UAS, for example SDescriptions.

I went thought my long list of requirements, desires, hoops to jump  
thought, and swamps to swim through that various folks have put up as  
opportunities for GRUU to "build character".

This version seems to address all of them. Congratulations. I hope we  
get to call this one done real soon now.

Cullen

What do you mean by "TLS level security"? AFAICS, sips is still meant to
work as a hop-by-hop security mechanism, much like how the PSTN works.

Can you explain how this would be any different for a web form, used via
 an https URL, that feeds a message as an SMS into the GSM cloud? i
don't see the HTTP community spending effort in figuring out how to deal
with that type of corner cases.

I think this particular monkey-wrench is not particularly interesting,
and the only thing the IETF *can* do is something along the lines of #3
in Francois' note.

Cheers,
Aki

Hadriel,

Yes, and furthermore this ties in nicely with the concepts in
draft-rosenberg-rai-phones-numbers-00, which draws a big distinction between
a tel URI and sip/sips URI. A sip/sips URI in a Request-URI addresses the
SIP resource to which you want your request to be routed, so addressing to
sips:+123456789@example.com;user=phone is effectively addressing a gateway
in example.com if +123456789 cannot be reached in the SIP network.

This time Hadriel gave the answer I would have given.

To answer Brian directly, no I don't think the PSTN is secure in the 
sense of TLS. But it does have some security properties that, at least 
on average, are better than what one gets with unsecured sip over the 
internet. Using SIPS sips to reach a GW may provide a useful tool for 
creating an end to end session that is no worse than a pure PSTN 
session. That in itself is worth something. The same is true if it is a 
MESSAGE gateway to SMS.

The SIPS itself doesn't guarantee this. It is only SIPS in combination 
with the UAs and what they do that guarantees that. But everything that 
extends beyond the UAs (including a UA that drives a UI) has such a 
dependency.

(I find the positions in this discussion to be very interesting. I find 
I am aligned with those I have often have had differences with in the 
past, and arguing with those I typically more often agree with. I have 
no idea what that means.)

A PSTN gateway does not do that. 

Again, as has been said, we'll all agree that sips is not sufficient to
solve all of our security problems, and I readily see that there are
circumstances where the security in the PSTN is considered sufficient.  I
claim that's not sips.

I find all of this slippery slopery rather fascinating. On the one hand, 
I'm being
told that SIPS is a crappy stopgap and that I shouldn't be too worried 
about the
trust implications of evil middle proxies, and other hand I see this 
amazing amount
of hand-wringing about what happens when it's outside of the realm of SIP.

Riddle me this: I assume you have no problem with a SIPS session 
terminating
on my host and that I blat out the payload to a terminal window? What 
happens
if the terminal window is, oh say, at Times Square via a handy VNC 
connection?

And I'm not agreeing with that. I think the UA in this case does what it 
does. It may do something special if sips was used, and it may not. 
While what it does may be important to the sender at the other end, it 
just doesn't have anything to do with SIPS.

As others have pointed out, this is just like HTTPS. There is nothing in 
the specification of HTPPS that requires the HTTPS server to treat the 
information it receives securely.

Based on your criteria, if a server receives a MESSAGE over SIPS, what 
may it do with it, and what may it not do with it? Can it store the 
message on a file server? Does it matter what the security of the file 
server is? How is storing it on an insecure file server any better than 
sending it via SMS?

Well, that's your problem. We probably wouldn't document it as a Best  
Current Practice, however.

So the fact that I turned it into a bunch of rectangles and sent it 
somewhere
is enough disqualify it from getting the GoodSIPSkeeping Seal of Approval?
What if I mangle it a bit first and make some SIP Haiku before I render 
it into
rectangles? Still not SIPSworthy?

Not that we're not talking about a BCP per se: we're talking about 
whether my
host should reject the SIPS message or not.

Also: from a Dev standpoint, you're presupposing that the SIP input side 
of the
call leg has any clue whatsoever as to what the output side of the call 
or whatever
else it might be will do with the message. That is think is completely 
untenable in
all but the most fixed function of devices, and even then may be 
ridiculously
difficult. Which is to say: you can specify it in some net.schoolmarm 
fashion, but
that doesn't mean anybody will obey it.

Brian, I'm a bit confused now...

Do you think that sips is usable to a PSTN gateway, or not?

Or are you saying that it depends what the gateways does with it?=20

Just to be clear, what I am proposing is that SIPS mean that there is a 
hop-by-hop TLS connection from UAC to UAS. Period. Nothing more, nothing 
less.

If one of the UAs happens to be a B2BUA, this says nothing about what 
happens on the other side. If one of the UAs happens to be a PSTN 
gateway, it says nothing about that either.

While this is pretty weak, it has the benefit of being well defined. I 
don't think we will be getting into disagreements about whether a 
particular use case complies or not.

Will it, by itself, solve any real world security problem? Probably not. 
But IMO no other plausible definition of sips will do that either.

Then we can move on and work on other kinds of security that promise 
more, possibly using SIPS as a component of the solution.

What if we turn this around?

The PSTN circuit switched world has physical security. Its users have some 
assurance that the "bits" of their phone call are delivered intact and only 
those with access to and control of the switching equipment could see or 
muck with those bits. In the packet world, we must use TLS to provide the 
same assurance because things in the clear can be seen and mucked by anybody 
with a computer. With TLS, only those with access to or control of the 
intermediaries (proxies, B2BUA, SBCs, etc) can see or muck with the 
signaling "bits". We have the a similar sort of transitive trust, although 
in the wide open Internet we may have not have the pre-established 
relationships between providers as exists in the PSTN.

The requirement for sips is at a minimum is to provide that level of 
security. Its not to equal a military secure phone. That's the next level of 
security that needs to be worked on.

Therefore, I would say, that a PSTN gateway injecting a call into the sip 
network MUST use sips to at least equal the level of security provided by 
the PSTN.

If we want a level of security that would require the PSTN to provide the 
military secure phone, that's something more than sips.

I guess that would make sips equivalent to Dean's idea of BCP SIPoverTLS. 
But I think that is what sips is today.

So, if I understand you correctly, you favor allowing SIPS to PSTN=20
gateway, regardless of what it does after, right?

I don't think this is doable.

It just means all existing SIP implementations in the world would
be uncompliant.

It could be a RECOMMENDED strenght however. But even that I think
is controversial.=20

Hi Christer,

I sent out an email to the list with the subject "Outbound issues: slide
7".  This topic was also discussed in the meeting and on the mailing list
before the meeting.

I received many, many responses supportive of leaving this functionality
out.  I have heard only one request for its inclusion (from you).

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Rohan,

I thought that slide 7 was about the discovery of outbound-proxy-set,
but that is really not the same thing.

What I am talking about is a value which is returned in the registration
response, once you have discovered your outbound proxies and sent your
first registrations.=20

I didn't even find the max-flow issue in the slides.

And, if I remember at least Erikki Koivusalo indicated that this kind of
value would be useful. I haven't really seen any objection to it on the
mailing list, but I may of course have missed that.

Regards,

Christer

Okay, so what you are REALLY saying is deprecate sips.  You admit that what
you want to do is not useful.

Right.  Come back in a year or so, and we'll have some drafts to look at.
Same old, same old.

We've been saying that for 4 or 5 YEARS.  So far, nothing which we think is
useful has been proposed.  Everything gets shut down, mostly because it
doesn't solve someone's problem they think HAS to be solved by the proposed
mechanism.

I think we can get something useful out of sips.  I think Dean did a decent
job of defining what that is.  I think it's not perfect.  It doesn't meet
everyone's needs.  It will have judgment calls to be made.

But I think it will be quite useful.

  This is what I want to avoid, which I said earlier too. The strength
of the chain is the strength of the weakest link. We will have one more
beast within SIP itself to inter-work.

If you're worried about that attack, you should be equally concerned
about a nearly-identical attack on UDP that seems apparent -- 
draft-jung-sipping-authentication-spit-00 discusses a solution, but
as I have posted earlier, if a UA expects all messages from its
proxy contain Authentication-Info, we may be able to solve the
same problem.

To be clear, DTLS does not solve the large UDP problem -- DTLS 
has support for fragmentation, but only for the TLS handshake 
itself.  We could, and maybe should, invent some framing 
so that DTLS could solve that problem, too.  Adding such framing
might be appropriate if/when draft-jennings-sip-dtls-02.txt 
becomes a WG item.

That conflicts with the conclusion of 
draft-heffner-frag-harmful-02, which is in IETF last call.

I-D/RFC formatting guidelines prohibit references in the Abstract.

No, the key idea in this specification is about oubound-initiated
flows.  STUN is a detail specified in a single chapter.

I am fine with your first two sentences.

This change just seems to add extra bulk to the spec.  I don't see how
this makes anything clearer.

All the text in this section was put there to satisfy someone.  We had
consensus on the list to go forward with the proposal I described with
respect to STUN.  I believe this section accurately expresses that
consensus and the email I sent out describing what I would do.

thanks,

Of course not; it didnt exist. The alternative was TLS and that was

The oft-cited problem is one of performance for real-time services, 
i.e., the delays in call setup that tcp would cause. I'm not enough of a 
TCP expert to know whether any of these have merit or are just bogus 
paranoia.

Sure; though even with TCP its still bad for wireless. NAT between a 
mobile device and the radio network is just an awful topology. Recently 
Dan submitted a draft which addresses the only solution I've seen that 
allows a good solution for cellular here:

One thing that really confused me about this draft was if seemed to  
use the term "congestion control" when what it actually meant "can  
deliver large packets". These seem to be two very separate things.

I think fragmentation reassembly actual does work thought most NATs.

The basic machoism seems broken. The advice that when a UAC gets a  
140 or 141 may later try with TCP does not make any sense to me. The  
UA might be able to use TCP to the first proxy but there is no way to  
tell that proxy to not use UDP to the next.

Since this approach does not work, on the topic of the other proposals

Section 4.1 - it seems this one fails in usual HERFP failure mode if  
one response is big and others are not. I think this problem should  
be mentioned.

Section 4.2 - I have no idea what you are talking about here. Can you  
explain how this option would work?

Section 4.3 - Here you send a single possible request and expect back  
a single response but if it forks you might get back the response  
plus *several* requests in reverse direction. The experience with  
early media has been three are a lot of complications with this. It  
might be the best approach but a generic description of it is pretty  
hard. I will point out this is exactly what we are doing on all the  
case where we do need large responses (i.e. SUB/NOT) so it might be  
that we basically already adopted this solution.

It was not clear to me who received the 140, what they did with it,  
or why they cared.

There is an issues about using outbound proxies discovered thought  
DHCP where it is not clear to me what we want the solution to be.  
Once we are clear on the desired behavior it is trivial to get the  
draft to provide that. Let me try to describe the problem...

If a phone has no configuration, no proxies, no aor etc and it gets  
connected to the networks and finds out a proxy name via DHCP and  
uses that to make outbound calls, I have no problem that is great.  
The question is what happens with a phone that is configured, has a  
AOR, credentials, etc.

One view is that if DHCP returns a result, you use that as the  
outbound. The argument will be made that this is the way you discover  
the proxy in the hotel that lets you traverse the firewall. But  
consider the security implications of this. It means that anyone that  
spoof a DHCP response at a wireless hot spot can force you to connect  
to them. Even if you are doing SIPS, you will pass all your signaling  
through the attackers proxy and they will be able to see it all.

Perhaps there is a part of this that I am missing but the more I  
think about it, it does not seem like you want to actually use  
outbound proxies that were discovered via DHCP.

(Note this has nothing to do with a home proxy telling you to use a  
proxy in a visited network - here someone you trust, the home proxy,  
told you to trust the proxy in the visited network)


--------

One other trivial note - when talking about the names in the  
certificates, I think the text needs to be updated a bit to cover  
certificates that have more than one name in them

Section 4.3 - Here you send a single possible request and expect back  
a single response but if it forks you might get back the response  
plus *several* requests in reverse direction. The experience with  
early media has been three are a lot of complications with this. It  
might be the best approach but a generic description of it is pretty  
hard. I will point out this is exactly what we are doing on all the  
case where we do need large responses (i.e. SUB/NOT) so it might be  
that we basically already adopted this solution.

It was not clear to me who received the 140, what they did with it,  
or why they cared.

There is an issues about using outbound proxies discovered thought  
DHCP where it is not clear to me what we want the solution to be.  
Once we are clear on the desired behavior it is trivial to get the  
draft to provide that. Let me try to describe the problem...

If a phone has no configuration, no proxies, no aor etc and it gets  
connected to the networks and finds out a proxy name via DHCP and  
uses that to make outbound calls, I have no problem that is great.  
The question is what happens with a phone that is configured, has a  
AOR, credentials, etc.

One view is that if DHCP returns a result, you use that as the  
outbound. The argument will be made that this is the way you discover  
the proxy in the hotel that lets you traverse the firewall. But  
consider the security implications of this. It means that anyone that  
spoof a DHCP response at a wireless hot spot can force you to connect  
to them. Even if you are doing SIPS, you will pass all your signaling  
through the attackers proxy and they will be able to see it all.

Perhaps there is a part of this that I am missing but the more I  
think about it, it does not seem like you want to actually use  
outbound proxies that were discovered via DHCP.

(Note this has nothing to do with a home proxy telling you to use a  
proxy in a visited network - here someone you trust, the home proxy,  
told you to trust the proxy in the visited network)


--------

One other trivial note - when talking about the names in the  
certificates, I think the text needs to be updated a bit to cover  
certificates that have more than one name in them

We are going to have to thing very carefully about the security  
implications of section 4.6 in the latest 02 version - I'm worried we  
are removing the information that would allow a downstream sip device  
to make the appropriate authorization decision - anyways - lets talk  
in San Diego.

I like section 8.

The TCP behavior seems to contradict outbound. The authors of  
outbound and reuse should get it^H^H together some time :-)

It seems that what a proxy should do when there is no alias flag is  
the same as when there is an alias flag.

There some parts of the draft I like but some parts that seem strange  
to me ...

We agree there are cases where we connect to a conical name for the  
domain and clearly this name will need to be in the cert. In some  
cases, a proxy may choose to put a different name in a record route,  
in that case we will need that name in the cert as well. Because of  
this clients need to be able to receive certs with one or more names.

A proxy needs to have a cert with the names it uses - no more, no  
less. We should not assume that a building a proxy farm necessarily  
involves record routes names that are different that the domain name  
- some do - some don't.

The trying to say if the name is URI type vs DNS type in seems  
totally orthogonal from anything this draft is trying to accomplish.  
For the stuff here, who cares, seems like either works.

Hi,

  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-psk-null-03.txt
define NULL Encryption cipher where confidentiality is not permitted.  I
don't know which geographic regions mandated it.

  Hop By hop nature of SIP might mandate the cipher exposure to it due
to the above itself ....

Thx

NULL ciphers are nothing new in TLS.

Where they are used.. If a proxy on the downstream side has to use the
NULL ciphers (due to configuration etc), then Proxy should reject the
REQUEST, letting the UAC know that request cannot be fullfilled with
Confidentiality specially for MESSAGE method.

Section 2 of the document states:

   Note that UDP fragmentation and reassembly works unless there is a
   lossy link or there is a NAT between the communicating endpoints.

but there are other cases where fragmentation breaks; see
draft-heffner-frag-harmful-02.txt.  I suggest that -heffner-frag-harmful-
should be referenced by -gurbani-sip-large-udp-response.


As to NATs working well with fragmentation, it's hard to say -- are the
fragments in question sent in order, or out of order?  (I'm told that Linux
sends fragments out of order, on purpose.)  Some NATs work just fine if
packets arrive in order (the first fragment (containing the IP header)
arrives first).  But those NATs don't work well if a fragment arrives first
-- they just drop the fragment, which means the entire IP datagram will
never be completely reassembled.  Other NATs hold onto fragments if the
fragments arrive first, hoping for the arrival of the first fragment
(containing the IP header).  BEHAVE's NAT-UDP document specified the best
behavior, but it's difficult to characterize the behavior of NATs in the
wild.

Due to UDP hops etc in between, ACK can be lost... How can you enforce
ACK not to be lost. Then you can either add Proxy-Require in ACK.. But
This will contradict the 3261
Proxy-Require rule, as ACK should have the same Proxy-Require as that of
INVITE...
In my personal opinion, all this is complex.

Additional Running code question, how many states it will introduce to
all ready complex state m/c's (170, If I remember correctly are already
there with complete PRACK, UPDATE etc... )

With Proxy-Require (tcp), providers using only UDP will start loosing
the revenue and will be forced to upgrade. My good wish :-)

The point is that 3GPP IMS tried to do the best it could with the tools
available 5 years ago, and with the requirement of supporting both TCP
and UDP. Now that we do have better tools and better understanding, I
agree that it is possible to device a better solution.=20

Yes, I think it would make sense to redefine the IMS security solution
based on TCP, TLS, and TLS-PSK. From my point of view the biggest
problem is that nowadays we have two main security specs for SIP
authentication and first hop protection, one based on TLS and another
based on IPSec. It is a burden to keep supporting both of them.

I note however, that it is 3GPP who maintains the IMS specification, so
any updates of this magnitude are subject to concensus there. But it
would certainly help, if the IETF came up with a working solution
meeting the IMS requirements.=20

I don't call myself a TCP expert either, but I fail to see any major
problem. If the UA maintains a persistent TCP connection with its edge
proxy, the initial INVITE and any furhter messages can be send and
received without any additional delay compared to UDP. Also, the
problems that TCP can have over wireless links that lose packets, do not
really show up with the kind of "lock-step" pattern that SIP has. All
messages fit into one or two packets, and then the sender waits for
something in return. So, even if packets are lost, the congestion
windows etc. do not cause much harm, since you always ever have only one
or two packets to send. It is a different thing if you'd send a big
chunk of data over SIP, but then we're not talking about real-time
anymore and besides you'd need to do that on top of a
congestion-controlled transport anyway.

True. If the wireless access provider can use public addresses, no
problem. If it can't, it can still put its *OWN* servers to the same
private address space as where the mobile hosts are. But, if some other
service provider who does not have anything to do with the access
network wants to offer, say SIP, service, then there's going to be a NAT
and the service provider can do nothing about it. (And even if there's
no NAT, it's possible that there's a stateful firewall which is nearly
as bad.) This is not a SIP specific problem at all, but is visible in
any applications requiring the host to be reachable from the network
side. SIP, however, makes things even worse by using UDP for signaling.
The best we can do is to run SIP over TCP and mux RTP/RTCP into the same
port. (And still it may not be good enough.)

Erkki,

You are right in the sense that *some* URI parameter is needed to 
distinguish between cases (1) and (2), but it needn't be the reg-id. In any 
case the specification in the current draft won't work, because the user 
part needs to be the same for cases (1) and (2).

If we consider it acceptable that high availability does not work across 
vendors, then there is no need to standardize on any particular URI 
parameter.

Regards,
Jeroen

avoidtriangular routing


  Hi Jeroen,

  But when reading the overview of the draft I came to a different 
understanding about
  the 'stickness' that this draft is trying to achieve. In order of 
decreasing preference:

  1. The specific flow used for a dialog as indicated by the URI parameters 
added into Record-Route
  2. Any flow registered by the UA as indicated by the user part of the URI 
as added to Path & S-R
  3. Any proxy within the cluster as indicated by the host part of the URI 
as in initial REGISTER

  I did not find reg-id to be significant in any of those three options. The 
instance-id (together
  with username and the selected proxies for the outbound-proxy-set) is 
sufficient to identify
  any existing flow (as for item 2).

  In which use case a proxy should be able to prefer a specific flow with a 
specific reg-id ?
  I did not find any such use case in the draft.

  Regards,

  Erkki

    Erkii,

    The idea is to create 'stickiness', to prefer using the same flow for 
all requests unless it fails. So in order of decreasing preference:
    1. Flow with same reg-id
    2. Flow with other reg-id
    3. Flow towards same FQDN (proxy cluster)

    Note that the matching algorithm I describe below is incomplete, what is 
needed is a set of rules that result in the above order of preference (in 
other words, binary equality is insufficient, we need multiple degrees of 
equality i.e. exact match, partly specific match, weak match (sam FQDN) and 
no match)

    Jeroen

      Hi,

      Actually I did not understand why the reg-id should be encoded into 
this URI at all.

      Could you please clarify the reason for its presence ? Or could the 
URI be constructed
      without the reg-id included to any part of the URI ?

        Jonathan,

        Regarding your outbound-discovery-mid-dialog draft: I believe it can 
work, but the example given in section 15 has some glitches and may result 
in sub-optimal routing.

        The backup flow from the UA x should have a different reg-id, say 
reg-id=*2* (instead of 1 as per the example in the draft). Assume there is 
also a user y registered, via proxy 1 and proxy 3. Then the connection table 
at the home proxy would look like

        TLS connection to 1:
            sip:outbound.example.com
            sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+y1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun

        TLS connection to 2:
            sip:outbound.example.com
            sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+1@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun

        TLS connection to 3:
            sip:outbound.example.com
            sip:proxy2+proxy3+x+instanceID+*2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun
            sip:proxy1+proxy3+y+instanceID+*y2*@outbound.example.com;keepalive=stun

        Consequently, when proxy 2 fails, there will be no "most specific" 
match for message 35, only least specific ones. The request should go to 
proxy 3, but the home proxy could equally likely select proxy 1 (which would 
then perform triangular routing via proxy 2).

        To have the home proxy favor proxy 3 in this scenario, I believe we 
need a URI parameter to hold the reg-id, instead of putting it in the user 
part. If we would then define that flow selection should be performed based 
on the URI from which the reg-id parameter is stripped, there would be a 
partly specific match for proxy 3 and failover would work more smoothly

        Regards,
        Jeroen

Ah, speaking as a former recreational (okay, SOMETIMES I got paid for  
it. That make me a pro?) hacker of the phone system, I have to say  
"Nope. It's just that the PSTN has a better press bureau".

For example, the way ISDN is generally deployed in the US, anybody  
can present any caller-ID number that they ant to deploy.

And anybody who can drop an inductive pickup (or even a couple of  
alligator clips) on your line gets your signaling AND your media in  
the clear.

And bored technicians sitting in LD-carrier switching junctions  
listen in on 1-900-calls (US sexy-chat services) with amazing  
frequency. Actually, they frequently step through entire banks of  
circuits sampling calls just to make sure things are working ok.  
Maybe they don't listen much, but they could if they wanted to.

You mean, "none, why bother?"

I believe that particular argument is bogus, at least within the  
bounds of IMS as currently defined. Since the TCP connection to the P- 
CSCF would be formed during registration, there should generally be  
no impact on call-setup times.

Dean,

Your mileage may vary here. In the best case TCP will be at par with UDP. 
You need a connection between each pair of hops, so for a typical case (see 
e.g. http://www.tech-invite.com/Ti-ims-sesflow-1.html) that's 6 + 1 (because 
the I-CSCF drops out) = 7 connections. Even when assuming outbound on both 
sides, the worst case still involves 5 TCP setups (sequentially).

That being said, the way things are going those INVITEs will quickly reach 
the 1300 byte limit (if not at the UA then somewhere at one of the proxies, 
see message 1f). So assuming IETF recommendations are followed, UDP won't be 
a feasible option for long.

Regards,
jeroen

Sitting back for the past two weeks and getting immense enjoyment (and
insomnia relief) from the sips: discussion, here are my consolidated
thoughts and recommendation.

THOUGHTS
========

1. sips: really, really was meant to be "Require: TLS"
   (Especially given the *suggestion* that all sip connections
    be over TLS, if possible.)

2. Unsolvable problems are unsolvable
   (Does the PSTN gateway send a call directly to a phone, which
    results in the same *expectation* of security for Joe Average
    caller, or does the gateway send a call to another gateway into
    SIP-land, in which case Joe Average caller wanted their call
    to proceed with TLS?  In the latter case, there is no way to
    signal Joe's desire, nor a way to signal failure.  That problem
    is not solvable.)

3. Francois was tasked with editing a document offering a BCP on
   sips:, not tasked with fixing sips:.

4. Joe Average user *does* assign meaning to meaningless protocol
   tokens, even if he is dead wrong
   (Domain names are opaque, meaningless strings that translate
    to IP addresses that are almost as meaningless.  However,
    people really do expect cantata.com to refer to Cantata
    Technology.)

5. Just because something is broken and old does NOT mean we should
   hack around it.  I know I am being less than practical here, but
   the IETF really should do the right thing and fix mistakes.  We
   should NOT become 3GPP and say, "We had no clue 6 years ago how
   to do it, so we guessed.  We guessed wrong, and even though no
   one has implementations yet, since we wrote it down and ratified
   it, there is no way we could possibly do the right thing."

6. Experience from messaging world:  We *learned* from the disaster
   that was https and went with explicit link security requests.  In
   other words, SAY WHAT YOU MEAN.  By the way, it makes DNS easier,
   especially if the target of a sip: request and sips: request is
   always going to be the same.

7. Experience from messaging world:  If something isn't ironclad
   clear why one needs to implement security, it won't happen.  If
   one should use TLS, unless one feels one does not need to, one
   does not implement it.
   (Why spend more on hardware and software for encryption and
    compression if I don't have to?  I get way more calls/server if
    I don't use TLS.  I can then tell my customer that sips doesn't
    do anything for them anyway, because it is trying to solve an
    unsolvable problem.  Thus I get sales because I am cheaper than
    the competition.  Competition sees this and follows suit.  Any
    surprise why sips isn't one of the more implemented features?)


RECOMMENDATION
==============

BCP should simply state "sips is hopelessly broken and meaningless.  Will be
replaced by more robust mechanism in future.  Until then, if you want to
support, for example, secure SIMPLE, it might be useful to implement it."

All of the gateway discussion, rather than being important for a BCP,
actually is critical for explaining why sips is hopelessly broken.  We can
split hairs as to whether gateways are in or out for the discussion, or how
many gatewayed-to protocols can dance on the head of a pin, but that really
does NOT get us closer to the important point of letting the world know the
reality of the meaning of sips (why we would publish ANYTHING now) or to a
better solution.

Sorry, what is the claim from the "messaging world" that https was
a disaster? "Big fat success" would have been the word I would have
used.

Looking at it from a user=B9s perspective, https is extremely successful.
Poor choice of words on my part.

The problem is confusing an application request for security services with =
a
transport indication of security services.  We now have a plethora of port
numbers and URI schemes to simply have an application request, "be secure,
now."  That is the disaster, not the user-visible feature.  Sorry that I wa=
s
not clear in the post.

See IMAP's or SUBMIT's approach to the problem of offering insecure and
secure services over the same protocol.

Hodwy,

Managed to squeeze in an update to the conditional subscribe draft:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt

Major changes include:

- Bunch of clarifications and fixes contributed by Johnny Vrancken

- Added the concept of "*" entity-tag, as suggested by Christian Schmidt

The rationale for the latter change is that it turns out if you're
suppressing NOTIFYs within the subscription, it doesn't matter what the
actual value of the entity-tag is; the superfluous notifications should
simply get suppressed by default. It is now possible by including

   Suppress-Notify-If-Match: *

to the SUBSCRIBE in subscription refreshes/unsubscribes. This has some
other interesting uses as well, like being able to do a HEAD like query
for the current entity-tag, or a heartbeat-type function to check the
liveliness of a resource (without the extra cost of receiving the
notification).

In essence, the client need not bother tracking the etags unless it is
resuming a subscription, or using polling to query the state. To me,
this is a simple addition that doesn't introduce any complexity, and
ought to be the default behavior anyway.

I'm planning to make a fairly extensive rewrite of this draft to make it
look more like an implementation spec, including adding detailed
examples and moving some of the requirements text to an appendix.

However, before I commit to that, it would be nice to get some traction
to the draft from the working group.

Is this something the SIP WG is interested in progressing as a WG effort?

Cheers,
Aki

Sorry, I don't see why this is a particular problem, outside of religion
about conserving ports.

Funny, when *I* use IMAP/TLS, I use it over a separate port.

So, let's take a step back. There are three properties you'd like to be a=
ble to
have (defined for the moment over point-to-point connections):

1. The ability to have a reference that when dereferenced you are guarant=
eed
   to get a secure connection.
2. The ability for the server to demux secure and insecure connections.
3. The ability to provide "best-effort" or "opportunistic" security
   where the peers jointly determine that they support security.

So, https: is about (1). Separate ports is about (2). There's no reason
why you can't provide protocols where there's a separate URI scheme
but that share a port for TLS and regular protocol traffic. You just
need some way to demux SSL versus not. In the case of HTTP, the
Netscape guys decided it was easiest on a different port (note that
S-HTTP used the same port). Obviously, if you want (3) you need to
run over the same port (e.g., RFC 2817), but there's also often a
need to ensure downgrade (see 1).

That's one way of looking at it. The other way is to ask why there

I too believe so. Proxies in the path mostly will keep the TCP
connections persistent between them and we are talking about
connect-reuse.

If the UAC and UAS are only reachable via UDP, then it will be only two
TCP connection setup delay. But I don't believe so as SDP is becoming
huge and huge, these two TCP connection setup will be far better than
the call failure due to loss of packets etc...
How long people will keep refraining from using Security, unless it
doesn't come with prohibiting price ?

Also with Proxy-Require (TCP), we know that it is e2e TCP, Do we need
then PRACK ? We can simplify the complex state m/c.... Offer / Answer
break ?

Thx

(As individual)

I had a brief look at this draft.

It would seem to me that proxies could be considered in networks as two
forms:

-	As edge proxies, where we have the only mechanism of routeing to
or from the user.

-	As "routeing" proxies, where the aim is to provide connectivity
from one SIP proxy to another.

For the first set, I think you need to provide some discussion in your
draft of why outbound does not support your needs, i.e. what
capabilities you do not get from outbound but which you do get from your
proposals.

For the second set, we would seem to be straying into the overall area
that touches congestion control (where out of service is an extreme form
of congestion). I would like to see some discussion of how this does not
or does relate to the mechanisms being discussed in SIPPING to support
congestion control.

Finally you have plumped straight away for a new method and header in
SIP. Why is it appropriate to use SIP to do this rather than some other
protocol running between the two entities?

I think you should also consider addressing this document to SIPPING,
and concentrating foremost on the requirements you need to fulfil rather
than the protocol solution.

Regards

Keith

Can someone clarify for me the current status of NACK in regard to
SigComp.

This draft seems to imply that it is mandatory in some form but I don't
remember any statement in other ROHC documents implying that it is
anything other than just another optional extension.

Can someone point me at some words.

Regards

(As individual)

I had a brief look at this draft.

It would seem to me that proxies could be considered in networks as two
forms:

-	As edge proxies, where we have the only mechanism of routeing to
or from the user.

-	As "routeing" proxies, where the aim is to provide connectivity
from one SIP proxy to another.

For the first set, I think you need to provide some discussion in your
draft of why outbound does not support your needs, i.e. what
capabilities you do not get from outbound but which you do get from your
proposals.

For the second set, we would seem to be straying into the overall area
that touches congestion control (where out of service is an extreme form
of congestion). I would like to see some discussion of how this does not
or does relate to the mechanisms being discussed in SIPPING to support
congestion control.

Finally you have plumped straight away for a new method and header in
SIP. Why is it appropriate to use SIP to do this rather than some other
protocol running between the two entities?

I think you should also consider addressing this document to SIPPING,
and concentrating foremost on the requirements you need to fulfil rather
than the protocol solution.

Regards

Keith

Can someone clarify for me the current status of NACK in regard to
SigComp.

This draft seems to imply that it is mandatory in some form but I don't
remember any statement in other ROHC documents implying that it is
anything other than just another optional extension.

Can someone point me at some words.

Regards

Keith

I assume you mean you dissented at the meeting itself?

I don't remember (and cannot find) any response to the minutes not being
an accurarate record of what we decided, or any specific comment by you
on list objecting to the contents of the minutes.

Whereever we are on that, I will say is that we work to rough consensus,
not absolute consensus, taking into account both the discussions on the
mailing list and in the meeting.

It is very, very clear that at the moment that we need to do lots more
work, and the INFORMATIONAL document being progressed by Francois is the
way to do that. At the end of that work we will then judge consensus on
what way forward we should go.

So I will stress that the discussion now is not about expressing
opinions. It is about capturing technical input in the INFORMATIONAL
document that can be used for the WG making decisions on sound technical
grounds on what needs to change.

Regards

Keith

I assume you mean you dissented at the meeting itself?

I don't remember (and cannot find) any response to the minutes not being
an accurarate record of what we decided, or any specific comment by you
on list objecting to the contents of the minutes.

Whereever we are on that, I will say is that we work to rough consensus,
not absolute consensus, taking into account both the discussions on the
mailing list and in the meeting.

It is very, very clear that at the moment that we need to do lots more
work, and the INFORMATIONAL document being progressed by Francois is the
way to do that. At the end of that work we will then judge consensus on
what way forward we should go.

So I will stress that the discussion now is not about expressing
opinions. It is about capturing technical input in the INFORMATIONAL
document that can be used for the WG making decisions on sound technical
grounds on what needs to change.

Regards

Keith

Dear SIP work group,

I'm on the way to implement the SIP-COMMON-MIB module (i know it is not
ready yet but hopefully small changes will apear).

I wonder about referencing the "SipTCMethodName" type as index in 
"sipCommonMethodStatsTable","sipCommonStatsRetryTable" and
"sipCommonStatusCodeTable".

maybe the sipCommonMethodSupportedIndex should be used there
or is this OCTET-STRING to use as an index? 

sorry for my unkownness,
thx and best regards

ingo franz

I think you mean "Proxy-Require: TLS"

"sips:" was originally meant as "SIP over TLS", in line with HTTP over TLS 
(RFC2818). The latter does not even contain the word "proxy", but its 
companion document, RFC2817, does.

RFC2817 defines 2 mechanisms related to https: that have so far not been 
translated to SIP:
1) The "CONNECT" method, to setup a tunnel via a proxy
2) The "Upgrade" header, to request upgrading a TCP connection to TLS 
(hop-by-hop)

I believe in particular (1) is what some people are implicitly asking for, 
as it reduces the role of proxies as men-in-the-middle and makes the TLS 
connection end-to-end.

(2) was an attempt to get rid of the different ports for http and https 
(apparently, "At the Washington DC IETF meeting in December 1997, the 
Applications Area Directors and the IESG reaffirmed that the practice of 
issuing parallel "secure" port numbers should be deprecated.", long before 
RFC3261...).

Perhaps these 2 mechanisms (1 more than 2), and an additional 
"Proxy-Require" mechanism to get "sips-or-die" forwarding behavior, would be 
a good supplement to the current arsenal?

Regards,
Jeroen

[Sip] Updated draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags






Hodwy,

Managed to squeeze in an update to the conditional subscribe draft:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt

Major changes include:

- Bunch of clarifications and fixes contributed by Johnny Vrancken

- Added the concept of "*" entity-tag, as suggested by Christian Schmidt

The rationale for the latter change is that it turns out if you're
suppressing NOTIFYs within the subscription, it doesn't matter what the
actual value of the entity-tag is; the superfluous notifications should
simply get suppressed by default. It is now possible by including

   Suppress-Notify-If-Match: *

to the SUBSCRIBE in subscription refreshes/unsubscribes. This has some
other interesting uses as well, like being able to do a HEAD like query
for the current entity-tag, or a heartbeat-type function to check the
liveliness of a resource (without the extra cost of receiving the
notification).

In essence, the client need not bother tracking the etags unless it is
resuming a subscription, or using polling to query the state. To me,
this is a simple addition that doesn't introduce any complexity, and
ought to be the default behavior anyway.

I'm planning to make a fairly extensive rewrite of this draft to make it
look more like an implementation spec, including adding detailed
examples and moving some of the requirements text to an appendix.

However, before I commit to that, it would be nice to get some traction
to the draft from the working group.

Is this something the SIP WG is interested in progressing as a WG effort?

Cheers,
Aki

Hi,

NACK support will be mandatory.

 I generally agree with Jonathan here. I don't think we should produce a
document per error. Rather, can't we take an approach that we are 
considering
for the hitch-hiker's guide? Where a single document will be updated
at certain frequency. I think from the people looking for these 
information it is
important that one can find all the errors and potential fixes in one place.
 Another approach is to have the document produced in the way it is 
mentioned
in the draft but have another document that references all the fixes in 
a similar
fashion that hitch-hiker's guide does for all the core-SIP related 
RFC/drafts.

That would be a very unlikely worst case. In general all of those 
connections, except perhaps the first and the last, will typically be up 
all the time. And if outbound was used for IMS then the first and the 
last would also be up all the time the UAs are able.

Its possible that some freakish set of circumstances could conspire to 
result in needing 5 sequential setups, but such a case is likely to be 
in calamitous situations.

I dissented at the minutes of meetings which were emailed on the
response of Mat. Refer

http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg16008.html

Personally I agreed to contribute with the text in Francois's document,
why SIPS is broken.

In the meeting on the slides of cipher-suites, there was a question
"Should we clean up the mess of SIPS" and I was told by everybody that
we had CONSENSUS on keeping SIPS.
There was nothing for me to say on that.

Anyway people know it is broken within the time.

Thx
Samir

That's because you're trying to make it solve problems it isn't meant to
solve (indeed - it is just meant to diagnose problems, not solve them).

The system sending the large response has no new states - it sends the
141 and forgets about it.  A system that receives a 140 or 141 could
decide to remember that fact and slow or reduce retries, or change
transports, but it's not required to do so.

It doesn't work that way.

Perhaps, but the argument was that TCP was unsuitable for mobile use  
because of the unsuitability of TCP on the last-hop mobile phone  
link. I think we now have ample evidence to refute that part of the  
argument.

Rohan:

After reading through the new section in outbound relating to SigComp 
(section 8.2), I have two small comments.

The first is that STUN messages don't have any way to convey SigComp 
compartment information. This is almost certainly okay, since the 
document says to carry them using the "well known shim header," which 
doesn't result in any attempt to create state. To avoid confusion, you 
should add a paragraph to the end of the section reading something like:

   Because the bytecodes expressed in the well-known shim header do not
   store any state, correlation of such SigComp requests to a
   compartment is not necessary. To avoid ambiguity, we add the
   following requirement: any SigComp state that may result from a
   message that, once decompressed, turns out to be a STUN message,
   MUST be discarded.

Also, you cite the shim as coming from RFC 3320. In fact, it comes from 
the implementors' guide, which in in WGLC: 
draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-impl-guide-08.txt.

...and in draft-gurbani-sip-large-udp-response-00, it means "Use

I'd offer to move mine somewhere else, but it's been published as an RFC

Jonathan,

Major comment:

Section 3.2: "Only when the contact expires, either through explicit
de-registration or timeout, will all of the temporary GRUUs be invalidated."
So how many temporary GRUUs does the domain proxy need to remember? If a UA
remains registered for a year, say, and refreshes its registration every
hour, say, that is a lot of storage.

Minor comments / nits:

Section 2: "remote target: The term "remote target" refers to a URI that a
user agent uses to identify itself for receipt of both mid-dialog and
out-of-dialog requests." This doesn't seem to be consistent with RFC 3261,
where a remote target doesn't identify the UA itself, but a remote UA.

Section 3: "GRUUs are issued by SIP domains and always route back to a proxy
in that domain." This is not always true now that UAs can provide their own
URIs with GRUU properties, as described in 3.2.

Section 3.4 on dereferencing a GRUU: "Because a GRUU is simply a URI, a UA
dereferences it in exactly the same way as it would any other URI.  However,
once the request has been routed to the appropriate proxy, the behavior is
slightly different...." A UA-assigned GRUU will be an exception to the
procedures in this paragraph.

Section 4.1 on generating a REGISTER request: 'Each such Contact header
field SHOULD NOT contain a "pub-gruu" or "temp-gruu" header field.' Change
"header field" to "header field parameter" or just "parameter".

Section 6.1 on request targeting: "If there are no registered contacts bound
to the GRUU, the server MUST return a 480." I believe this can apply only to
public GRUUs, since temporary GRUUs disappear when registration ceases, so
the proxy has no way of knowing whether this was previously a valid
temporary GRUU. Hence I would have expected a 404 rather than a 480
response. I think some clarification in the area might be beneficial.

Section 6.1 "In many cases, the new request is related to an existing
dialog, and may be an attempt to join it (using the Join header field [23])
or replace it (using the Replaces header field [24])." The request could
also relate to an existing dialog by means of RFC 4538.

If you choose to implement this by literally storing GRUU, then yes, its 
a ton. But you wouldn't do that. It is far easier to implement this by 
constructing them algorithmically. This can be done with no additional 
storage (there is an algorithm in the annex), and there are several 
variations that require fixed storage per user (one integer) that can 
produce much shorter URI.

Its a good question; I think the answer depends somewhat on whether 
these tel URI get quickly translated to sip or whether they hang around 
(see
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-rai-phone-names-numbers-00.txt)

I think you would need involvement of Route headers with sips URIs in 
these cases.

Why? Use sips URIs for those.

I don't see how this point is relevant to the discussion.

True.

I am in the camp that views DTLS as equally OK as TLS/TCP. That is, the 
requirement is on the security mechanism, not the transport protocol.

I do not believe in the need to signal or convey the cipher-suites.

One comment here on process.

I really don't see the value in an informational document at this point. 
I'd rather write a draft on what the solution ought to be, whatever that 
is, and have it be normative. I see little value in producing a document 
that informationally describes that, just to be followed by yet another 
which provides the normative version of that.

(As SIP WG chair)

See http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters for a list of
currently assigned response codes (with 489 allocated already as Adam
indicates).

As definition of a new response code requires a SIP WG document, can I
suggest that only such documents make any attempt to assign a response
code value - I know this can be useful because the examples have to show
it. If your document is not one of these, use 4xx or something else that
can be replaced later.

I notice also drafts in SIPPING group attempting to assign response
codes.

Regards

Keith

Dean,

I've just done some measurements. This is in no way representative or 
statistically significant, but what I get on my PDA (Windows Pocket PC 2003) 
on a commercial Dutch operator GPRS network (no NAT) connecting to my home 
grown proxy at home (on ADSL and then behind NAT):

start-REGISTER-401-REGISTER-OK-end (starting with GPRS off, SIP UA detects 
IP assignment and registers, times measured at UAC):
UDP : 2-3 seconds (T1=2 seconds, no retransmissions occur)
TCP:  ~1 second connection setup, then 2-3 seconds
TLS: ~3 seconds handshake, then 2-3 seconds (without cert checking etc)

In all cases, a re-REGISTER sequence has similar timing.

In other words: for my environment, once the connection is up, round trip 
delay differences are indeed negligible

Regards,
Jeroen

If M5 PUBLISH uses the SIPS URI, while in M1 WATCHER uses just the SIP
URI. Should we just leave the intermediary to distribute the presence on
the unsecure channel. IMHO, PUA should have the control for the security

Perfect. I too believe that we should not pose any limit on the secure
protocol to be used. I believe in separate header for describing the
complete secure protocol properties clearly, instead of embedding them
like SIPS means TLS over TCP in 3261.

NULL encryption ciphers provide no confidentiality.  There are some
geographic regions where confidentiality is not permitted. (Pl correct
me if I am wrong) UAC need to know when his request is not given the
desired level of confidentiality. Here we cannot rely on the mandatory
ciphers. In this case UAC request should be failed by the proxy with
some 4xx, if downstream hop doesn't provide confidentiality. Then UAC
may resubmit.=20

There was earlier discussion on Cheater Proxy , Trust and Verify etc for
its motivation.

Having a well defined mechanism of Secure-Protocol with properties is
more future proof.
After 3261, we found DTLS now we want to put DTLS. IMHO, similar can be
for ciphers.=20

HK> If you want a UAC to control who gets to see its presence, that should
be a package of/within presence, not a URI scheme or require of the
subscribe or publish or whatever.  The PUBLISH was addressed to the server,
and it got there.  If you use SIPS it will (hopefully) get there over TLS.

HK> I am in the exact opposite camp.  I don't think an application protocol
header should specify the transport type at all to be used for
forward-routing by other nodes, let alone the intricate details of that
transport.  Do you expect to specify whether it can be UDP, TCP, or even the
MTU as well? :)

Encryption mechanisms in particular would be bad for this.  There are so
many optional/alternate components, that for a UAC to describe all the sets
it will "allow" all proxies to use for transporting its message is just not
practical.  There's a reason negotiation mechanisms exist for encryption
protocols, and even with them we have mismatches/failures.

SIPS and SIP rely on trusting the proxies in the middle.  If you don't trust
them there's no point in adding more headers/checks when they can lie about
any/all of them.  If you DO trust them, then trust them to do the right
thing.  What they need from the UAC is to know whether the message is
sensitive enough that it should not be forwarded if a secure next-hop path
is not available.

I wonder if perhaps we need an shadow registry for SIP. It would hold 
new values that are being used in drafts until they become RFCs, after 
which they would go in the official IANA registry.

(Would be better yet if IANA would do that for us, but that may be too 
much to expect.)

While I really dislike being so pedantic, I added your proposed text.

actually we were both wrong.  The well-known-shim is defined in:
   draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-sip-03.txt.

I hope it is OK that this is an informative reference.

Cool. Thanks.

That matches with my own informal observations.

Uh, no.

I'm actually somewhat aware of the contents of the drafts I co-author.

The shim is in draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-impl-guide-08.txt.

Gonzalo copied it into draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-sip-03.txt due to some 
uncertainty on his part about the status of
draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-impl-guide-08.txt.

It will be removed in draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-sip-04.txt, never to reappear.

You *REALLY* want to cite draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-impl-guide-08.txt

I promise.

Hi Rohan,

Without commenting individual replies you gave, my main issue is that I
want to be able to use STUN keep-alive without having to implement/use
outbound, and I want that to be clear in the spec.

So, if I only want to implement STUN keep-alive, and read chapter 8, I
shouldn't have read or implement outbound, and I think that should be
clearly indicated in the spec.

Regards,

Christer

You raise an excellent point, Cullen. This is actually a pretty 
fundamental architectural issue that we need to discuss. Its much 
broader than the outbound discovery draft.

The question is - if I'm "roaming" and my SIP UA finds itself in the 
domain of another IP access network provider (like a  hotel), do I need 
to use its SIP services in order to communicate back to my home network? 
I think we've had this model for a long time that said you did, for 
things like firewall traversal and maybe even visited QoS authorization. 
The "hotel" proxy has been a staple of SIP thinking for a long time.

However, there are several issues here:

1. first and foremost, I think the idea tha a visited *access* provider 
even needs to have application layer proxies (like a SIP proxy), is 
anathema to the entire IP model. The idea with IP is to separate access 
for applications. I should be able to get the SIP services from my SIP 
provider without the access network even knowing how to spell SIP.

2. With technologies like ICE, we have far better solutions for firewall 
traversal. The visited network (a hotel for example), could deploy a 
firewall, and black inbound packets unless a pinhole is opened from 
inside to out. The STUN checks would create such a pinhole, and it would 
not require any application layer intelligence in the firewall.

3. the issue Cullen has raised, whereby there is no trust with the 
visited network. Why would I include some unknown random proxy on my 
signaling path? They have no right to see my signaling, any more than 
they would have a right to view my web browsing.



If folks agree to that, its not clear what to *do* about it. To some 
degree it implies we need to deprecate the entire usage of DHCP for 
discoverying proxy servers....

WHAT:     Tutorial on Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
       (http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-12.txt)

WHEN:     Tuesday, November 7 1130-1300

           Lunch will be provided at a nominal fee of $10
             Sandwiches, salad and chips
             Bring-your-own beverage

           Please get me your $10 prior to the end of the IETF meeting.
           Only 90 lunches have been ordered, its first-come-first-served

           I am covering this out of my own pocket, so please do get me
           your $10 if you partake of the food. I'm not tracking who eats
           or pays - we're on the honor system here!


WHERE:    Grande Ballroom A

WHO:      Anyone with an interest in RAI work that would like to learn
           more about ICE.

WHY:      ICE is one of the 'core' SIP specifications (according to the
           SIP hitchhikers guide) and seeing some good adoption. It's the
           IETF tool for NAT traversal for SIP-based media. However,
           it's a complex specification. The tutorial will assume only
           basic familiarity with SIP, SDP and NAT, and explain the rest.
           Participants will emerge with a high level understanding of
           the operation of ICE. The tutorial will be based on the
           pending -12 version.

RSVP:     Please send a note to me with the Subject line "ice-is-nice"
           (mailto:jdrosen@cisco.com?Subject=ice-is-nice).

Thank you very much for the comments.
We will be working on Draft to make it clearer with the comments=20
Incorporated.

We will also address the Draft for comments in the SIPPING.

Subject: RE: [Sip] Draft for review:draft-sreeram-specify-method-00.txt

(As individual)

I had a brief look at this draft.

It would seem to me that proxies could be considered in networks as two
forms:

-	As edge proxies, where we have the only mechanism of routeing to
or from the user.

-	As "routeing" proxies, where the aim is to provide connectivity
from one SIP proxy to another.

For the first set, I think you need to provide some discussion in your
draft of why outbound does not support your needs, i.e. what
capabilities you do not get from outbound but which you do get from your
proposals.

For the second set, we would seem to be straying into the overall area
that touches congestion control (where out of service is an extreme form
of congestion). I would like to see some discussion of how this does not
or does relate to the mechanisms being discussed in SIPPING to support
congestion control.

Finally you have plumped straight away for a new method and header in
SIP. Why is it appropriate to use SIP to do this rather than some other
protocol running between the two entities?

I think you should also consider addressing this document to SIPPING,
and concentrating foremost on the requirements you need to fulfil rather
than the protocol solution.

Regards

Keith

Using 4xx can be confusing as there will be no way to know if it is an
yet unassigned specific response code in the 4xx class or the whole 4xx
class.  May I suggest 4?? instead?

the idea of using visiting network's sip resources is completely bogus
and so is dhcp configuration of sip ua.  the idea of using visited
network's sip resources is yet another bad idea that 3gpp has adopted
for the sole reason of being able to milk the cow as many times as
possible.  in order to support dhcp free configuration of sip ua, we
should have included jonathan's outbound autodiscovery mechanism in
outbound, but for some reason, some people didn't agree to it.

Hi,=20

>If you're only interested in chapter 8 (and you're probably=20
>not alone), wouldn't it make more sense if the STUN,=20
>keep-alive usage were described in a separate draft?

Well, that is what I proposed before, when commenting outbound-04.=20

But, the decission that seems to have been made at some meeting was to
keep it in the outbound draft. And I can live with that, as long as it
is clearly separated from the outbound mechanism, which I don't think it
is - eventhough the addition of chapter 8 IS a good improvement from
outbound-04.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I am attempting to tighten up our SIP stack's behaviour regarding which =
URI parameters/fields to display/hide in header fields. This quest led =
me to a table known as "Table 1" in section 19.1.1(?) of RFC 3261. This =
table seems to present whether or not fields such as port and transport =
are optional or mandatory in headers, such as the "Contact" header. My =
understanding of this table leads me to believe that the only mandatory =
field for all header categories is the host address - that's why an 'm' =
character only appears in the "host" row.

So, apparently, all of the other fields are either optional or not =
allowed. Surely this constraint only applies when those fields have a =
their default value? What happens if a field assumes a non-default =
value, surely then the presentation of this value becomes mandatory in =
some header field somewhere?

Could someone clarify how, if at all, this table is to be interpreted =
regarding non-default values for URI parameters/fields?

thanks
Matt  =20

Whatever keeps it from assigning digits.

The key point is that nobody is supervising all these selections made by
individual author drafts, and we even find conflicts in working group
items, and therefore if someone is trying something in an
implementation, they are guaranteed to get a conflict if that usage
survives for any length of time.

I believe this is a sip-implementors questions.

Besides, I do not understand the question. host is only parameter in a
sip url, if there are other parameters needed they can be added. For
example if a sip Invite terminates on a pstn gateway, a user portion,
which identifies the pstn user, will be required

	I am attempting to tighten up our SIP stack's behaviour

This quest led me to a table known as "Table 1" in section 19.1.1(?) of

Hi,

I have a couple of comments on the current Outbound draft. These have
nothing to do with the normative behavior, but would be useful additions
from information/motivation point of view:

- Section 3.3 discusses why multiple connections are good for
reliability. The main motivation there is that multiple connections to
separate proxies protect against the failure of an individual proxy. An
additional motivation, which is currently missing, is related to
multihomed UAs. Such UAs would benefit from multiple connections from
different interfaces (or IP addresses) even if there is only a single
outbound proxy. This would protect against the failure of an individual
access link or the path between the particular interface and the proxy.
For instance it is quite realistic that in a few years there are many
UAs that have both cellular wireless interface (3G, WiMAX, ...) and a
WLAN interface, and whenever there is a WLAN available, they could be
multihomed and have a separate SIP registration/connection from each
interface. In the wireless access the risk of the access link/coverage
going down is quite big, so the benefit would be real.

I believe the current outbound mechanism supports this scenario already,
but it would be good to explain it in Section 3.3 as another reason for
doing mulitiple connections. I suppose q-values can be used to inform
the proxy which connection the UA prefers (for instance the one using
WLAN)?

- Section 4.4 has some discussion on why some
implementations/deployments might want to use a larger value for TCP
keeplive timer than the default 95-120 seconds. The main reason offered
is that the load on the servers might be too excessive. Another, perhaps
even more pressing, reason has to do with wireless devices. In many
cellular radio networks the frequent keepalive traffic will drain the
battery of the devices quite fast, so they would like to send the
keepalives as rarely as possible.=20

Again, the spec allows higher values (bounded by the actual NAT/FW
timers, of course), so this is not a problem, but it would be good to
add this consideration explicitly in the draft.

If the authors and the WG see these as useful additions, I can propose
some specific text for both cases.

Regards,
	Markus=20

Adam,

Fixed.

It would be extraordinarily helpful if section 11 of
draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-impl-guide actually included the term
"well-known shim".

(As WG chair)

There are a set of slides at the IETF#67 presentations site as below.

http://www3.ietf.org/proceedings/06nov/slides/sip-1.pdf

These are the WG chairs view of the current status of the work within
the SIP WG.

At the WG we will probably do no more that present the cover sheet, and
ask for any questions, points of view or whatever on any of the
documents covered for which agenda time has not been allocated.
Therefore if you wish to understand this discussion - you will need to
have looked at the slides beforehand.

This has to be brief, as we need to get on to the agenda items that have
been requested. Alternatively, feel free to use the mailing list.

Regards

Keith

Keith,

Concerning connected-identity, there is one major issue that was not fixed
in draft 02 (which otherwise has all the fixes from WGLC). There was some
discussion on how to fix that and this is the sole thing I will cover during
my presentation (slides will be available soon). From off-line discussions
so far this week, I am hoping that the resolution will be simple, but let's
see.

John

Hi,

I think this is a useful optimization for SIP events in general, and
definitely needed for Presence.=20

The main problem in deploying SIP presence in wireless networks is still
that the amount of traffic it generates is too large. Even if the actual
state changes were infrequent, the subscription refreshes can generate a
lot of traffic, as each refresh triggers a full-state NOTIFY. The
partial notification mechanism in SIMPLE does not help with this, since
it does not apply to refreshes. It is of course possible to increase the

besides helping with the refreshes, this draft is helpful in polling and
re-subscriptions after connectivity breaks.=20

The proposed mechanism seems relatively simple, so complexity should not
be an issue. Also, as this is a backwards compatible extension with
support negotiation, no-one is forced to implement it if they think it's
not useful for them.

So, I strongly support adopting this as a WG item.

For the further work, I think it would be essential to clarify how this
works with the resource list mechanism, as people would like to use the

Hi,

currently, performance load caused by Presence service is very=20
difficult to predict. Any method to avoid redundant traffic
(without adding much complexity and decreasing functionality)
is useful. This is the case for this etag draft. Therefore I
also support, to adopt this as a WG item.

Regards
Christian

Betreff: RE: [Sip] Updated draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags

Hi,

I think this is a useful optimization for SIP events in general, and
definitely needed for Presence.=20

The main problem in deploying SIP presence in wireless networks is still
that the amount of traffic it generates is too large. Even if the actual
state changes were infrequent, the subscription refreshes can generate a
lot of traffic, as each refresh triggers a full-state NOTIFY. The
partial notification mechanism in SIMPLE does not help with this, since
it does not apply to refreshes. It is of course possible to increase the
subcription refresh interval, but that has its tradeoffs too. And
besides helping with the refreshes, this draft is helpful in polling and
re-subscriptions after connectivity breaks.=20

The proposed mechanism seems relatively simple, so complexity should not
be an issue. Also, as this is a backwards compatible extension with
support negotiation, no-one is forced to implement it if they think it's
not useful for them.

Betreff: RE: [Sip] Updated draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags<br>
<br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
I think this is a useful optimization for SIP events in general, and<br>
definitely needed for Presence. <br>
<br>
The main problem in deploying SIP presence in wireless networks is still<br>
that the amount of traffic it generates is too large. Even if the actual<br>
state changes were infrequent, the subscription refreshes can generate
a<br>
lot of traffic, as each refresh triggers a full-state NOTIFY. The<br>
partial notification mechanism in SIMPLE does not help with this, since<br>
it does not apply to refreshes. It is of course possible to increase the<br>
subcription refresh interval, but that has its tradeoffs too. And<br>
besides helping with the refreshes, this draft is helpful in polling and<br>
re-subscriptions after connectivity breaks. <br>
<br>
The proposed mechanism seems relatively simple, so complexity should not<br>
be an issue. Also, as this is a backwards compatible extension with<br>
support negotiation, no-one is forced to implement it if they think it's<br>
not useful for them.<br>
<br>
So, I strongly support adopting this as a WG item.<br>
<br>
For the further work, I think it would be essential to clarify how this<br>
works with the resource list mechanism, as people would like to use the<br>
two mechanisms together. <br>

&gt;Subject: [Sip] Updated draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Hodwy,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Managed to squeeze in an update to the conditional subscribe draft:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt=
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Major changes include:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;- Bunch of clarifications and fixes contributed by Johnny Vrancken<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;- Added the concept of &quot;*&quot; entity-tag, as suggested by <br>
&gt;Christian Schmidt<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The rationale for the latter change is that it turns out if <br>
&gt;you're suppressing NOTIFYs within the subscription, it doesn't <br>
&gt;matter what the actual value of the entity-tag is; the <br>
&gt;superfluous notifications should simply get suppressed by <br>
&gt;default. It is now possible by including<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp; Suppress-Notify-If-Match: *<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;to the SUBSCRIBE in subscription refreshes/unsubscribes. This <br>
&gt;has some other interesting uses as well, like being able to do <br>
&gt;a HEAD like query for the current entity-tag, or a <br>
&gt;heartbeat-type function to check the liveliness of a resource <br>
&gt;(without the extra cost of receiving the notification).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;In essence, the client need not bother tracking the etags <br>
&gt;unless it is resuming a subscription, or using polling to <br>
&gt;query the state. To me, this is a simple addition that doesn't <br>
&gt;introduce any complexity, and ought to be the default behavior anyway.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I'm planning to make a fairly extensive rewrite of this draft <br>
&gt;to make it look more like an implementation spec, including <br>
&gt;adding detailed examples and moving some of the requirements <br>
&gt;text to an appendix.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;However, before I commit to that, it would be nice to get some <br>
&gt;traction to the draft from the working group.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Is this something the SIP WG is interested in progressing as a <br>
&gt;WG effort?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Cheers,<br>
&gt;Aki<br>

I'd like to confirm my full support expressed in a former mail to adopt
Aki's document as a WG item.
As Markus stated, it is important to clarify how the proposed mechanism
can be combined with other optimization techniques.

Subject: [Sip] RFC 3261 Ambiguous SIP URI table in 19.1.1



Hi,=20

I am attempting to tighten up our SIP stack's behaviour regarding which =
URI parameters/fields to display/hide in header fields. This quest led =
me to a table known as "Table 1" in section 19.1.1(?) of RFC 3261. This =
table seems to present whether or not fields such as port and transport =
are optional or mandatory in headers, such as the "Contact" header. My =
understanding of this table leads me to believe that the only mandatory =
field for all header categories is the host address - that's why an 'm' =
character only appears in the "host" row.

So, apparently, all of the other fields are either optional or not =
allowed. Surely this constraint only applies when those fields have a =
their default value? What happens if a field assumes a non-default =
value, surely then the presentation of this value becomes mandatory in =
some header field somewhere?

Could someone clarify how, if at all, this table is to be interpreted =
regarding non-default values for URI parameters/fields?

thanks=20

No.  This table only describes what forms are syntactically valid.  It =

Your question is whether or not omitting a non-default port value is =
semantically valid or not, to which the answer is 'No'.

Yes, that's right, I'm glad that someone understood my question.

It's a shame, IMO, that RFC 3261 does not clarify this a little better. =
For example, suppose I have received a Record-Route =
"sip:192.168.2.1:5067", is it necessary to include the port =
specification in the Request-URI and/or the Route-set? The answer to =
that question is not inferred by the mentioned table and surrounding =
text.

thanks

RFC 3261 does clarify this, but not in that section.  You might find it
useful to look at Sec 19.1.4, and note that "sip:192.168.2.1:5067" is
not=20
equivalent to "sip:192.168.2.1".  If the URIs are not equivalent, then
in some sense they refer to different entities. =20

As a general rule, URIs should not be 'adjusted' as you work with them.
If
you make a change that would cause the tests in sec 19.1.4 to deem the
new
URI not equivalent to the old URI, then you can expect interoperability
problems sooner or later.

Michael

Ok, my mailbox is completely filled with requests begging us to  
sponsor this poor homeless child-draft that is apparently starving to  
death in some third-world blight-zone refugee camp and desperately  
needs our help. I didn't know Sally Struthers was active in the IETF,  
but I'm fairly sure I saw an infomercial on late-night TV where she  
too was asking for help with this draft.

So lets put the question another way:

Are any of you people OPPOSED to adopting draft-niemi-sip-subnot- 
etags as a deliverable of the SIP working group?

If you don't want us to work on it, please speak up. If you do want  
us to work on it, SAY NOTHING, since if all you people who want us to  
work on it send an email, we won't get any work done because I'd be  
too busy filing your emails away . . .

Maybe you are looking at the wrong place. For the example mentioned =
above, to create the request-uri, you should be looking at sec. 12.2.1.1

Pretty much, except the alias flag makes the intention more explicit,
and may be helpful during debugging to understand the behavior.

And just to be absolutely clear.

We assume that:
	wanting us to work on it, and
	the idea is so broken as to be unfixable

Are incompatible and noone would want us to thrash ourselves to death
going down that path.

So this invitation to speak up does include any view that the idea is

SIP

I'm working on the ABNF of the Geolocation header for SIP location 
conveyance, and have discovered a means of indicating which entity 
(currently by type) inserted the location *at*that*URI*, per URI in the 
header  (i.e. this will be a header parameter, not a URI parameter).

For example, if a SIP message includes location-by-value, the Geolocation 
header would have a "cid:" URI that can have a header parameter to indicate 
whether the original phone ( SIP UAC) inserted the by-value location, which 
would be different than if an intermediary server (say a SIP proxy) inserts 
location by-reference.  Here, the Geolocation header would have a reference 
URI, which can indicate that a intermediary (and not the original phone) 
inserted the location.

Here is an example in which there are two locations in a message:

    Geolocation: <cid:alice123@atlanta.example.com ;inserted-by=uac>,
                 <sips:3sdefrhy2jj7@lis.atlanta.com ;inserted-by=proxy>

The above header has 2 locations (one by-value, inserted by the phone) and 
one inserted by a proxy along the signaling path.

An interesting facet of this is the ability to indicate which location the 
message was routed on if a message has multiple locations.  I know this has 
been asked for over the years in both Geopriv and ECRIT. Here is what that 
additional header parameter could look like (notice the "message-routed-on" 
parameter associated with the location-by-reference):

    Geolocation: <cid:alice123@atlanta.example.com ;inserted-by=uac>,
                 <sips:3sdefrhy2jj7@lis.atlanta.com ;inserted-by=proxy
                 ;message-routed-on>

This plays directly to the open issue we have had for some time in the case 
of more than one location within a message, answering "who inserted which 
location?" and "which was used to route the message?".

[ BTW - I'm posting similar messages to this one on the GEOPRIV, ECRIT and 
SIP lists, but not doing one large cross-posting message - as this idea has 
to get multi-list visibility]

Is this a desireable feature/function (indication)?

James

I'm looking for feedback on the idea of adding text to the SIP Location 
Conveyance -06 ID discussing the use of a Content-Disposition header for a 
location received.

Should this header be in a SIP message that contains location intended for 
the user recipient (verses a proxy that will route on the location value, 
in which "render" doesn't apply)?

If not, the default value for the Content-Disposition header is "render" I 
believe.

Does this need to be explicitly stated in this next rev of the doc?

If "render" is not the (or an) appropriate action (meaning there may be 
multiple actions to take by default), which other Content-Disposition 
header-values should be mentioned in this doc?

I've had one request for "attachment" to be offered for use if location is 
included in a MESSAGE request, offering the UAS user the choice not to have 
the received location automatically displayed, but have them have to take 
an action to display hte location received.

Is this a valid use of the Content-Disposition header here (meaning, does 
it make sense to offer this scenario in the ID)?

And, are there any other Content-Disposition header-values that make sense 
to articulate in this doc?

Comments are requested

James

The question was on clients I thought; this is easy for clients to 
obtain since it requires no extra messaging or work for them.

On the server side it requires no more additional write operations than 
is already done for a register refresh.

Jonathan,

Apologies if these comments have already been made.

Section 1 "When the request arrives at the terminating UA, it first checks
for the Identity and Identity-Info header fields. If present, the identity
in the From header field is used as the caller ID." - The problem here is
that if there is a B2BUA in the terminating domain, verification by the UA
is likely to fail.

Section 5 "Similarly, in cases where a proxy serves as a B2BUA and an
ingress proxy, it MUST perform the B2BUA function after the ingress
functions described here." Performing a B2BUA function will invalidate the
Identity header, leading to the problem above.

Section 8, Benefits: "Works in the presence of B2BUAs in the originating and
terminating domains." Well, it only works in the presence of a B2BUA in the
terminating domain if the UAS receives PAI and is prepared to use that in
the face of an invalid Identity header.

Section 8, Benefits: "Provides the cryptographic strengths of SIP identity
to the terminating domain, so that mechanisms such as spam detection can be
effective." OK, to the terminating domain, but not necessarily to the UAS.
Also, not even to the terminating domain if there is an intermediate domain
that uses a B2BUA.

John

I was going through this draft and it defines MIBS for SIP Method names and
SIP option tags. 

I was wondering why there is no MIB for listing event packages defined in
various RFC's as per RFC 3265?

Dale,

I found your draft while looking for REFER+Replaces information, and I 
think it's great to have a documentation stating potential usages of REFER.

But there's one thing that's still unclear to me. How the REFER 
recipient can distinguish whether to send request (specified in the 
method param of Refer-To target) *inside* or *outside* dialog context. 
Or for that matter, whether this is something that the REFER recipient 
should care about at all (I think it should).

For example, sample #2.4 "Remote Hangup" seem to assume that the REFER 
recipient will somehow automagically match existing dialog and send the 
request in the context of that dialog.

Has this type of usage been discussed and documented anywhere? If yes, 
then perhaps the document could point to some exact documentation, and 
perhaps explicitly clarify this kind of usage.

My personal opinion is, unless there is a specific mechanism in the 
REFER request to instruct REFER recipient to send outgoing request in a 
dialog context, we should ban such uses.

cheers,
-benny

event package were not a consideration for the sip-mib draft work.
certainly such a mib could be defined though.    if it were it
should be defined such that new event packages that are defined
could be represented in the mib w/out having to actually alter
the mib module itself (ie, don't define explicit objects for=20
each event pkg type).   avoid even enumerated values.  anything
that would require the mib module to be updated to support a new
event package.=20

I was going through this draft and it defines MIBS for SIP Method names
and SIP option tags.=20

I was wondering why there is no MIB for listing event packages defined
in various RFC's as per RFC 3265?

All the slides for todays SIP session are now up at:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/meeting_materials.cgi?meeting_num=3D6=
7

Please feel free to download these prior to the session.

If you are working remotely:

Session audio can be found at: http://videolab.uoregon.edu/events/ietf/
Jabber room instructions at:
http://www3.ietf.org/meetings/text_conf.html with room "sip"
After the session you will find the jabber logs here:

We are still short of a few for Friday's session. Authors if you are
presenting please get these to the SIP chairs ASAP. We have remote
participants. If we cannot get these in reasonable time we will force
everyone to work to the same conditions (i.e. if the audience are not
given the chance to get the slides, the presenter has to present without
the slides!).

(As SIP WG chair)

This document was recently on WGLC and has been updated to:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-certs-02.txt

In line with the comments made.

We took a quick poll in the WG today and there was a significant number
of people who had read the document, and all agreed that the document
was ready for submission to IESG.

We therefore declare this document done in the WG and will perform the
PROTO writeup.

Thankyou to Jason Fischl for his editing work on the document.

Regards

Keith

<font size="-1"><font color="#3333ff">Hello,<br>
<br>
Regardless of the general thread about the draft traction, I have a
technical question (suggestion) about a minor detail in this very
interesting document.<br>
<br>
The I-D defines in section 4.3 the behavior of a notifier, upon
reception of a "Supress-Notify-If-Match". According to the description,
there should be no difference in the "200 OK" message sent as an answer
to the "SUBSCRIBE" request, regardless of the "SIP-Etag" value being
equal or different to the "Supress-Notify-If-Match" value. That is: the
subscription refresh works exactly the same if the etag values are
equal or not, the only difference being whether the notifier will
afterwards send a "NOTIFY" or not. In particular, there is no explicit
need to carry a "SIP-Etag" header in the "200 OK" message issued by the
notifier.<br>
<br>
The problem I see with this is that the Watcher is not able to
determine whether the "etag" was the same, or simply a subsequent
"NOTIFY" message gets lost due to congestion problems.<br>
<br>
I would propose that the text in 4.3 explicitly states that the
"SIP-Etag" header be included in the "200 OK" answer to the "SUBSCRIBE"
request, in case that is feasible (I've checked RFC 3903 and I don't
see any issue with this). This way, a Watcher can determine, upon
receiving a "200 OK", if the entity tag is the same (and thus, no
additional "NOTIFY" is expected) or not (in this case, if a subsequent
NOTIFY is not received shortly, the client may suspect something wrong
is happenning, and act accordingly).<br>
<br>
I think this was implicit in section 4.3, as is the case of RFC 3903
for the "mirror" use case related to PUBLISH messages, but it may be
worth to still mention it explicitly (?). Perhaps the general rule is:
if you receive a "(...)If-Match" header in a request, you SHOULD/MUST
answer with a "SIP-Etag" header in its response, but I don't find any
explicit text about this...<br>
<br>
Sorry if I am missing anyething and/or my comment was already
implicitly tackled somewhere else...<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
David<br>
<br>
PS.- I agree that covering the RLS case in this doc would be extremely
desirable, as Etags and RLS are seen as two major Presence traffic
optimization mechanisms, and it would be very convenient to be able to
use them together.<br>

Subject: [Sip] Updated draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags

Hodwy,

Managed to squeeze in an update to the conditional subscribe draft:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-02.txt</a>

Major changes include:

- Bunch of clarifications and fixes contributed by Johnny Vrancken

- Added the concept of "*" entity-tag, as suggested by 
Christian Schmidt

The rationale for the latter change is that it turns out if 
you're suppressing NOTIFYs within the subscription, it doesn't 
matter what the actual value of the entity-tag is; the 
superfluous notifications should simply get suppressed by 
default. It is now possible by including

  Suppress-Notify-If-Match: *

to the SUBSCRIBE in subscription refreshes/unsubscribes. This 
has some other interesting uses as well, like being able to do 
a HEAD like query for the current entity-tag, or a 
heartbeat-type function to check the liveliness of a resource 
(without the extra cost of receiving the notification).

In essence, the client need not bother tracking the etags 
unless it is resuming a subscription, or using polling to 
query the state. To me, this is a simple addition that doesn't 
introduce any complexity, and ought to be the default behavior anyway.

I'm planning to make a fairly extensive rewrite of this draft 
to make it look more like an implementation spec, including 
adding detailed examples and moving some of the requirements 
text to an appendix.

However, before I commit to that, it would be nice to get some 
traction to the draft from the working group.

Is this something the SIP WG is interested in progressing as a 
WG effort?

Cheers,
Aki

Whether or not to display location or anything else from the headers is
completely up to the UA; it is a user interface decision.  

I don't think that there is any reason to include Content-Disposition at
all, or say anything about it in the document.

Scott,

The existence of the Content-Disposition header implies that it has some 
significance. Unfortunately 3261 is quite light on explanation of what 
that significance it. The header was originally defined for mail, and 
its clearer what the significance is there. For now we are groping along 
trying to figure this out for sip.

Consider a MESSAGE that contains a geoloc body. Should the recipient 
render that? Absent any indication otherwise, I suppose it probably should.

Then consider a MESSAGE that contains a multipart mixed containing two 
text/plain bodies. Should it display both of them? If not, which one?

What about a MESSAGE with a multipart with a geoloc body and a 
text/plain body? Display one or both?

Now suppose the MESSAGE has a multipart with geoloc and text/plain, and 
a GeoLocation header with cid referencing the geoloc body? Does the 
answer depend on whether the UAS understands the GeoLocation header?

There need to be some rules about how this works so that we get 
consistent results. Content-Disposition helps with this. In the above, 
the answers could all be resolved by rendering only those body parts 
that have a content-disposition of "render".

I think you're losing focus here.  The question is not to prescibe how
the receiving UA will process the message -- as Scott says, that's a
UA design issue.  The question is to ensure that the *intention* of
the *sending* UA is mutually understood.

An explicit or implied "Content-Disposition: render" implies that the
sender wants the contained location is to be shown to the recipient.
In practice, the receiving UA might not actually show it in the most
default mode of operation, but that will be its decision based on its
uderstanding of the recipient and the display situation.

Etc.

What becomes interesting is if the sending UA intends for the location
not to be information to be delivered to the recipient, but to be some
sort of metadata that is attached to the information to be delivered.
But the text of section 20.11 of RFC 3261 makes it clear that
Content-Disposition may be applied to body parts as well as to whole
bodies.

"Content-Disposition: attachment" is already defined, isn't it?

   From: Paul Kyzivat <pkyzivat@cisco.com>

   Consider a MESSAGE that contains a geoloc body. Should the recipient 
   render that? Absent any indication otherwise, I suppose it probably should.

Given that the default is "Content-Disposition: render" (except for
application/sdp), yes.

   Then consider a MESSAGE that contains a multipart mixed containing two 
   text/plain bodies. Should it display both of them? If not, which one?

Given that the default is "Content-Disposition: render", and the type
is "multipart/mixed" rather than "multipart/alternative", yes.

   What about a MESSAGE with a multipart with a geoloc body and a 
   text/plain body? Display one or both?

Given that the default is "Content-Disposition: render", and the type
is "multipart/mixed" rather than "multipart/alternative", yes.

   Now suppose the MESSAGE has a multipart with geoloc and text/plain, and 
   a GeoLocation header with cid referencing the geoloc body? Does the 
   answer depend on whether the UAS understands the GeoLocation header?

Would it be surprising if the processing of the message depends on
whether the recipient understands the GeoLocation header?

Given that the default is "Content-Disposition: render", and the type
is "multipart/mixed" rather than "multipart/alternative", yes.

All of the above follow directly from the pre-existing meanings of
Content-Disposition and Content-Type.  Or am I totally missing the
point?

Dale

(As SIP WG chair)

As part of the ICE discussion in MMUSIC, it has been identified that
there is a need for an option tag. RFC 3427 says that documents
specifying these need to be presented to IESG by SIP. Rather than
transfer the entirety of ICE back to SIP, the proposal is to create a
separate draft that specifies this option tag and pursue this in SIP.

I would appreciate if Jonathan would post to this list a some idea of
the semantics of the new option tag.

The intention of the SIP WG chairs is therefore to request the ADs to
approve a new milestone in this area.=20

Therefore does anyone in the SIP WG have an issue with the creation of a
new WG item that specifies such a new option-tag. This is intended to be
a fairly short term activity (as ICE is regarded as pretty much
finished) so please respond quickly.

Regards

Keith

Having talked directly to Shida.

I obviously need to expand this bit somewhat as it seems to have led to
more confusion that understanding.

The key idea is that at any one time only the RFC and one correction RFC
will exist - we do not directly update the original RFC as that would
lead us into a complete revision which would probably last as long as
the transition from RFC 2543 to RFC 3261.

The idea of allowing individual or related errors to be put into
separate drafts was to allow the less controversial ones to progress
independently of the more controversial ones which would require more
discussion. Thus I think it is still a good idea to do this although we
do have to be pragmatic and essentially make sure we split for the above
reason, rather than for the purpose of creating as many drafts as
possible.

One of the concerns of Shida was that all revisions would be identified
even before they become compiled into correction RFCs. I think we can
use the softarmor website to identify these, and also it would probably
help to include some special part of the draft naming to indicate this.

Having talked directly to Shida.

I obviously need to expand this bit somewhat as it seems to have led to
more confusion that understanding.

The key idea is that at any one time only the RFC and one correction RFC
will exist - we do not directly update the original RFC as that would
lead us into a complete revision which would probably last as long as
the transition from RFC 2543 to RFC 3261.

The idea of allowing individual or related errors to be put into
separate drafts was to allow the less controversial ones to progress
independently of the more controversial ones which would require more
discussion. Thus I think it is still a good idea to do this although we
do have to be pragmatic and essentially make sure we split for the above
reason, rather than for the purpose of creating as many drafts as
possible.

One of the concerns of Shida was that all revisions would be identified
even before they become compiled into correction RFCs. I think we can
use the softarmor website to identify these, and also it would probably
help to include some special part of the draft naming to indicate this.

The above mechanism provides an alternative to the GRID mechanism that
has recently been removed from the GRUU draft. It has previously been
agreed that solutions in this space are orthogonal to GRUU. The
mechanism provides capabilities in its own right, GRUU provides
capabilities in its own right, other capabilities can be obtained by
using the two extensions together.

During the meeting it was stressed that any documented solution had to
take into account backward compatibility (as if we don't already).

This message is to allow anyone on the mailing list who has issues with
the above decisions to post them. Otherwise we will approach the Area
Directors for the required charter update to include appropriate
milestones.

(As WG chair)

At the SIP WG meeting we agreed that

-	there was interest in the WG in developing a deliverable
addressing the issue of providing the UA with the original Request-URI
as well as the Contact used to reach that user;

-	that draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-00 provides the basis of
a mechanism for solving the above issue.

The above mechanism provides an alternative to the GRID mechanism that
has recently been removed from the GRUU draft. It has previously been
agreed that solutions in this space are orthogonal to GRUU. The
mechanism provides capabilities in its own right, GRUU provides

Dale,

I think you and I are in agreement about what all of this means.

Regarding "attachment": yes, it is currently defined for email. I think 
it might be suitable for reuse in this context, but that is certainly 
still subject to debate.

An alternative might be to define a special content-disposition for body 
parts that have their significance determined in some other way than via 
their mere presence in the body. Notably, when a body part is referenced 
  via a CID uri, the significance is determined by the reference, and 
typically shouldn't also be interpreted otherwise. A recipient that 
doesn't understand the header containing the CID should ignore the body 
part.

The semantics for the option tag are the same as for any other option 
tag - it means that ICE is supported.

ICE is normally signaled through SDP attributes, and there is no need 
for an option tag for the "normal" call flows. However, we ran into some 
issues with offerless INVITEs. In particular, it would be really, really 
helpful for a UA to construct an offer in a 18x or 2xx based on 
knowledge of whether the UA that sent the INVITE supports ICE. If they 
don't, there is no need to gather candidates in constructing an offer in 
the response.

Another use case that was suggested was to place the option tag in a 
REGISTER. This would inform the "network" about whether the UA supports 
ICE, and can be helpful in some of the backwards-compatibility 
techniques that people are looking at.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

I'm happy with this version.

In particular, I have quite satisfied with the parameter names 
"pub-gruu" and "temp-gruu" and don't think any further changes to the 
names would be helpful.

Hi All ,

    I am working on a SIP to Gr 303 Interworking project and was
wondering if there is draft /RFC that details the SIP call flows using
RFC 2833 Named Telephony Events for interworking with a GR 303 Gateway .

I think you mean, "in the Public..."

This text mixes what I think are two very different use cases. In
forwarding-related applications, its not that the identity of the party
changes (since it doesn't), but that the request eventually arrives at
an entity that is different than the one originally targeted by the
caller. That is quite distinct from the case where, due to a transfer on
the PSTN side, the identity of a party on the call changes.

I'd also note that the need for this in applications such as agent pools
and call park depends entirely on how those work; solutions which use
INVITE/Replaces or which purposefully obfuscate the identity of the
called party do not need this mechanism.

Is there a reason this is limited to INVITE-initiated dialogs? There are
use cases for SUBSCRIBE (though admittedly more corner cases).

I'd like to clarify here that this is referring to transfer where one
side is on the PSTN. Our standards-based techniques for transfer do not
suffer this problem.

I think its worth two sentences that explains why; I can just imagine
implementors asking why they need to send another reuqest when they can
just modify the To in the response.

This second sentence makes it sound like its the UAC thats inserting the
Identity header field. Suggest ending the sentence at "..of the request."

> The Identity header field is inserted by a suitable Authentication
> Service on the path of the mid-dialog request, typically at a proxy
> that record routes and is able to authenticate the UAC.

"typically" isn't strong enough; indeed there is a requirement that the
proxy providing the authtnication service has to record-route. Suggest
removing "typically".

>    additional request.  

Careful; this makes it sound like its JUST update. But its not; a 
re-INVITE can also be used.

This is very hard to parse. I think you mean that the UAS has to wait
until it receives a PRACK for a reliable provisional response it sent.
The text needs to be clearer that you actually have to implement RFC
3262 if you want to provide called party identity prior to answer.

These two sentences are somewhat contradictory. The first says that its 
been long enough that this is not a problem anymore for proxies. If so, 
why is it a problem for UAs which require an option tag?

I'm curious if we have evidence of any deployed UA at this point that 
would break by a change in URI.

I'm not objecting to the option tag; I just want to make sure we really 
have a need for it.

Your text in the overview requires the UA to wait for the PRACK.

2xx is final, not provisional.

I find the "MUST send UPDATE" questionable here. I reserve MUST for 
things which break if you don't do them. Clearly, nothing breaks here if 
you don't do this. So I don't think you can do more than SHOULD here.

the revised URI in the To header field

what about before the 2xx is received? For example a pipelined request?

I think the rule here is actually much simpler - you include, in the 
 From header field, your "current identity", whatever that is, and NOT 
the local URI from the dialog state as described in RFC 3261.

The rules in this section omit any guidance on the To header field. I 
think you have to say that you include the current remote identity of 
the peer, where that current identity is now being updated based on the 
rules in section 4.4.2, rather than being fixed at the beginning of the 
dialog as in RFC 3261.

> Note that this involves terminating the dialog.  To avoid this, it
>       is recommended in section Section 4.6 that a Verifier should avoid

double section

Well yes, except that this section is about receiving requests, not 
sending them.

What you should say is that the remote URI, defined in RFC 3261 as part 
of the dialog state, MUST be updated with the value of the From header 
field in the request. Thats it. That update can be done regardless of 
whether it differs from the previous one; its just a no-op if they are 
the same. This allows you to simplify the rule here.

> A proxy that record routes during an INVITE request MUST be tolerant

This is a bit hard to follow.

Suggest:

A proxy that receives a mid-dialog request MUST be prepared for either 
to the To or From header field URI to differ from those that appeared in 
the dialog forming request or response.

> A proxy that is able to provide an Authentication Service or a
>    Verifier for mid-dialog requests MUST record route if Supported:
>    from-change is indicated in the dialog forming request.

I think this rule is really just for authentication services. If the 
verifier is in the UA clearly it doesn't need to record-route.

missing open bracket.


In the examples section:

* message 2 should have the Max-Forwards decremented by 1 (to 69)
* same with message 6, 8
* all messages with Identity - please use the <alloneline> technique 
from Roberts torture test draft so that you can line fold for readability.

I don't want to encourage b2bua and this form of transfer, so I'd prefer 
that this section be recast as using a pstn gateway.

> A.2.  Existing methods for providing authenticated identity information

This appendix doesn't really add much value. I'd suggest removing it.

If anything, the main question folks will have is why not just use 
P-A-ID in the 18x or 2xx. As you may know despite RFC 3325 rules that 
say this is not allowed, IMS has gone ahead and specified that anyway 
for connected identity.

For those not at the meeting, one of the comments at the mike was that 
"temp-gruu" is a bad name since "temporary" is not really the opposite 
of "public". A related comment was that these GRUU might not be very 
temporary at all if a UA remains registered for days or weeks.

My thoughts on this is that there is nothing that says these GRUU are 
opposites. They share some properties, and differ in others. So I don't 
think we need to use something that is the opposite of "public" 
("private" and "anonymous" had been suggested). Indeed, the reason we 
didn't use "private" or "anonymous" was that we didn't want to give any 
false sense of privacy. Usage of the GRUU itself does NOT provide a 
complete privacy solution. "Privacy" and "anonymity" are complex topics.

Finally, though a temporary GRUU may last a long time, its still 
temporary relative to the public GRUU, which has a nearly infinite lifetime.


Thanks,

-Jonathan R.

The problem isn't primarily that they're not opposites, but rather
that they're orthogonal properties and therefore don't divide
the space. Why can't you have a temporary public gruu?

To me, "public" was trying to summarize two key properties:

1. relative long lived-ness
2. correlatable to the AOR

with that notion of "public", a temporary public gruu isn't sensible.

All

RFC 3261, section 20.43 (about the Warning header) has this sentence:

"The first digit of warning codes beginning with "3" indicates warnings 
specific to SIP. "

... then goes on to subdivide the 300-399 ranges into smaller categories.

This quoted sentence does not have normative text in it, and a proposal in 
a side group of IETFers has suggested this sentence in 3261 doesn't 
actually limit Warning codes to 3XX, but that other 3 digit sequences 
outside the 300-399 range can be proposed.

Is this allowable?

And if so, does anyone have great heartburn about using another well 
defined range (also) for the Warning header within SIP?

If this is agreeable, the new Warning codes would have to be IANA registered.

Thanks
James

Sure, but I don't think that's the connotation it actually has...

While there is another way of doing transfer, and I certainly don't 
advocate including a B2BUA in a call for the sole purpose of doing 
transfers, there *are* reasonable uses for this kind of topology. For 
instance it is quite appropriate for "click to dial" scenarios. So I do 
think it is appropriate to acknowledge the case.

(Its not the B2BUA that is bad, it is the improper use of a B2BUA that 
is bad. Somehow that sounds familiar. :-)

Hi James,

If you look at Section 14.46 of RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1) you will see where 
SIP borrowed the Warning header field from and the list of defined 
codes.  They are defined in the 1xx and 2xx ranges for HTTP.  The intent 
was not to step on these ranges with SIP warning codes.  If we are 
running out of codes in the 3xx range, I don't see why we couldn't use a 
4xx range.

Thanks,
Alan

Alan

Thanks for the comment

One proposal is to go for a range not used by SIP or HTTP for any purposes: 
the 7XX range.

Is this ok?

Or should the Conveyance doc just bump up to the next range (the 4XX)?

There's nothing magic about the numbers, so the only advantage to 4xx is 
that it's next in (hundreds) line with 3xx and thus leaves a larger area 
undisturbed.

Hi Guys,

This is regarding protocol conformance test tool scope.

Does the scope of protocol conformance test tool
1.	Test only one protocol stack?
2.	Test More than one protocol stack where stacks are placed on different
PCs.

Is there any tool which addresses second option if it is in the scope?

Thanks !
Rathod.

[JRE] Of course this doesn't help if the offerless INVITE request came from
a B2BUA that does not handle SDP/media. The B2BUA might not know whether the
UA to which the SDP offer will be sent supports ICE or not. So the absence
of Supported: ice would not necessarily be safe grounds for skipping ICE
stuff.

hi,

after review of draft-ietf-sip-outbound-05 I have the following
questions related to the used transport protocol

It appears that Outbound-05 does not allow to switch the transport
protocol over which SIP is used. Outbound-05 says that a User Agent
terminating SIP request has to be sent to the User Agent over the flow
on which the REGISTER was received. The definition of flow in
Outbound-05 includes also the transport protocol. Now there seems to be
a problem when the REGISTER was sent over UDP and, at some point later,
a SIP INVITE request is too long to be sent over UDP, so that it needs
to be sent over TCP (see RFC 3261 section 18.1.1). This seems not
possible with Outbound-05. The switchover from UDP to TCP is a strong
requirement and in case this is not supported the usability of the draft
seems to be rather restricted.=20


Peter

A UA that is expecting to engage in this behavior would need to  
establish TCP and UDP bindings via outbound registration.

I suppose one could extend the system to add a management message  
that would tell a UA that had registered using UDP to build up a new  
registration using TCP, but we don't have anything quite like this  
now. There have been some suggestions from the systems management  
people that there would be interest in using SIP to tell a UA to  
establish a "management connection" on demand, and what you're  
suggesting is fairly similar.

Or we could just deprecate UDP. Folks know where I stand on that  
one . . .

Hi Peter,

The primary motivator for outbound is traversal of NATs and firewalls.  
There is no technical way that an inbound TCP connection through these 
NATs would work. However, outbound allows multiple flows to be 
established.  A UA could establish both a UDP flow and a TCP flow to 
allow for switchover.

I will point out that the initially the outbound spec only addressed 
stream-oriented flows.

thanks,
-rohan

To me it sounds like we have to, at least for UACs using Outbound. Let's 
do it! ;)

You could make the same case for any options tag. For instance, some
B2BUA's strip out the 100rel tag from the supported header because they
want to muck with the early media being generated, and don't want the
hassle of having to deal with PRACK on one side of the call, and not on
the other side.

Just because there's something in the middle that may strip the options
tag doesn't mean that it is of no utility. There's really no reason for
a B2BUA to strip out the ice option tag given all the backoff logic
built into the draft when the other side appears to not support ICE. If
the B2BUA really didn't want ICE to run, it would also be messing with
the SDP crossing through it too. So where's the harm?

Regards,
Brian

I think the idea of having an option tag in the REGISTER is a good idea.
It may be helpful when the network is trying to initiate a call to the
client.

In that case, how about a callee capability instead / in addition (RFC3840)?
i.e. a UA would form its Contact as:

Contact: <sip:whatever>;+sip.ice

The outbound draft needs to say: "if a UA establishes a flow using an 
unreliable transport, it MUST also establish one over a reliable transport" 
(to support switch over). Moreover, I would suggest to add "it is 
RECOMMENDED that the UA establishes a flow using a reliable transport"

Brian,

You miss my point. I am not talking about a B2BUA stripping an option tag
from a received INVITE request before forwarding the request. I am talking
about a B2BUA originating an INVITE request (during a 3PCC make call
situation). In this case the B2BUA has no grounds on which to include the
option tag.

John

John,

Ah, I wasn't thinking about 3PCC in my comment.=20

If there's a tag in the registered contact for the UA that the offerless
INVITE is for though, then the INVITE going out could have the option
tag in it (as the B2BUA would know something about the UA it's
initiating 3PCC for).

If we allowed the Supported header to be in responses, then you could
even let the option-tag flow across the B2BUA as part of the 3PCC setup.
As an aside, why on earth do we not allow the Supported header in a
response other than 2xx (looking at 3261)?

Regards,
Brian

IMO we won't find any terms with names that are acceptably short and 
memorable and have precisely the correct connotation for everybody.

While the names clearly are intended to have some meaningful 
connotation, when you get down to the details it is the formal 
definition in the spec that matters. I don't think the current names are 
going to cause anybody to make some huge mistake, so I think they are 
good enough.

If there is a decision to change them, then I think we will either spend 
a bunch of time just arguing about what name to use, or else we will 
pick other names that have other problems, or both.

	Paul

Yes, I agree - I specifically asked for this in the WG meeting.  I think it
will help for mixed ICE/non-ICE networks.

Personally, I like r-gruu and l-gruu, based on which hemisphere of  
the brain might choose to use them.

Or maybe statgruu and dyngruu, referring not to  their functions, but  
to a couple of engineering classes (statics and dynamics) that pained  
me almost as much as this conversation.

Can it, in case of an edge proxy being used? An incoming request that 
has passed the authoritative proxy is already destined for a _specific_ 
flow between the UA and the edge proxy.

This means the authoritative proxy needs information about the transport 
used for each flow, and use this knowledge when it decides which edge 
proxy and which flow it should send an incoming request towards. Seems 
impractical to say the least.

Peter - this is a good point.

I don't think outbound changes SIP in any way on this. If your UA  
supports TCP and UDP and your proxy had deployed both, then using TCP  
or both is a *real good idea*. This is as true in 3261 as it is with  
outbound. If your UA does not support TCP or your proxy does not  
allow TCP to be used for whatever reasons - then switching does not  
work. Again outbound is same as 3261 here.

The gist of this is that deprecating UDP is a very separable problem  
from outbound and that I think outbound is the wrong place to go have  
this debate.

I have no problem pointing out that when doing outbound, if you don't  
register withy TCP, the proxy can't switch from UDP to TCP.

For better or worse, I do expect to see lots of UDP only usage of  
outbound in the next few years.

Hi Fredrik,

I was thinking that the UDP flow would fail and the proxy would try the 
next flow (which happens to be CP), but I realized that we have no 
response to convey this semantic.  The 430 Flow Failed response code 
won't work here because the flow hasn't failed, it just can't be used 
for this transaction.

thanks,
-rohan

[JRE] I don't think this is a reasonable assumption. The B2BUA is initiating
a call from A to B, where A is in its domain, say, but B could be anywhere.
It sends an offerless INVITE to A. It is unlikely to know the capabilities
of B.
Yes, I appreciate that it can also happen the opposite way round, in which
case the option tag could work. The point is, there are so many
circumstances in which an offerless INVITE can be used that I don't think it
is reasonable to assume that the absence of Supported: ice means that ICE is
definitely not supported.

   As an aside, why on earth do we not allow the Supported header in a
   response other than 2xx (looking at 3261)?

I would assume it's because non-2xx responses are always terminal..
Though the omission of 1xx responses seems to be a mistake.

I think it's enough to have a recommendation. In some cases it may not
be possible/feasible to establish a TCP connection - no matter if you
use outbound or not.

I think it's enough to have a recommendation. In some cases it may not
be possible/feasible to establish a TCP connection - no matter if you
use outbound or not.

I don't agree with the "or both" part of your recommendation above.

As I see it, if your UA and your proxy both support TCP (or TLS) you 
SHOULD NOT use UDP since that would increase the probability of 
something failing. Such failures will be fairly hard to diagnose too, 
and will lead to UAs being written in a way where they retry say a 
re-INVITE until it succeeds or the user aborts.

Also, I don't think that outbound is 100% the same as 3261 in this 
aspect. Outbound actually prevents (edge) proxies from picking a 
transport themselves, since requests they receive can/will be targeted 
at a _specific flow_.

I guess some people don't want to have that debate anywhere at all.

Is there someone that wouldn't agree that it is easier for a client to 
get the desired properties of outbound with TLS/TCP than with UDP? The 
desired properties here is to get through NATs.

If there are no one that objects to this, then why would it be so hard 
to say that a UA that wants these properties MUST (or at least SHOULD) 
NOT use UDP? This is not the same as deprecating SIP over UDP.

/Fredrik

I don't even think we should have a SHOULD in this case. As Cullen said,
I think the it's-better-to-use-TCP-than-UDP is a core SIP issue, and not
only related to outbound.

But, yes, we can explain the issue.

The edge proxy can return a error code (whatever the value will be), and
the one actually choosing the flow can choose another flow.

Then we need to think whether the one choosing the flow knows which flow
will be TCP, or if the information needs to be provided in some
header/header parameter.

You can have NATs even if you don't use outbound.

This will be neither simple nor fast, and therefor not good. So let's 
not go that way.

So what was your point exactly? Did you object to my statement that UAs 
that wants to get through NATs would be better off using TLS/TCP?

Outbound is not an alternative to rport. Outbound provides you with
keep-alives, and multiple flows (in case one fails), which rport
doesn't. rport simply tells you where to send some stuff.

It can also become interesting with certain security mechanisms, can't
it?

I remember, from the good old days of the SIP-versus-H.323
"discussions", PowerPoint slides showing how great SIP is because you
can use it with both UDP and TCP.... ;)

Christer

Hello,

	CANCEL request is sent when response to INVITE message is not received. If
this INVITE request is lost and UA may still send a CANCEL request. Is this
possible? Can CANCEL request be sent without sending an INVITE message?

	What is the basic difference between INFO and OPTIONS method? can OPTIONS

	Why is ACK request required? Is it just to avoid retransmission of response

Please reply.

Thank you.

Please enumerate the cases.

Unless there are concrete cases where TCP simply does not work, I would
strongly recommend we drop UDP from outbound altogether. Remember, UDP
already kind of works in presence of NAT; this is why we have for
instance rport.

Dropping UDP as a choice in outbound will make the decision to drop it
from SIP a lot easier in the long run. Then again, keeping it in
outbound will all but guarantee it will be absolutely tedious ripping it
out later on.

Oh, and if we did drop UDP, then the choice of the keepalive mechanism
becomes, well, interesting. ;)

Cheers,
Aki

I never said it was a replacement. However, the world is full of
deployments that use UDP and work through NAT just fine (kind of); some
use rport, some use something else. Clearly, these folks aren't holding
out their deployments waiting for outbound to finish.

Many (including me) here have said TCP/TLS offers UAs superior ability
to traverse NAT compared to UDP. Yet, we insist on keeping UDP around
claiming it's needed because TCP doesn't sometimes work in outbound.

But unless someone can clearly explain where and how TCP fails to work
in a show-stopper manner, such claims are hogwash, and we should just
bite the bullet and make sip-outbound TCP-only.

Right. And now RealLife is showing that sometimes when it comes to
transports (among other things), having too many options is a Bad
Thing. ;-)

I don't think they have to. They can add outbound in future releases,
together with whatever other new fancy SIP extensions...

Jonathan,

Thanks for your comments. I have attempted to handle most of them in the
post-meeting update of the draft, to appear shortly, but in a few cases I
have had to err on the cautious side because it has been through WGLC. The
comments missing from below are accepted:

>

[JRE] Yes, I saw these more as corner cases, although it wouldn't do any
harm to permit its use with SUBSCRIBE-initiated dialogs. As this has been
through WGLC I would like some other opinions on whether to add this
possibility.

[JRE] I propose to add just the following: "Note that even if identity were
to be conveyed somehow in a response, there would in general be difficulty
authenticating the UAS except in cases where the UA is connected to its
proxy by TLS and has already been authenticated. Providing identity in a
separate request allows normal authentication techniques." Is this
sufficient?

[JRE]The point is, it doesn't have to be at a proxy - the UAC itself could
provide this service, particularly if it is a gateway. How about "Unless
provided at the UAC, the Authentication Service must be at a proxy that
record routes and is able to authenticate the UAC"?

[JRE] This has been in here for some time. I think there was a feeling that
the population of dialog stateful proxies will be much smaller than the
population of UAs, and also that proxies would perhaps be more likely to be
kept up to date. Perhaps that is a wild assumption, but at the time people
seemed to want to be more cautious where UAs were concerned. Also the option
tag has the useful additional property that it advises a proxy to record
route (if not doing so anyway) so that it can deploy an Authentication
Service on mid-dialog requests.

[JRE] An older version did indeed have "SHOULD", but was changed. This is
possibly the most essential requirement in the whole spec. What is the point
of claiming support for this spec if you don't send an UPDATE request at
least in this situation?

[JRE] I tend to agree. There could be a verifier at a proxy, and that proxy
is free to record route if it wishes, but I guess we don't need to prescribe
that here. So agreed.

[JRE] This is just an example of what occurs in practice, this being one of
the use cases that connected-identity can solve. I will make it clear that
the B2BUA is performing 3PCC techniques according to RFC 3725 and cite
click-to-dial as an example application.

[JRE] I have no objection - it is largely historic, which is why it was
relegated to an appendix. If anyone objects to its removal, please shout.

[JRE] True, although it shouldn't be used unless there is a means of
authenticating the responder (e.g., based on TLS), so it has limitations in
theory, even if these limitations are ignored in practice. In fact I think
RFC 3325 should be updated to clarify this (i.e. allow PAI in a response in
appropriate circumstances). Likewise PAI can be used in a mid-dialog request
to indicate a change of identity. But PAI is asserted identity and relies on
transitive trust, whereas the objective of connected-identity is to provide
an authenticated identity based on RFC 4474. I will add some text at the end
of the Introducation section to say why response identity is inappropriate.

provided that outbound provides any value add to what we currently
already have implemented and is deployable, i.e., there is a
standardized dhcp-free discovery mechanism (like the one that jonathan
proposed).  

on another topic, i read jonathan's ice slides and while it provides a
little bit more than what we currently have (no need for relay in some
scenarios), its complexity was overwhelming and would thus not warrant
implementing.

Hi Folks,

I'd really like to finish outbound.  Up until a few days ago, I had 
incorporated all the comments I'd received except for some style 
comments I was reviewing from Keith.

The problem I see is that we have two separate communities using the 
outbound draft:

1) folks that want to get through NATs and Firewalls in the public 
Internet at large - they want to use TCP and TLS with double CRLF for 
keepalives. One "flow" is always one connection.  The milestone for 
this would read "Make TCP and TLS work in the Internet".

2) folks that want UDP to work through specific NATs even if the edge 
proxy, NAT, or interface hiccups - some of these folks want to treat 
multiple IPsec SAs so the definition of "flow" becomes terribly fuzzy 
to everyone else, and they need to use STUN keepalives.

<soapbox>
I would like to use this opportunity to point out that if we said "out 
of scope for now" to outbound over UDP then we would already be done 
now and there would already be multiple implementations, including one 
that I started for the repro open source proxy.  We would have 
sidestepped the fuzzy "flow" terminology and all the endless debates 
about STUN keepalive usage and discovery, since double CRLF is fully 
backwards compatible with even RFC 2543 implementations.  I am bringing 
this up on the list because I hope the WG can look back on this and not 
make the mistake of snowballing complexity to preserve UDP parity again 
in the future.
</soapbox>

At this point, I believe that these decisions are water under the 
bridge.  I would like to explore ways forward:

FASTEST (hold nose and swallow):
Normatively RECOMMEND using congestion-safe transports for outbound.  
Point out that if you only use UDP flows you can't switch over to TCP, 
and that using a UDP flow when you have a perfectly good TCP flow is 
complete silliness.  I'll point out that TCP has been mandatory to 
implement in both UAs and proxies for 4 years.

CLEANEST (the 2 more years! approach):
Split outbound up so that we have at least three drafts:
a) an update to Path that uses a reg-id to store multiple 
bindings/paths back to a UA regardless of transport.  this is useful in 
the multiple radio interface use case for example even if there are no 
NATs.
b) a STUN keep-alive draft - with or without discovery.  I'm not 
writing it--I think it is a terrible idea.
c) outbound *connections* draft for TCP and TLS over TCP only.  (If you 
want outbound for SCTP you can write your own damn draft).
d) possibly a SIP over UDP NAT traversal draft.  Again, I have no 
interest in working on a draft with this kind of draft.

If you think you have a clever/better proposal than one of these, 
please send me private mail or phone me.

Please send comments to the list or directly to me.  If you support one 
of these two approaches, please put FASTEST or CLEANEST in the first 
line of the message.

thanks,
-rohan

I am not at all sure that we agreed on anything with respect to this.

True. But it would be nice to be able to optimize the 'opposite way

I am not at all sure that we agreed on anything with respect to this.

True. But it would be nice to be able to optimize the 'opposite way
around' though.

Hi Folks,

I've incorporated all the changes we agreed to at IETF67.  For those who
have not seen them yet, please consult the slides available here:
http://www3.ietf.org/proceedings/06nov/slides/sip-3.pdf

In addition, I have proposed text for Issues D&E (see below).

In summary, we agreed from the meeting:
- Consensus to use 430 response
- Consensus to keep the "stable flow timer"
Bug A: No objection to fixing this bug
Issue B: consensus to only require 1st hop and registrar to participate
Issue C: consensus for No Action
Issue D: did not discuss, proposal mentioned below
Issue E: did not discuss, proposal mentioned below
Issue F: consensus for No Action
Issue 3G: rough consensus to Accept action 2

(Bug A): Provided mention of the 'rport' parameter.

(Issue 3G): Relaxed flow-token language slightly. Instead of flow-token
saving specific UDP address/port tuples over which the request arrived,
make language fuzzy to save token which points to a =91logical flow=92 th=
at is
known to deliver data to that specific UA instance.

(Issue B): Changed registrar verification so that only first-hop proxy an=
d
the registrar need to support outbound.  Other intermediaries in between
do not any more.

(Issues D&E): Proposal text:
The UAC can situationally decide whether to request outbound behavior by
including or omitting the 'reg-id' parameter.  For example, imagine the
outbound-proxy-set contains two proxies in different domains, EP1 and EP2.
 If an outbound-style registration succeeded for a flow through EP1, the
UA might decide to include 'outbound' in its option-tag when registering
with EP2, in order to insure consistency.  Similarly, if the registration
through EP1 did not support outbound, the UA might decide to omit the
'reg-id' parameter when registering with EP2.

I believe the proposed text for D&E is sufficient and should be fairly
non-controversial.  If anyone has any objections, please speak up ASAP
(and *send text* ;-).

thanks,
-rohan

Rohan,

Minor issue for outbound-05: section 3.1 (and the references) refers to STUN 
as "Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs". It's now "Simple Traversal 
Underneath Network Address Translators" (in 
draft-ietf-behave-rfc3489bis-05.txt)

Not that "underneath" makes much sense here (to me), but I guess they wanted 
backwards compatibility for the acronym while including other transports

Regards,
Jeroen

FASTEST

I think it really WILL be two more years if we go for "cleanest", and I 
don't even see it as a loss to solve the problem for only those 
transports where it is solved easily.

What is the _real_ reason that user agents only implement UDP, anyway?

Most of them have TCP stacks already (for web browsing in mobile phones, 
and web interfaces in other), and even though it is harder to do 
message de-framing yourself, it isn't _that_ hard.
In my implementation I do TCP message de-framing in less than 130 lines 
of code.

/Fredrik

Hi Brian,
Hi James,

I have reviewed the document.

First, I would like to thank you for improving the document. But, I 
still have a few comments:

Questions:


You write:
"

    A dereference of a location-by-reference URI using SUBSCRIBE is not
    violating a PIDF-LO 'retransmission-allowed' element value set to
    'no', as the NOTIFY is the only message in this multi-message series
    of transactions that contains the UAC's location, with the location
    recipient being the only SIP element to receive location - which the
    purpose of this extension: to convey location to a specific
    destination.
"

I wasn't quite sure what you are about to say with this statement. If the

Location Recipient receives a reference and it resolves it then you are

saying that this is OK even if the retransmission-allowed flag says "no".

Correct?


Technical Aspects:

* Proxy Usage

When a proxy adds a reference to a PIDF-LO then a number of issues remain

unclear (as discussed throughout the Geopriv work), namely:

   - What does the PIDF-LO contain that is created by the SIP proxy?


* How does the proxy know that location information has to be added?

   - There is a privacy problem if the SIP proxy acts without explicit

indication that location information is added.


* Using Protocol

You write:
"
    Other protocols used in the Location URI MUST be reviewed against
    the RFC3693 criteria for a using protocol.
"

Later, in Section 3.6 you write:
"
Use of other protocols for dereferencing
    of a pres: URI is not defined, and such use is subject to review
    against RFC3693 using protocol criteria.
"

I disagree that the protocol used to resolve the reference has to be a 
using

protocol. Hence, I suggest to delete this sentence.


* Privacy Rules

You write:
"
    Entities receiving location information MUST honor the usage element
    rules per RFC4119.  Such entities MUST NOT alter the rule set.
"

The last sentence is not correct. Let me give you an example: A SIP UAC

obtains location information from GPS and uses a PUBLISH to upload the

PIDF-LO to the Location Server/ Presense Server. This server has rules that

control access to location information. As part of these rules the content

of the Location Object including the rules might be modified.


* The examples pick unfortunate references 
(sips:server5.atlanta.example.com/alice123)
that give me the impression that the reference contains the user identity.
The document clearly needs to point out that this is not the case. The 
document also does not indicate

that the reference is only kept for a certain period of time (soft-state).
The document does not even mention security aspects when retrieving the

reference.


* Security in Section 5 SIP Element Behavior

I am confused with the text in Section 5. What MUST and what SHOULD be used

when protecting a location-by-value and a location-by-reference?

SHOULD for TLS usage with location-by-value and location-by-reference.
No statement about usage of S/MIME.

I wonder why self-signed certificates shouldn't be used as stated with:
"
    Self-signed certificates SHOULD NOT be used for protecting PIDF,
    as the sender does not have a secure identity of the recipient.
"
For encryption (and that's what we are talking about here) it heavily

depends on the way how the self-signed certificate was obtained. I might

share my certificate with you and hence that's an extemely useful way todo

compared to the usage of TLS in a hop-by-hop way where a number of entities

see my location along the path.

Identity info in the PIDF. In previous discussion I was wondering and 
asking

the Geopriv group whether there is some semantic associated with the

identity in the PIDF. If there is, then you cannot put anything you like

into the PIDF. If there isn't then why should we ever want to put something

meaningful in there since it greatly impacts the privacy risks.

I see a problem with retargeting and forking where the Location 
Recipient is actually not know ahead of time and S/MIME usage is 
actually not really feasible. Would some guidance be useful?

* Section 7.

The document refers to 'using protocols' for both the UAC <-> UAS and to 
the dereferencing protocol. I assume that Section 7 only addresses the 
UAC <-> UAS communication. Since I am in favor of not treating the 
derefencing protocol a 'using protocol' I am fine with it.

Actually, I would prefer to move Section 7 into the appendix since this 
is just such an artifical story that it makes me nervous. It is not your 
fault; it is just the way how RFC 3693 was written.

* The security consideration section isn't particularly good. If I have 
time I rewrite it.



Editorial Aspects:

The term 'Location' is written with a capital letter (see for example first

paragraph in Section 1) whereas other RFC3693 terms that are meant to be

written with a capital letter aren't (example: 'target', 'location object',

'using protocol', 'location recipient'). I suggest to stick with RFC3693.


"
    This document describes how Location can be "conveyed" (that is,
    sent on the Internet) from a SIP user agent, or in some
    circumstances a proxy server acting on behalf of a user agent, to
    another entity using the SIP [RFC3261] protocol.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"

Either write using SIP [..] or using the Session Initiation Protocol [...].


I suggest to rewrite the following paragraph from:

"
    As recited in RFC3693, location often must be kept private.  The
    location object (PIDF-LO) contains rules which are binding on the
    location recipient and controls onward distribution and retention of
    the location.  This document describes the security and privacy
    considerations that must be applied to location conveyed with SIP.

"

to:

"
    The
    Location Object contains rules which provide guidance for the Location

Recipient on the onward distribution and retention of
    the received location information.  This document describes the 
security

and privacy
    considerations that must be applied to location conveyed with SIP.
"


I don't know what this sentence should mean in Section 1 at this part of 
the

section.
"
Often, location is sent from the User Agent Client to the User Agent
    Server, or vice versa for purposes that are beyond the scope of this
    document.
"

There seems to be a copy-and-paste problem.


You write:

"
    The Geolocation header is introduced to signify that location is
    included in a SIP message to provide either a content identifier
    (cid:) pointer to the body part containing the UAs PIDF-LO, or a
    location-by-reference URI that may subsequently be "dereferenced" by
    a using protocol (which may be SIP or another protocol).
"

Please delete the following part " by
    a using protocol (which may be SIP or another protocol)" since we 
haven't

concluded in our discussion that the dereferencing protocol is indeed a

using protocol.

Actually, I think that the entire paragraph is not particularly useful in

the introduction and the subsequent paragraph fits much better to the

previous one.


You write:
"
The Geolocation header MUST contain one two types of URIs:
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                     one of two types
"


The example contains a company name

(<gp:provided-by>www.cisco.com</gp:provided-by>) although it should,

according to the guidelines something like "www.example.com".


Section 4.3 uses the term 'LIS' and does not mention what it is.
Just avoid it.


IDNITS:

   Experimental warnings:
   - Missing Reference: 'RFC3851' is mentioned on line 343, but not defined
     'resulting resolution, per [RFC3851], resolves to a sip: or sips:...'

   - Unused Reference: 'ID-Loc-Reg' is defined on line 891, but not

referenced
     '[ID-Loc-Reg]...'


   Checking nits according to http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt:

     feeds but 26 pages

Yes, correct.  In fact if 3 proxies on the path sequentially resolve the
reference when retransmission-allowed='no' that is okay.  However, none of
those proxies may retransmit the location.

First of all, you are making an assumption that the proxy creates the value
returned by the reference it adds.  That is not likely the case.  It's more
likely that the proxy has access to a LIS which supplies it the reference to
include.

I think the reference resolves to the same PIDF-LO that the LIS would have
given the endpoint.  If indeed the proxy actually is the dereference agent,
then it would return a PIDF-LO that would look exactly like a LIS would
provide.  I'm expecting such a PIDF-LO would have very few of the fields
defined in PIDF.  For example, a "Contact" is unlikely to be present.  Most
importantly, I think the proxy, like the LIS, has to include a ruleset that
conforms to the preferences of the target.

I'm not sure that there needs to be any text in conveyance that says that.

The use case we know about is the emergency case, where location is not
provided by the endpoint and the proxy knows where the endpoint is.  The
only circumstance that is likely to be true is where the SIP network and the
access network are the same domain, or they have pre-established
relationship, and a way of correlating identifiers such that the SIP network
can get the correct location (or reference).

Here, perhaps we need text that explains this.  I had expected this would
appear in ecrit-framework, but I'm not sure now that it's a good idea to
limit proxy add of location to the emergency case.

I do think we get into pretty serious sticky wickets with what we can say
for the non-emergency case.  I would expect we have to say that the proxy
has explicit permission, and a ruleset by the target for the location it is
adding, but that doesn't really express the wishes of the target of WHEN it
is okay to add location.

Well, perhaps this should be discussed in the LbyR design team.  Certainly,
the location value is carried in the protocol.  I don't understand how it
could not be viewed as a using protocol.

While I can imagine a way to express a rule that modifies the ruleset, I
don't think we have ever discussed that kind of rule.  If we allow such
things that we need some pretty convoluted language.  If you want such a
capability, then please propose wording that permits a rule to modify a rule
set, but doesn't allow an arbitrary modification of the ruleset and show me
some other place where we have used that language.  This has to be the same
as, for example, presence.

The notion of a time limited reference is specific to the scheme.  It was
proposed in Henning (et al)'s SIP based LCP for example, but not in all LbyR
mechanisms.  I don't know if -conveyance is the right place to discuss that
issue.

We don't have any mechanism that discusses how long any element should keep
a reference, regardless of whether the dereference mechanism has an
expiration.  Another LbyR design team topic?

I'd prefer that -conveyance not be the place that defines such things.

Yeah, we should clean up the language here.  I think both.

Right.  Need some text that S/MIME SHOULD be used to protect a value or
reference if the intention is that the only element that should get it is
the opposite UA.

Perhaps you would send some text to cover this case.  I tried a couple of
ways and didn't think my attempts made any sense.

I don't understand this.  If it's LbyV and the endpoint puts it in, then it
controls the identity, and it CAN put anything it wants to.

In a case of LbyR, then the LIS, or whomever is constructing the PIDF needs
a mechanism to allow the target to specify a ruleset, and probably needs to
allow it to specify the identity as well.

Not sure I know what you mean.  I've long considered the problem that the
hop by hop mechanism allows any proxy on the path to see location, but it
also allows the opposite UA to see it.  There isn't a way to say "I trust
the proxies, but I don't trust the endpoint".  On the other hand,
retarget/fork may be precisely the reason S/MIME can't be used, and TLS is
very appropriate.

I do think at least mentioning the issue here is warranted.  I don't see
need for more mechanism.

See above; I fail to see how the dereference can possibly avoid being a
using protocol.

I don't understand your objection to the text as written.  Are you objecting
to the reference to 3693, the explicit mention of PIDF-LO, the word
"binding" or something else?

Hmmm.  We really do have to agree on terminology, no question.  The notion
that LIS is not acceptable is very disconcerting.  Outside of IETF, LIS is a
well understood term.  Location Generator is not.

Hi Rohan,

I do not have any objections to any of the proposals you made
for Outbound. However I have a question related to the Issue 3G
you had on your slideset. The slideset outlined the 3GPP requirement
as follows:

- 3GPP and others want to store multiple path vectors back to an
instance, each associated with a reg-id.
- New registrations with the same reg-id would replace the old binding.
* BUT 3GPP wants to do this unrelated to outbound flow-token
processing
* 3GPP wants separation of binding behavior and flow-token
behavior=20
* Why? Their IPsec UDP uses several pairs of actual flows,
instead of just one.

In 3GPP there is also a backwards compatibility issue related
to the IPSec SA management in the edge proxy (P-CSCF). Old
implementations not supporting Outbound would drop the old=20
logical flow (IPSec SA) if the UA registers with a new reg-id
and IP address. Thus the UA should be able to make sure that=20
the edge proxy supports the new behaviour, before trying to
establish multiple flows over different access networks
towards the single edge proxy.

They have been proposing a new option tag for this purpose,
something like this:

   Name: mreg
   Description: This option-tag is used to identify SIP servers which
      are able to maintain multiple logical flows per UA instance.

What do you think about this proposal ?=20

Regards,

Erkki

Some industries and organizations have invested in PKI, and thus have
certificates available for authentication. We would like to leverage
those credentials for SIP authentication. Using certificates instead of
UICCs or other credentials is attractive for certain deployment models.
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-01
.txt describes some requirements related to this issue, as well as a
review of previous and related work. We have received good feedback
offline from authors of related work which were incorporated into the
latest draft.

Hi Varsha,
   The Call Flow in section 3.3.1 of the draft is a standard call
between two PSTN subscribers wherein there is IP transport between the
two GWs servicing the two PSTN Subscribers. So like a normal PSTN to SIP
Call here is the step1 of the call below where both  side are connected
:

Orig PSTN    Ingress GW   SIP Server   Egress GW    Dest PSTN
                        GW1          SPS          GW2
             ------------>------------>------------>------------>
             IAM          Invite       Invite       IAM

             <-----------<------------<------------<------------
             ACM          180 Ringing  180 Ringing  ACM

             <-----------<------------<------------<------------
             ANM          200 OK       200 OK       ANM

                          ------------>------------>
                          ACK          ACK
After the above A to B is connection is setup then Receiving side PSTN
subscriber sends a ISUP Message called USR ( User-to-User-Information
only relevant to ITU-TS not ANSI SS7 ). This USR information may be
expiration of the Called and calling party's credit in case they are
prepaid subscribers or the USR message may be update of account balance
as well. The ISUP USR Message is carried over the IP n/w as a SIP INFO
Message with ISUP Message body to the originating side. =20

<-----------<------------<------------<------------
             USR          INFO         INFO         USR
                          ISUP MIME    ISUP MIME
                          USR          USR

                          ------------>------------>
                          200 OK       200 OK

             ------------>------------>------------>------------>
             USR          INFO         INFO         USR
                          ISUP MIME    ISUP MIME
                          USR          USR

                         <------------<------------
                          200 OK       200 OK
Also I guess you are probably aware that the draft is now a RFC 2976 and
also I would suggest that also go thru RFC 3398 for more use cases of
ISUP to SIP Mapping.=20

Hi Erkki,

If the first hop edge proxy (the P-CSCF) doesn't support outbound, it
will not add the 'ob' parameter to the Path header, so the registrar
will ignore the reg-id parameter in the request.

hope this helps.
thanks,
-rohan

Hi,

To make the discussion about the outbound transport issues more
concrete, here is some strawman text for the "FASTEST" direction.

thanks,
-rohan

PROPOSED TEXT:
Use of outbound with UDP flows prevents messages larger than 1300
bytes from being delivered using TCP as described in Section 18.1.1
RFC 3261.  Use of outbound in conjunction with UDP flows in
environments where requests are expected to be larger than this size
is therefore NOT RECOMMENDED.

G'day,

I work for Westinghouse Rail Systems Australia, and am investigating
standard subscription protocols for use in our SCADA product line. SCADA
systems (centralised monitoring and control of remote equipment such as
power distribution systems) tend to rely a lot on subscription to push
data to users and to distributed services. SIP has come up as a possible
way to do this, however at present given my reading of rfc3265 I suspect
it is not appropriate and would like to confirm with this mailing list.

rfc3265 indicates that it is not a general purpose subscription
mechanism. Specific weaknesses I see include
* There is no obvious way to subscribe to a HTTP resource. Subscriptions
are sent to the combination of a SIP url and event package identifier.
* Proxies are used for transport through firewall-intensive networks,
but do not participate in the subscription. A restful architecture is
constrained to support layering, whereby muliple clients who share a
proxy might enjoy a multicasting effect through the proxy
* Data flow is limited by explicit timers. In a SCADA or stock quote
system old data degrades rapidly in value with time, and the objective
is to get as close as possible to immediate notifications. The maximum
notification rate should be related to available bandwidth, or at worst
to network latency
* Subscriptions are refreshed individually at a client-specified rate.
In a SCADA environment we are likely to have thousands of subscriptions
active between a client and server. The client-specified rate may be
used as a keep-alive so that the client can detect server death and
recreate its subscriptions on another cluster member. I believe it is
better for the client to send exactly no renewals. Keep-alive should be
sent from the server only, and at a long reliable rate when no data has
been transmitted over the subscription during the keep-alive interval.

Before I started my quest for an appropriate protocol, I wrote up a
strawman which may be viewed here:
http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/draft-carlyle-sena-00.txt

If I am unable to resolve the issues I have with existing standards I
intend to refine and propose the straw-man as a potential
standards-track rfc. I hope to find that an appropriate subscription
mechanism already exists. I see defining a new one as something of a
last resort.

Security is still a weakness of my protocol when NOTIFY and PATCHNOTIFY
are used. HTTP may only support the EXPIRE notification model without
additional trust mechanisms becoming better understood and deployed.

I believe I have already ruled out the use of XMPP's XEP-0060 given the
way that it makes use of an intermediatary to manage subscriptions but
does not summarise subscription data for slow clients:

I just wanted to point out that at  everyone of the recent IETF  
meetings Rohan and I have gotten strong feedback from the WG that  
they want this done soon so I feel pretty strongly we should be on  
the route Rohan described as "Fastest". Some of the comments for  
alternatives from this I think I would argue with but that is  
probably not very relevant if people feel they can live with the text  
below and just get outbound finished.

I see. I think it would be good to exactly add this example.

In some sense it refers to the discussion we have in the Geopriv L7 LCP 
work. An approach of requesting a reference to a PIDF-LO from the LIS by 
the end host, then adding the reference to a SIP message compared to the 
approach of a LIS providing the reference to a proxy that then adds then 
the reference sounds somewhat similar except that the latter one is more 
complicated since the end user is not involved at all which limits the 
user's ability to influence something.

After the discussions we had in the past and the challenges we 
investigated I essentially see only one reasonable option: 
Copy-and-paste the text from Section 6 of 
http://tools.ietf.org/wg/geopriv/draft-schulzrinne-geopriv-locationref-00.txt

I think that everything else is a huge privacy problem.

I was actually referring only to the case where the proxy uses some 
information to conclude that location information has to be added.

I see only two ways to get this accomplished in a way that there is not 
a huge privacy problem:

a) Applicability statement to focus on the emergency service case only. 
There, the emergency service identifier (or in some cases the emergency 
service number) can help to determine the context. Does not work in the 
general case.

b) SIP UAC attaches a context tag to the SIP signaling message to 
indicate the context. We came up with this idea in SIP SAML since we had 
a similar problem there when it comes to determining the context. See
issue#4: http://www.tschofenig.priv.at:8080/saml-sip/issue4

In our past discussions I saw two aspects:

a) SIP is per-se accepted as a using protocol.
b) HTTP is per-default not accepted as using protocol.

For (a): The proxy server/LIS is not the same as the LS/Presence Server 
in my view. Please see the recent discussion on this topic (pointing to 
terminology).

For (b): I know no fundamental problem to get HTTP to perform a 
dereferencing step from a reference to an LO.

As such, in order to be sensible to the past discussions I would 
appreciate if the strange RFC 3693 terminology is not stressed too much 
in this document based on what we already know after the long, long 
discussions we had. It is not an important and major change though.

Hmmm. Please find the already specified the rules in Section 8 of 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-geopriv-policy-08.txt

I am not referring to a new thing.

I think everything is correct if you delete the following sentence: 
"Such entities MUST NOT alter the rule set.".

But how long should the LIS/Proxy Server keep the reference? You cannot 
expect the reference to stay there for ever.

You can always say that

"
The reference that is added by the Proxy is keep for an unspecified 
period of time. The Location Recipient that performs the dereferencing 
step should not make any assumption about the    ability to resolve the 
reference. The reference creating entity might at any point in time 
decide to destroy the reference as part of a garbage collection process. 
It is RECOMMENDED that the reference that points to the Location Object 
is stored for at least 2 minutes.
"

I think we need to state something. I know that it is not perfect.
We do, however, also want to let people realize that a proxy doing some 
actions on behalf of the SIP UAC is not an ideal solution and suffers 
from a number of problems.

Here is my suggestion:

* Non-Emergency Based Scenarios

If the location-based routing has to be performed then TLS is MUST. 
S/MIME is not possible.

For the other case S/MIME is a SHOULD. SHOULD only because it is 
difficult to use.

* Emergency Based Scenarios

SHOULD for TLS; fall-back to non-security version if TLS does not work
S/MIME non possible.

I agree that the location by reference / location by value case should 
not be treated differently with respect to this security issue.

Ok. I can try something.

That's true. The LbyV case for the end point is easy.

But this only works if the end host is allowed to interact with the LIS 
when putting anything meaningful in there. This, however, depends on the 
outcome of the Geopriv L7 work. I would argue that this is outside the 
scope of this document (for good reasons)

For the case where the proxy adds the reference I see the need to put a 
randomized identity in there, if it does not harm. In scope.

I think it would be useful to distinguish these cases.

Ideally, it would be great to use S/MIME to allow true protection of 
location information (Additional remark: If location-based routing by 
proxies is not used; again, if the end point determines the ultimate 
target then it does not need to consult proxies todo so.).

Now, the problem we see to in various places is that due to retargeting 
and forking even the idea of S/MIME usage is not only difficult (due to 
the lack of the deployed certs) but also due to technical issues.

This is not particularly good.

I see only one solution: Don't sent location with the initial message. 
Wait until you see to whom you are talking to. Send location later.

Is this something that could work?

See my response above.

Regardless of the using protocol discussion I don't think that Section 7 
  is too valuable. For example, why is 'Single Message Transfer' 
anything useful from a privacy or security point of view?

Well, maybe I got a bit frustrated on this topic...

The reason why I suggest the change is that we provide two ways to keep 
location private: First, we offer access control solutions using 
policies. Second, we attach rules as hints how to treat location info.

I think I rephrased it in such a way that it focuses on the second 
aspect by removing 'location often must be kept private.'. If you keep 
this sentence in there then you also need to talk about the access 
control aspect.

I also had problems with the term 'binding' since I didn't quite 
understand what it means.

The arguments against TCP are, if I understand them correctly:

1) TCP may be harder to implement on high fan-out servers because  
naive systems using the socket library run out of sockets fairly  
quickly.

Response: So? Either learn to program using poll/select, or build  
smaller proxies.

2) TCP may cause the consumption of more resources in the mobile  
radio networks (specifically the battery) because of all those  
retransmissions and keepalives.

Response: Of course, outbound with UDP doesn't fare much better in  
this case, as we're still doing keepalives, and TCP's keepalives can  
be turned down or off anyhow.

3) TCP is less desirable for mobile use because each proxy attachment  
requires three more packets (the TCP handshake), and the extra two  
seconds this might require at startup on a slow GPRS link is a show  
stopper.

Response: Big fat hairy deal.

4) TCP's session binding makes it harder to do a distributed proxy  
cluster where SIP state is distributed across the cluster but TCP  
state isn't.

Response: Outbound of course helps with this by giving us the option  
to have multiple explicit entry points into the cluster.

Normally, if one were not able to deliver a response using UDP due to  
the size of that response, one might establish a TCP connection to  
deliver that response.

But unless you do something tricky when using outbound to cross a NAT  
(like have a pre-established TCP connection), you can't just "fall  
back" to TCP for responses from "outbound proxy" to UA, because you'd  
be in a position of trying to initialize a TCP connection going the  
"wrong way" through a NAT.

No.  Outbound using UDP flows prevents the switchover to a
congestion-controlled transport, such as TCP as described in this
quote from RFC 3261:

If a request is within 200 bytes of the path MTU, or if it is larger
than 1300 bytes and the path MTU
is unknown, the request MUST be sent using an RFC 2914 [36] congestion
controlled transport protocol, such as TCP. If this causes a change in
the transport protocol from the one indicated in the top Via, the
value in the top Via MUST be changed. This prevents fragmentation of
messages over UDP and provides congestion control for larger messages.


I think we've already established that if a UA was going to bother
establishing a TCP or TLS flow that there would be no benefit to using
a UDP flow.
thanks,
-rohan

Right... the thing that struck me about this is that there seems to be an
implicit assumption that deployments can "know" how things will be
used. It seems to me that you "know" these things for about as long as
it takes for the assumption to broken and then you're really hosed.
Considering that SIP is not entirely unlike a trash barge hauling stuff
out to the New Jersey outer banks, I'm not very convinced that the
barge isn't going to repeatedly sink unless there's explicit fallback for
those inevitable heavy loads.

Does there exist any plausible scenario where that won't be the
case? Let's take into consideration that the time horizon here
should be viewed in the decades rather than in the months.

No.  Outbound using UDP flows prevents the switchover to a
congestion-controlled transport, such as TCP as described in this
quote from RFC 3261:

    If a request is within 200 bytes of the path MTU, or if it is
larger than 1300 bytes and the path MTU is unknown, the request MUST
be sent using an RFC 2914 [36] congestion controlled transport
protocol, such as TCP. If this causes a change in the transport
protocol from the one indicated in the top Via, the value in the top
Via MUST be changed. This prevents fragmentation of messages over UDP
and provides congestion control for larger messages.

thanks,
-rohan

I like this, but it seems to be confusing. Perhaps

"Use of outbound with UDP flows prevents fallback to TCP for messages larger 
than 1300 bytes as described in ..."

Since you are giving guidance anyway, is it possible (and non-contentious) 
to provide a little more help to people who are trying to connect the dots?

"... NOT RECOMMENDED. Environments where large requests are likely to occur 
include ..."

I guess my concern is that NOT RECOMMENDED is roughly a SHOULD NOT, so the 
reader is responsible for figuring out whether the problem will occur or 
not.

Thanks,

Spencer

Perhaps you could trim out the 47 lines of redundant headers?

   rfc3265 indicates that it is not a general purpose subscription
   mechanism. Specific weaknesses I see include
   * There is no obvious way to subscribe to a HTTP resource. Subscriptions
   are sent to the combination of a SIP url and event package identifier.

Why is this a "weakness", since RFC 3265 is *intended* as a
SIP-specific subscription mechanism?

   * Proxies are used for transport through firewall-intensive networks,
   but do not participate in the subscription. A restful architecture is
   constrained to support layering, whereby muliple clients who share a
   proxy might enjoy a multicasting effect through the proxy

A proxy *by definition* doesn't participate in any of the transactions
it forwards.  But you could define an appropriate agent that would
forward data to multiple supplies.

BTW, what is a "restful" architecture?  And what do you mean by
"layering"?

   * Data flow is limited by explicit timers. In a SCADA or stock quote
   system old data degrades rapidly in value with time, and the objective
   is to get as close as possible to immediate notifications. The maximum
   notification rate should be related to available bandwidth, or at worst
   to network latency

RFC 3265 does not specify any timers for rate-limiting of subscription
notifications, and most implementations do not do much rate-limiting..

   * Subscriptions are refreshed individually at a client-specified rate.
   In a SCADA environment we are likely to have thousands of subscriptions
   active between a client and server.

It seems like you might want to bundle those subscriptions into a
single subscription, if you are using the RFC 3265 model.  Maintaining
thousands of *anything* in a protocol usually indicates an opportunity
for optimization.

   The client-specified rate may be
   used as a keep-alive so that the client can detect server death and
   recreate its subscriptions on another cluster member. I believe it is
   better for the client to send exactly no renewals.

In RFC 3265, subscription refresh is used so that the server can
detect client death.  I suspect that any other subscription protocol
will need a similar mechanism.

   If I am unable to resolve the issues I have with existing standards I
   intend to refine and propose the straw-man as a potential
   standards-track rfc.

Do you have any reason to believe that there are others out there who
would like to interoperate using a new mechanism?

Dale

Hi Rohan,

Just to verify that I understood your answer correctly:

>If the first hop edge proxy (the P-CSCF) doesn't support outbound, it
>will not add the 'ob' parameter to the Path header, so the registrar
>will ignore the reg-id parameter in the request.

... and when the registrar ignores the reg-id within REGISTER it will
not add the Supported: outbound header to the 200 OK response.
And when the UA finds that the 200 OK does not contain Supported:
outbound
it finds out that it will not be able to try multiple registrations.

Please tell if you meant this or something different.

Clearly this does not apply to Outbound at all, since there the TCP
connection is anyway maintained persistently in order to be reachable
behind a NAT. So, at least from a mobile client point of view, this is
not an issue.=20

I happen to agree with Dean's suggested responses, I'm just offering more 
detail on this one.

The default in the TCP specifications is a two-hour keepalive, turned off. 
If your TCP stack does something else, one might wonder "why?"

When we are not retransmitting UDP packets, concern about TCP 
retransmissions makes sense, but we are talking about SIP signaling, so 
needed retransmissions need to happen in either UDP or TCP.

Assuming that there's not a double-secret UDP retransmission mechanism that 
doesn't use battery power...

:-)

Spencer

Hi,

I am in favor of FASTEST, however I am not sure the text being proposed
is necessary. How does outbound prohibit the change to TCP?

This seems to be an issue of how the algorithm for generating the flow
token is implemented and those in outbound are informational from my
reading. Thus, as long as the edge proxy utilizes an algorithm which
generates a flow token which resolves to a source IP and Port and
Destination IP and Port the edge proxy would be free to determine which
transport protocol to use.

If a NAT is present, the UA will need to establish both a UDP and TCP
flow to the edge proxy to allow inbound requests on either. If a NAT is
not present, then the UA need only establish one flow as the edge proxy
can initial the other flow if needed.

Kevin

No.  Outbound using UDP flows prevents the switchover to a
congestion-controlled transport, such as TCP as described in this quote
from RFC 3261:

    If a request is within 200 bytes of the path MTU, or if it is larger
than 1300 bytes and the path MTU is unknown, the request MUST be sent
using an RFC 2914 [36] congestion controlled transport protocol, such as
TCP. If this causes a change in the transport protocol from the one
indicated in the top Via, the value in the top Via MUST be changed. This
prevents fragmentation of messages over UDP and provides congestion
control for larger messages.

thanks,
-rohan

Practical question: In which kind of environment the messages could be
expected to always be below 1300 bytes? Some kind of isolated island of
SIP where all endpoints and their features are under control? Clearly,
this won't work in any real inter-domain Internet deployment, and might
actually make such a thing even harder to achieve. Isn't this just evil
from the perspective of long-term well-being and deployment of SIP? :O=20

Hi,

I submitted -06 of outbound so folks can at least take a look to see
that the many small changes we have agreed to have been incorporated.
I also included the proposed text for FASTEST, since the draft would
need significant surgery anyway if we go with CLEANEST.

Until it appears in the archive you can find it here:
http://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/fluffy/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-06.html
http://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/fluffy/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-06.txt

thanks,

This is an excellent point. I think you are correct; since a UA cannot 
differentiate between a first and third party offerless invite, it would 
need to always construct its offer with ICE attributes, regardless of 
the presence of the option tag. In this case, the option tag is 
pointless since its presence has no bearing on the processing the UA 
will execute. It would be nice to be able to differentiate the third vs. 
first party case, but there is nothing for that right now.

The REGISTER case is definitely useful, and there is a not-so-useful but 
possible application with Require in an INVITE.

In the REGISTER case, I think its probably *slightly* more correct to 
use a capability and not an option tag. This is because you could have a 
third party registration, with different ICE support for different 
contacts in the registration.

FWIW I am very sour these days on third party registrations; indeed, 
I've gone as far as to propose deprecating them as part of UA's 
compliant to route-construct:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-route-construct-02.txt

That said, we do need an option tag in the case of a Require header in 
an INVITE. Per the other thread I think I've concluded its not useful in 
an offerless INVITE. For presence documents, either would work (though 
an option tag is simpler since it doesn't require a prescaps extension).

So, my proposal would be to define both, and use the callee cap in 
registrations. Option tag would just be for Require.

Why is 430 limited to connection-oriented transports? If the edge proxy cho=
oses to maintain state also for UDP, it can detect failed flows for UDP too

Hi,

I submitted -06 of outbound so folks can at least take a look to see
that the many small changes we have agreed to have been incorporated.
I also included the proposed text for FASTEST, since the draft would
need significant surgery anyway if we go with CLEANEST.

Until it appears in the archive you can find it here:

All,

It seems that RFC 3261 does not say anything about the number of times 
that a 
header is allowed to apear in a request or response. The ABNF states:

Request        =  Request-Line
                  *( message-header )
                  CRLF
                  [ message-body ]

message-header  =  (Accept
                /  Accept-Encoding
                        :
                        :
                /  Accept-Language
                /  extension-header) CRLF

Which means that any header can appear any number of times. The text of 
the RFC
does not seem to modify this in any way. So what does this mean? Is it 
indeed
the case that a header may appear any number of times?

Cheers,

Frank

=20
In terms of pure grammar, headers can appear any number of times.
=20
In practice, it only makes sense for some headers to appear
multiple times (e.g. Route, Record-Route, Contact).
And for some headers, an appearance of more than once
has no use (well, not at the moment) (e.g. To and From).

Hi Frank,
=20
I feel section "7.3.1 Header Field Format" is quite clear
(with the example of Route headers) about equivalence.
=20
   defined in Section 7.3).  It MUST be possible to combine the multiple
   header field rows into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without
   changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent
   field-value to the first, each separated by a comma.  The exceptions
   to this rule are the WWW-Authenticate, Authorization, Proxy-
   Authenticate, and Proxy-Authorization header fields.  Multiple header
   field rows with these names MAY be present in a message, but since
   their grammar does not follow the general form listed in Section 7.3,
   they MUST NOT be combined into a single header field row.
=20
....   Implementations MUST be able to process multiple header field =
rows
....   with the same name in any combination of the =
single-value-per-line or
....   comma-separated value forms.

So it has to handle all of the above.=20
And the dotted part (....)  is the most important.
=20
>>unspecified and therefore completely dependent on twoe implementations =

>>that happen to have taken the same approach. Although there's nothing=20

I feel it only requires that two implementations comply with section =
7.3.1.
=20
All implementations need the flexibility to be able to handle the
multiple header-values in combination with multiple sip headers
(of the same type).  If they don't, they don't comply.
=20
Regards,
Attila

Hi Atilla.=20

I agree that common sense should prevail when implementing this sort of =
thing,=20
but it would also be useful to specify things in an exact manner to =
prevent=20
problems.=20

As an example, you mention the Contact header as being one of those =
headers=20
that could be present more than once. The specified way provide multiple =

Contact addresses is through a comma-separated list of addresses in one=20
Contact header. The theoretical alternative could indeed be to provide=20
multiple Contact headers, each with one Contact address, but this is=20
unspecified and therefore completely dependent on twoe implementations=20
that happen to have taken the same approach. Although there's nothing=20
fundamentally wrong with multiple ways in which the same can be =
achieved,=20
this should be specified and if possible avoided.=20

In terms of pure grammar, headers can appear any number of times.=20

Subject: [Sip] Multiplicity of SIP headers
Importance: High


All,=20

It seems that RFC 3261 does not say anything about the number of times =
that a=20
header is allowed to apear in a request or response. The ABNF states:=20

Request        =3D  Request-Line=20
                 *( message-header )=20
                 CRLF=20
                 [ message-body ]=20

message-header  =3D  (Accept=20
               /  Accept-Encoding=20
                       :=20
                       :=20
               /  Accept-Language=20
               /  extension-header) CRLF=20

Which means that any header can appear any number of times. The text of =
the RFC=20
does not seem to modify this in any way. So what does this mean? Is it =
indeed=20
the case that a header may appear any number of times?=20

Cheers,=20

They, in this case, is I believe one organisation.

The proposal was referred back until the requirements are known - in any
case 3GPP cannot define option-tags.

Hi Steve,
=20
having certificates for user registration over multiple hops on a
registrar seems an interesting approach. The possibility to have a local
authentication service on the user agent would help here, but in most
scenarios, the user agent itself will not possess the domain certificate
according to RFC4474.
=20
Two comments to the transport of credentials. You mentioned that SIP
identity itself does not provide for certificate transport. We are
currently working on an update of a draft targeting a BCP for credential
transport in SIP using SIP identity
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fries-sip-identity-usage-bcp-
00.txt). Our draft also mentions the usage of SIP SAML to transport an
assertion or a reference to an assertion, which may be interesting in
your scenario as well. A SAML assertion could be provided by a local
server, which in turn may be used to register the UA.=20
=20
Ciao
    Steffen

	Some industries and organizations have invested in PKI, and thus
have certificates available for authentication. We would like to
leverage those credentials for SIP authentication. Using certificates
instead of UICCs or other credentials is attractive for certain
deployment models.
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-01
.txt describes some requirements related to this issue, as well as a
review of previous and related work. We have received good feedback
offline from authors of related work which were incorporated into the
latest draft.

	Thanks,

Note I disagree that we have established this but I think it is more  
or less irrelevant to the discussion on what we should do here.

Hi,
There're many implementations when transportation on UDP fails or =
transation timeout without response it will automatically try TCP =
connection. Is this mandated in any RFCs? I think RFC3261 says if =
transaction timeouts it should go to terminated state.
=20
Is this implementation a violation to RFC3261?
=20
Thanks,
Bruce

Hi

Section 8 of the draft says: For TCP or TLS over TCP flows, determining
if the first octet of the next message in a stream is SIP or STUN is
still straightforward.  As with any stream-based protocol,
implementations need to be prepared to receive STUN messages which cross
a stream buffer boundary, and SIP and STUN messages which share the same
stream buffer.

Can anyone please elaborate more on demultiplexing of SIP and STUN
message in case of TCP? If the STUN message is in middle of the read
buffer, how can we demux these packets?

Regards
Srikanth

The STUN header (not sure that is the correct term) is fixed size - 20 
bytes if I remember correctly.

If you receive one byte that indicates this is STUN then you continue 
reading from the socket until you have received (at least) 19 more 
bytes. From the first 20 bytes you can figure out the total length of 
the STUN request.

1. (obvious but) only look STUN response for it
   when you've sent a STUN request.

2. There is a STUN magic cookie
   (not in RFC3489 but in =
http://www.heise.de/netze/rfc/drafts/draft-ietf-behave-rfc3489bis-05.shtm=
l)

3. There is your transaction ID.

Attila

I'm not sure about the text in the draft is all clear but ...

A STUN message can not occur in the middle of a SIP message and  
likewise you can not have a SIP in the middle of the STUN. The  
streams, the whole messages has to be inserted into the stream before  
starting a new message regardless of the type of the message.

What I mean "in middle of the read buffer" is, For ex: In the first read
I received a partial SIP message and in the next TCP read if I receive
the remaining of the SIP message and followed by STUN message (in single
read, and I believe this is possible in TCP communication), then
demuxing will be difficult unless we parse the entire SIP message.

I'm not sure about the text in the draft is all clear but ...

A STUN message can not occur in the middle of a SIP message and likewise
you can not have a SIP in the middle of the STUN. The streams, the whole
messages has to be inserted into the stream before starting a new
message regardless of the type of the message.

I have two major reasons for this opinion:

- After seeing the recent comments, the option to support
  UDP flows together with STUN keepalive really does not
  make sense. It is prone to fail with big enough messages,
  introduces a whole bunch of unnecessary complexity and
  further on is a burden for the battery consumption of
  mobile UAs (at least compared less frequent TCP keepalive).
  All practical examples of SIP use cases I have seen
  anyway generate messages exceeding 1300 bytes, for one
  purpose or another, sooner or later.

- After having a look into separate drafts written for
  mid-dialog failover, I believe it would be a wrong decision
  to approve Outbound as soon as possible and leave this
  rather important mid-dialog case to be solved separately.
  It does not make sense to split the high availability
  features to two drafts: multiple registration to Outbound=20
  and mid-dialog failover to some bytes if I remember correctly.

  It does not make sense to split the high availability
  features to two drafts: multiple registration to Outbound=20
  and mid-dialog failover to some other draft, especially
  when the failover draft is expected to have an impact to=20
  Outbound. Instead the drafts should be combined the other
  way around. There should be one draft for outbound TCP
  connection maintenance and another for high availability
  by multiple registrations TOGETHER WITH mid-dialog failover.


If a version of Outbound will be frozen with UDP support
but without mid-dialog support, I believe there would either
be no deployment for the specified features (UDP) or that
the deployed implementations would lack those useful high
availability features.

For both cases: is there any point for speeding the process up=20
(even if there REALLY is an urgent need for these solutions)=20
if the result is that the agreed solution would not work well
enough ?

More or less this would be the right direction. However
I still belive that the outbound connection draft could
be the one specifying the Path handling. My proposal would
be to move the reg-id and multiple registration part of
Outbound to the mid-dialog failover draft.

It has bothered me and my colleagues a long time that the
Outbound draft has bundled together two different things
that actually are orthogonal, both as problems and as
solutions too. The only reason to keep them together in
one single spec is that in some environments it makes
sense to use them together, but the problem is that in
some other environments separation would be desirable.

Those two items could be described like this:

- A mechanism with which an UA would be able to maintain a
  persistent flow through a NAT/firewall towards an outbound=20
  proxy, keep the flow alive and monitor its state. The
  mechanism would also define how the authoritative and edge=20
  proxies would use the persistent flow and Path header for=20
  forwarding incoming requests to the UA.

- A mechanism with which an UA instance would be able to achieve
  high availability towards its home domain, by maintaining
  multiple simultaneous registrations without the need to
  receive multiple forked copies of a single incoming request.

If a version of Outbound will be frozen with UDP support
but without mid-dialog support, I believe there would either
be no deployment for the specified features (UDP) or that
the deployed implementations would lack those useful high

More or less this would be the right direction. However
I still belive that the outbound connection draft could
be the one specifying the Path handling. My proposal would
be to move the reg-id and multiple registration part of
Outbound to the mid-dialog failover draft.

It has bothered me and my colleagues a long time that the
Outbound draft has bundled together two different things
that actually are orthogonal, both as problems and as
solutions too. The only reason to keep them together in
one single spec is that in some environments it makes
sense to use them together, but the problem is that in
some other environments separation would be desirable.

Those two items could be described like this:

- A mechanism with which an UA would be able to maintain a
  persistent flow through a NAT/firewall towards an outbound=20
  proxy, keep the flow alive and monitor its state. The
  mechanism would also define how the authoritative and edge=20
  proxies would use the persistent flow and Path header for=20
  forwarding incoming requests to the UA.

- A mechanism with which an UA instance would be able to achieve
  high availability towards its home domain, by maintaining
  multiple simultaneous registrations without the need to
  receive multiple forked copies of a single incoming request.
  This resiliency would enable the UA to protect its connectivity
  against edge proxy failures or access network connectivity=20
  failures. This mechanism would introduce the reg-id parameter
  to Contact and allow the authoritative proxy to forward
  requests to the UA using the set of registered Contacts
  and corresponding Paths.

The high availability draft should be able to refer to the
outbound connections draft, so that depending on the case
each of the multiple registrations might or might not set=20
up a persistent flow towards the outbound proxy. The
high availability (including mid-dialog failover) mechanisms=20
should be specified so that they would work regardless of=20
whether the UA uses persistent connections towards edge=20
proxies or not. Of course persistent connections would
be a must for NAT/firewall traversal, if that is the part
of problem space in the specific environment.

Please find the result below:

4.  User Agent Mechanisms

4.1  Instance ID Creation

   [[ As in Outbound-06, no changes needed ]]

4.2  Initial and Subsequent Registrations

   Registration requests, other than those described in Section 4.2.1,
   MUST include an instance-id media feature tag as specified in
   Section 4.1. Registration requests MUST also include the 'ob'
   URI parameter in the Contact URI. With 'ob' parameter the UA
   indicates that it wants to maintain a persistent flow towards
   the outbound proxy which receives the REGISTER request from the
   UA. The edge proxy is expected to use this flow when forwarding
   incoming requests towards the UA.

   UA MUST send the REGISTER request over a reliable transport
   protocol such as TCP. The connection over which the REGISTER
   was sent will be used as the persistent flow. The UA MUST
   not close the connection until it deregisters itself. Further
   on the UA must monitor the state of the flow and keep it alive
   as specified in section 4.4 of this specification.

   The UAC MUST indicate that it supports the Path header [RFC3327]
   mechanism, by including the 'path' option-tag in a Supported header
   field value in its REGISTER requests.  Other than optionally
   examining the Path vector in the response, this is all that is
   required of the UAC to support Path.

   The UAC MAY examine successful registrations for the presence of an
   'outbound' option-tag in a Supported header field value.  Presence of
   this option-tag indicates that the registrar is compliant with this
   specification, and that any edge proxies which need to partcipate are
   also compliant.

   Finally, re-registrations which merely refresh an existing valid
   registration MUST be sent over the same flow as the original
   registration.

4.3  Sending Requests

   When a UA is about to send a request, it first performs normal
   processing to select the next hop URI.  The UA can use a variety of
   techniques to compute the route set and accordingly the next hop URI.
   Discussion of these techniques is outside the scope of this document
   but could include mechanisms specified in RFC 3608 [RFC3608] (Service
   Route) and [I-D.rosenberg-sip-route-construct].

   The UA performs normal DNS resolution on the next hop URI (as
   described in RFC 3263 [RFC3263]) to find a protocol, IP address, and
   port.  For non-TLS protocols, if the UA has an existing flow to this
   IP address, and port with the correct protocol, then the UA MUST use
   the existing connection.  For TLS protocols, there MUST also be a
   match between the host production in the next hop and one of the URIs
   contained in the subjectAltName in the peer certificate.  If the UA
   cannot use one of the existing flows, then it SHOULD form a new flow
   by sending a datagram or opening a new connection to the next hop, as
   appropriate for the transport protocol. Note that flows not created
   by registration will be closed when the related dialog is closed.
   While such a flow is open the UA SHOULD monitor its state and keep
   it alive by sending the keepalive messages.

4.4  Detecting Flow Failure

   The UA needs to detect when a specific flow fails.  The UA actively
   tries to detect failure by periodically sending keepalive messages
   using one of the techniques described in Section 4.4.1. and =20
   4.4.2. If a flow has failed, the UA follows the procedures
   in Section 4.2 to form a new flow to replace the failed one.
   The time between keepalive requests when using TCP-
   based transports SHOULD be a random number between 95 and 120
   seconds.  These times MAY be configurable.  Issues such as battery
   consumption might motivate longer keepalive intervals.

      Note on selection of time values: For TCP, the 120
      seconds upper bound was chosen based on the idea that for a good
      user experience, failures normally will be detected in this amount
      of time and a new connection set up.  Operators that wish to
      change the relationship between load on servers and the expected
      time that a user might not receive inbound communications will
      probably adjustAs in Outbound-06, no changes needed ]]

4.2  Initial and Subsequent Registrations

   Registration requests, other than those described in Section 4.2.1,
   MUST include an instance-id media feature tag as specified in
   Section 4.1. Registration requests MUST also include the 'ob'
   URI parameter in the Contact URI. With 'ob' parameter the UA
   indicates that it wants to maintain a persistent flow towards
   the outbound proxy which receives the REGISTER request from the
   UA. The edge proxy is expected to use this flow when forwarding
   incoming requests towards the UA.

   UA MUST send the REGISTER request over a reliable transport
   protocol such as TCP. The connection over which the REGISTER
   was sent will be used as the persistent flow. The UA MUST
   not close the connection until it deregisters itself. Further
   on the UA must monitor the state of the flow and keep it alive
   as specified in section 4.4 of this specification.

   The UAC MUST indicate that it supports the Path header [RFC3327]
   mechanism, by including the 'path' option-tag in a Supported header
   field value in its REGISTER requests.  Other than optionally
   examining the Path vector in the response, this is all that is
   required of the UAC to support Path.

   The UAC MAY examine successful registrations for the presence of an
   'outbound' option-tag in a Supported header field value.  Presence of
   this option-tag indicates that the registrar is compliant with this
   specification, and that any edge proxies which need to partcipate are
   also compliant.

   Finally, re-registrations which merely refresh an existing valid

   registration.

   IP address, and port with the correct protocol, then the UA MUST use
   the existing connection.  For TLS protocols, there MUST also be a

   contained in the subjectAltName in the peer certificate.  If the UA
   cannot use one of the existing flows, then it SHOULD form a new flow
   by sending a datagram or opening a new connection to the next hop, as
   appropriate for the transport protocol. Note that flows not created
   by registration will be closed when the related dialog is closed.
   While such a flow is open the UA SHOULD monitor its state and keep
   it alive by sending the keepalive messages.

4.4  Detecting Flow Failure

   The UA needs to detect when a specific flow fails.  The UA actively
   tries to detect failure by periodically sending keepalive messages
   using one of the techniques described in Section 4.4.1. and =20
   4.4.2. If a flow has failed, the UA follows the procedures
   in Section 4.2 to form a new flow to replace the failed one.
   The time between keepalive requests when using TCP-
   based transports SHOULD be a random number between 95 and 120
   seconds.  These times MAY be configurable.  Issues such as battery
   consumption might motivate longer keepalive intervals.

      Note on selection of time values: For TCP, the 120
      seconds upper bound was chosen based on the idea that for a good
      user experience, failures normally will be detected in this amount
      of time and a new connection set up.  Operators that wish to
      change the relationship between load on servers and the expected
      time that a user might not receive inbound communications will
      probably adjust this time.  The 95 seconds lower bound was chosen
      so that the jitter introduced will result in a relatively even
      load on the servers after 30 minutes.

4.4.1  Keepalive with TCP KEEPALIVE

   User Agents that are capable of generating per-connection TCP
   keepalives with timer values consistent with those in this section
   SHOULD use TCP keepalives for TCP-based flows.

4.4.2  Keepalive with CRLF

   User Agents that are not capable of generating per-connection TCP
   keeplalives with timer values consistent with those in this section
   or are using some other transport protocol than TCP SHOULD send CRLF
   sequences as keepalive messages.

4.4.3  Flow Recovery

   When a flow created during registration fails, the
   UA needs to form a new flow to replace the old flow and replace any
   registrations that were previously sent over this flow. This is done=20
   in much the same way as forming a brand new
   flow as described in Section 4.2; however, if there is a failure in
   forming this flow, the UA needs to wait a certain amount of time
   before retrying to form a flow to this particular next hop.

   The amount of time to wait depends if the previous attempt at
   establishing a flow was successful.  For the purposes of this
   section, a flow is considered successful if outbound registration
   succeeded and keepalives have not timed out for min-regtime seconds
   (default of 120 seconds) after a registration. If a flow is
established
   and is alive after this amount of time, the number of consecutive
   registration failures is set to zero.  Each time a flow fails before
   two minutes, the number of consecutive registration failures is
   incremented by one. =20

   The number of seconds to wait is computed in the following way. This
   algorithm allows the UA to maintain multiple flows but it also
applies
   even if the UA maintains one single flow towards its home proxy. Note
   that the techniques needed to maintain multiple flows are not in
scope
   of this specification but may be defined within another document. If
   all of the flows to every URI in the outbound proxy set have failed,
   the base time is set to 30 seconds; otherwise, in the case where at
   least one of the flows has not failed, the base time is set to 90
   seconds.  The wait time is computed by taking two raised to the power
   of the number of consecutive registration failures for that URI, and
   multiplying this by the base time, up to a maximum of 1800 seconds.

   wait-time =3D min( max-time, (base-time * (2 ^ =
consecutive-failures)))

   These times MAY be configurable in the UA.  The four times are:
   o  max-time with a default of 1800 seconds
   o  base-time-all-fail with a default of 30 seconds
   o  base-time-not-failed with a default of 90 seconds
   o  min-regtime with a default of 120 seconds
   For example, if the base time is 30 seconds, and there were three
   failures, then the wait time is min(1800,30*(2^3)) or 240 seconds.
   The delay time is computed by selecting a uniform random time between
   50 and 100 percent of the wait time.  The UA MUST wait for the value
   of the delay time before trying another registration to form a new
   flow for that URI.

   To be explicitly clear on the boundary conditions:  when the UA boots
   it immediately tries to register.  If this fails and no registration
   on other flows succeed, the first retry happens somewhere between 30
   and 60 seconds after the failure of the first registration request.
   If the number of consecutive-failures is large enough that the
   maximum of 1800 seconds is reached, the UA will keep trying
   indefinitely with a random time of 15 to 30 minutes (900 to 1800
   seconds) between each attempt.

5.  Edge Proxy Mechanisms

5.1  Processing Register Requests

   When an Edge Proxy receives a registration request with a 'ob'
   URI parameter in the Contact URI, it needs to determine
   if it (the edge proxy) will have to be visited for any subsequent
   requests sent to the user agent identified in the Contact header
   field, or no this time.  The 95 seconds lower bound was chosen
      so that the jitter introduced will result in a relatively even
      load on the servers after 30 minutes.

4.4.1  Keepalive with TCP KEEPALIVE

   User Agents that are capable of generating per-connection TCP
   keepalives with timer values consistent with those in this section
   SHOULD use TCP keepalives for TCP-based flows.

4.4.2  Keepalive with CRLF

   User Agents that are not capable of generating per-connection TCP
   keeplalives with timer values consistent with those in this section

5.1  Processing Register Requests

   When an Edge Proxy receives a registration request with a 'ob'
   URI parameter in the Contact URI, it needs to determine
   if it (the edge proxy) will have to be visited for any subsequent
   requests sent to the user agent identified in the Contact header
   field, or not.  If the Edge Proxy determines that this is the case,
   it inserts its URI in a Path header field value as described in RFC
   3327 [RFC3327].  If the Edge Proxy is the first SIP node after the
   UAC, it either MUST store a "flow token"--containing information
   about the flow from the previous hop--in its Path URI, or reject the
   request.  The flow token MAY be placed in the userpart of the URI.
   In addition, the first node MUST include an 'ob' URI parameter in its
   Path header field value.  If the Edge Proxy is not the first SIP node
   after the UAC it MUST NOT place an 'ob' URI parameter in a Path
   header field value.  The Edge Proxy can determine if it is the first
   hop by examining the Via header field

5.2  Generating Flow Tokens

   [[ As in Outbound-06, no changes needed ]]

5.3  Forwarding Requests

   When an Edge Proxy receives a request, it applies normal routing
   procedures with the following addition.  If the Edge Proxy receives a
   request where the edge proxy is the host in the topmost Route header
   field value, and the Route header contains a flow token, the proxy
   compares the flow in the flow token with the source of the request.
   If these refer to the same flow, the Edge Proxy removes the Route
   header and continues processing the request.  Otherwise, if the top-
   most Route header refers to the Edge Proxy and contains a valid flow
   identifier token created by this proxy, the proxy MUST remove the
   Route header and forward the request over the 'logical flow'
   identified by the flow token, that is known to deliver data to the
   specific target UA instance.  For connection-oriented transports, if
   the flow no longer exists the proxy SHOULD send a 430 (Flow Failed)
   response to the request.

      The advantage to a stateless approach to managing the flow
      information is that there is no state on the Edge Proxy that
      requires clean up or that has to be synchronized with the
      registrar.

   Proxies which used one of the two algorithms described in this
   document to form a flow token follow the procedures below to
   determine the correct flow.

   Algorithm 1: The proxy base64 decodes the user part of the Route
      header.  For a TCP-based transport, if a connection specified by
      the file descriptor is present and the creation time of the file
      descriptor matches the creation time encoded in the Route header,
      the proxy forwards the request over that connection.  For a UDP-
      based transport, the proxy forwards the request from the encoded
      file descriptor to the source IP address and port.

   Algorithm 2: To decode the flow token, take the flow identifier in
      the user portion of the URI and base64 decode it, then verify the
      HMAC is correct by recomputing the HMAC and checking it matches.
      If the HMAC is not correct, the proxy SHOULD send a 403
      (Forbidden) response.  If the HMAC is correct then the proxy
      SHOULD forward the request on the flow that was specified by the
      information in the flow identifier.  If this flow no longer
      exists, the proxy SHOULD send a 430 (Flow Failed) response to the
      request.

6.  Registrar Mechanisms: Processing REGISTER Requests

   This specification updates the definition of a binding in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261] Section 10 and RFC 3327 [RFC3327] Section 5.3.

   When the Contact of REGISTER request contains an 'ob' URI parameter
   and +sip.instance media feature parameter, the corresponding
   binding is between an AOR and the the instance-id (from the=20
   +sip.instance media feature parameter). For such a binding with 'ob'
   URI parameter, the registrar still stores the Contact header field
   value URI with the binding, but does not consider the Contact URI for
   comparison purposes. If the Contact of REGISTER request contains an
   'ob' URI parameter but not any +sip.instance media feature parameter,
   the registrar simply ignores the 'ob' parameter. The registrar MUST=20
   be prepared to receive, simultaneously for the same AOR, some
   regit.  If the Edge Proxy determines that this is the case,
   it inserts its URI in a Path header field value as described in RFC
   3327 [RFC3327].  If the Edge Proxy is the first SIP node after the
   UAC, it either MUST store a "flow token"--containing information
   about the flow from the previous hop--in its Path URI, or reject the
   request.  The flow token MAY be placed in the userpart of the URI.
   In addition, the first node MUST include an 'ob' URI parameter in its
   Path header field value.  If the Edge Proxy is not the first SIP node
   after the UAC it MUST NOT place an 'ob' URI parameter in a Path
   header field value.  The Edge Proxy can determine if it is the first
   hop by examining the Via header field

   identifier token created by this proxy, the proxy MUST remove the

   identified by the flow token, that is known to deliver data to the
   specific target UA instance.  For connection-oriented transports, if

   response to the request.

      The advantage to a stateless approach to managing the flow

      SHOULD forward the request on the flow that was specified by the
      information in the flow identifier.  If this flow no longer
      exists, the proxy SHOULD send a 430 (Flow Failed) response to the
      request.

   URI parameter, the registrar still stores the Contact header field
   value URI with the binding, but does not consider the Contact URI for
   comparison purposes. If the Contact of REGISTER request contains an
   'ob' URI parameter but not any +sip.instance media feature parameter,
   the registrar simply ignores the 'ob' parameter. The registrar MUST=20
   be prepared to receive, simultaneously for the same AOR, some
   registrations that use instance-id and 'ob' and some registrations=20
   that do not.

   Registrars which implement this specification MUST support the Path
   header mechanism [RFC3327].

   In addition to the normal information stored in the binding record,
   some additional information needs to be stored for any registration
   that contains an instance-id header parameter and a 'ob' URI
parameter in
   the Contact header field value.  First the registrar examines the
first
   Path header field value, if any. If the Path header field exists and
   the first URI does not have an 'ob' URI parameter, the registrar MUST
   ignore the 'ob' parameter in Contact and continue processing the
request
   as if it did not support this specification.  Likewise if the
REGISTER
   request visited an edge proxy, but no Path header field values are
   present, the registrar MUST ignore the 'ob' parameter in Contact URI.
   Specifically, the registrar MUST use RFC 3261 Contact binding rules,
   and MUST NOT include the 'outbound' option-tag in its Supported
   header field.  The registrar can determine if it is the first hop by
   examining the Via header field.

   If the UAC has a direct flow with the registrar, the registrar MUST
   store enough information to uniquely identify the network flow over
   which the request arrived.  For common operating systems with TCP,
   this would typically just be the file descriptor and the time the
   file descriptor was opened.  For common operating systems with UDP
   this would typically be the file descriptor for the local socket that
   received the request, the local interface, and the IP address and
   port number of the remote side that sent the request.  The registrar
   MAY store this information by adding itself to the Path header field
   with an appropriate flow token.

   The registrar MUST also store all the Contact header field
   information including the instance-id parameter and
   SHOULD also store the time at which the binding was last updated.  If
   a Path header field is present, RFC 3327 [RFC3327] requires the
   registrar to store this information as well.  If the registrar
   receives a re-registration, it MUST update any information that
   uniquely identifies the network flow over which the request arrived
   if that information has changed, and SHOULD update the time the
   binding was last updated.

   The Registrar MUST include the 'outbound' option-tag (defined in
   Section (Section 12.1)) in a Supported header field value in its
   responses to REGISTER requests for which it has performed outbound
   processing.  The Registrar MAY be configured with local policy to
   reject any registrations that do not include the instance-id and
   'ob'.  Note that the requirements in this section applies to both
   REGISTER requests received from an Edge Proxy as well as requests
   received directly from the UAC.

   To be compliant with this specification, registrars which can receive
   SIP requests directly from a UAC without intervening edge proxies
   MUST implement the STUN NAT Keepalive usage on its SIP ports as
   described in Section 8.

7.  Authoritative Proxy Mechansims: Forwarding Requests

   When a proxy uses the location service to look up a registration
   binding and then proxies a request to a particular contact, it
   selects a contact to use normally, with a few additional rules:

   o  The proxy MUST NOT populate the target set with more than one
      contact with the same AOR and instance-id at a time.  If a request
      for a particular AOR and instance-id fails with a 430 (Flow
      Failed) response, the proxy SHOULD replace the failed branch with
      another target (if one is available) with the same AOR and
      instance-id, but for different flow, if available.
   o  If the proxy receives a final response from a branch other than a
      408 (Request Timeout) or a 430 (Flow Failed) response, the proxy
      MUST NOT forward the same request to another target representing
      the same AOR and instance-id.  The targetted instance has already
strations that use instance-id and 'ob' and some registrations=20
   that do not.

   Registrars which implement this specification MUST support the Path
   header mechanism [RFC3327].

   In addition to the normal information stored in the binding record,
   some additional information needs to be stored for any registration
   that contains an instance-id header parameter and a 'ob' URI
parameter in
   the Contact header field value.  First the registrar examines the
first
   Path header field value, if any. If the Path header field exists and
   the first URI does not have an 'ob' URI parameter, the registrar MUST
   ignore the 'ob' parameter in Contact and continue processing the
request
   as if it did not support this specification.  Likewise if the
REGISTER
   request visited an edge proxy, but no Path header field values are
   present, the registrar MUST ignore the 'ob' parameter in Contact URI.
   Specifically, the registrar MUST use RFC 3261 Contact binding rules,
   and MUST NOT include the 'outbound' option-tag in its Supported
   header field.  The registrar can determine if it is the first hop by
   examining the Via header field.

   If the UAC has a direct flow with the registrar, the registrar MUST
   store enough information to uniquely identify the network flow over
   which the request arrived.  For common operating systems with TCP,
   this would typically just be the file descriptor and the time the
   file descriptor was opened.  For common operating systems with UDP
   this would typically be the file descriptor for the local socket that
   received the request, the local interface, and the IP address and
   port number of the remote side that sent the request.  The registrar
   MAY store this information by adding itself to the Path header field
   with an appropriate flow token.

7.  Authoritative Proxy Mechansims: Forwarding Requests

   When a proxy uses the location service to look up a registration
   binding and then proxies a request to a particular contact, it
   selects a contact to use normally, with a few additional rules:

   o  The proxy MUST NOT populate the target set with more than one
      contact with the same AOR and instance-id at a time.  If a request
      for a particular AOR and instance-id fails with a 430 (Flow
      Failed) response, the proxy SHOULD replace the failed branch with
      another target (if one is available) with the same AOR and
      instance-id, but for different flow, if available.
   o  If the proxy receives a final response from a branch other than a
      408 (Request Timeout) or a 430 (Flow Failed) response, the proxy
      MUST NOT forward the same request to another target representing
      the same AOR and instance-id.  The targetted instance has already
      provided its response.

   The proxy uses normal forwarding rules looking at the next-hop target
   of the message and the value of any stored Path header field vector
   in the registration binding to decide how to forward the request and
   populate the Route header in the request.  If the proxy stored
   information about the flow over which it received the REGISTER for
   the binding, then the proxy MUST send the request over the same
   'logical flow' saved with the binding that is known to deliver data
   to the specific target UA instance.

      Typically this means that for TCP, the request is sent on the same
      TCP socket that received the REGISTER request. =20

   If a proxy or registrar receives information from the network that
   indicates that no future messages will be delivered on a specific
   flow, then the proxy MUST invalidate all the bindings in the target
   set that use that flow (regardless of AOR).  Examples of this are a
   TCP socket closing. Similarly, if a proxy closes a file descriptor,
it
   MUST invalidate all the bindings in the target set with flows that
   use that file descriptor.


Combining the multiple registration part of Outbound-06 together
with one of the mid-dialog failover drafts would be a bigger
excercise, so I skipped that for now ;-)

No, demuxing will be _impossible_ unless you parse the entire SIP 
message first.

I can't think of a single reason why one would not want to parse the 
complete SIP message first, can you please explain?

Hi Bruce,
    I think this is other way round, if sending on TCP fails then it is
recommended to try on UDP to keep the backward compatibility with RFC 2543. 
After timeout transaction MUST enter into terminated state and will not
retry by changing the protocol.

Manju

Hi,
There're many implementations when transportation on UDP fails or transation
timeout without response it will automatically try TCP connection. Is this
mandated in any RFCs? I think RFC3261 says if transaction timeouts it should
go to terminated state.
 
Is this implementation a violation to RFC3261?

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

My comments as follows (as you can see I have found nothing particularly
major in the document that requires correction). I have also sent some
NITs direct to the editor.

1)	This is really a NIT, but as it involves two documents I will
raise it on the list. We need to get the textual usages of the instance
id parameter consistent between draft-ietf-sip-gruu and
draft-ietf-sip-outbound. draft-ietf-sip-gruu seems to mainly call it a:

	"+sip.instance" parameter in the Contact header field
	"+sip.instance" Contact header field parameter

But I note at least instances of

	"sip.instance" media feature tag [14] as a UA characteristic [7]
	"+sip.instance" header field parameter

For exactly the same thing.

In draft-ietf-sip-outbound (-06 to appear) we have the following:

	"sip.instance" media feature tag as a UA characteristic
[RFC3840]
	the Contact header field as the "+sip.instance" Contact header
field parameter
	sip.instance media feature tag
	the +sip.instance Contact header field parameter
	an instance-id media feature tag=20
	+sip.instance media feature parameter is present in a Contact
header field value=20

Can Jonathan and Rohan work together to agree a common and consistent
usage.

2)	Again, a NIT, but the same thing. In both documents can we also
use "UA instance" rather than just "instance". Mostly consistent, but a
few exceptions. In outbound there is also a "SIP UA instance" where I
think the "SIP" is unnecessary.

Can Jonathan and Rohan work together to agree a common and consistent
usage.

3)	Again a NIT but the same thing.

"Instance ID" is used throughout in draft-ietf-sip-gruu.

In draft-ietf-sip-outbound we have the following definition:

   instance-id: This specification uses the word instance-id to refer to
      the value of the "sip.instance" media feature tag in the Contact
      header field.  This is a Uniform Resource Name (URN) that uniquely
      identifies this specific UA instance.

Followed by usage of that term throughout the document...except:

Title 4.1: "Instance ID Creation" and also within the contents of same
section.

Can Jonathan and Rohan work together to agree a common and consistent
usage.

4)	In section 4.1 we have:

   The contact URI MUST NOT be equivalent, based on the URI
   equality rules in RFC 3261, to the AOR in the To header field.

I was trying to work out why this was a normative requirement of the
GRUU document, given that it is followed by:

   If
   the contact URI is a GRUU, it MUST NOT be a GRUU for the AOR in the
   To header field.

Which is the normative statement within the scope of GRUU, is the first
statement really normative (with a MUST).

5)	Again a NIT, but can we please use RFC numbers in the
references. I know what you have done is allowed in the rules, but I get
fed up trying to remember that [14] is outbound. It is, isn't it?

6)	Section 5.1, current text is:

   Next, the registrar SHOULD create a new temporary GRUU for the AOR
   and instance ID with the characteristics described in Section 5.4.
   The temporary GRUU construction algorithm MUST have the following two
   properties:

   1.  The likelihood that the temporary GRUU is equal to another GRUU
       which the registrar has created MUST be vanishingly small.

   2.  Given a pair of GRUUs, it MUST be computationally infeasible to
       determine whether they were issued for the same AOR or instance
       ID or different AORs and instance IDs.

I would prefer to make this a registrar requirement by rephrasing the
text in the following manner. Also the MUSTs in 1) and 2) are not
necessary because they are part of the first MUST in the main text.

   Next, the registrar SHOULD create a new temporary GRUU for the AOR
   and instance ID with the characteristics described in Section 5.4.
   The registrar MUST apply a temporary GRUU construction algorithm=20
   with the following two properties:

   1.  The likelihood that the temporary GRUU is equal to another GRUU
       which the registrar has created is vanishingly small.

   2.  Given a pair of GRUUs, it is computationally infeasible to
       determine whether they were issued for the same AOR or instance
       ID or different AORs and instance IDs.

7)	Section 5.3:

   If, as a consequence of the expiration of the contact, a particular
   GRUU no longer has any registered contacts bound to it, and the GRUU
   is a temporary GRUU, the GRUU MUST be destroyed. =20

Change to:

   If, as a consequence of the expiration of the contact, a particular
   GRUU no longer has any registered contacts bound to it, and the GRUU
   is a temporary GRUU, the registrar MUST destroyed the GRUU.=20

I assume the above is a registrar requirement but the current text does
not seem particularly clear in that regard.

8)	Section 5.4:

   When a registrar creates a GRUU, it is required to maintain certain
   information associated with the GRUU, regardless of whether it is a
   public or temporary GRUU.  Every GRUU is associated with a single AOR
   and a single instance ID.  A registrar MUST be able to determine the
   instance ID and AOR when presented with a GRUU.

I think the "MUST" is in the wrong place here. We need a wording that is
more like:

	Every GRUU is associated with a single AOR and a single instance
ID.=20
	When a registrar creates a GRUU, a registrar MUST maintain
certain=20
	information associated with a GRUU,
	regardless of whether it is a public or temporary GRUU, such
that it=20
	can determine the instance ID and AOR when presented with a
GRUU."

9)	Section 5.4:

   There can be multiple GRUUs with the same instance ID and AOR.
   Indeed, this specification requires registrars to maintain many - one
   that is public, and several that are temporary.  However, if two
   GRUUs are associated with different AOR or different instance IDs or
   both, the GRUUs MUST be different based on URI equality comparison.
   A GRUU in a domain MUST NOT be equivalent, based on URI comparison,
   to any AOR in a domain except for the one associated with the GRUU.

Again I think we have lost the MUST requirement here. Surely the
requirement is that "A registrar MUST create GRUUs" that fulfil these
rules.

10)	Section 5.4:

   This specification does not mandate a particular mechanism for
   construction of the GRUU.  Several example approaches are given in
   Appendix A.  However, in addition to the properties described in
   Section 3.1, a GRUU constructed by a registrar MUST exhibit the
   following properties:

Again I think this needs to be rephrased as a registrar requirement.
Change to:

   This specification does not mandate a particular mechanism for
   construction of the GRUU.  Several example approaches are given in
   Appendix A.  However, in addition to the properties described in
   Section 3.1, a registrar MUST construct a GRUU such that it exhibits
the
   following properties:

11)	I note the following text in section 5.3:

   If, however, the GRUU was a public GRUU, the registrar SHOULD
   continue to treat the GRUU as valid.  Consequently, subsequent
   requests targeted to the GRUU, prior to re-registration of a contact
   to the GRUU, SHOULD return a 480.  In addition, since the GRUU
   remains valid, the rules in Section 5.1 will cause it to be retained
   when a contact with that instance ID is once again registered to the
   AOR.

And the following in section 6.1:

   If there are no registered contacts bound to the GRUU, the server
   MUST return a 480.  If there are more than one, the rules described
   in Section 7 of [14] for selecting a single registered contact apply.
   Any caller preferences in the request [19] SHOULD be processed
   against the contacts bound to the GRUU.

It appears to me that one requirement (6.1) is a more generic
requirement of the other, and as it is a MUST strength, the former one
is not valid at SHOULD strength.

12)	Section 7:

   The quoted strings for temp-gruu and pub-gruu MUST contain a SIP URI.
   However, they are encoded like all other quoted strings and can
   therefore contain quoted-pair escapes when represented this way.

I am not keen on writing MUSTs in grammer sections in this manner as I
am never sure if it is a sender or receiver requirement. It appears to
me that we have a requirement elsewhere in the document that says
(section 5.1):

   If the contact is not a SIP URI, the REGISTER request MUST be
   rejected with a 403.

Therefore I assume the only requirement here is one for the UA
generating GRUUs.

Keith

You have the same problem reading two sip messages in a row.

Many implementations have e a simple state machine that scans past  
the headers, find the content length, then scan past the body but no  
parsing other than that. I can point you at some code if you want.

Hi Ben,

per our face-to-face conversation in San Diego, you told me to stress 
the fact that clients need to have a way to know about the consent 
status of their operations. I have added the following sentence to the 
beginning of Section 5.2:

    Clients need a way to be informed about the status of the operations
    they requested.  The Pending Additions SIP event package [13], which
    SHOULD be supported by relays, is a way to provide clients with that
    information.

http://users.piuha.net/gonzalo/temp/draft-ietf-sip-consent-framework-01.txt

With this addition, all the WGLC comments should be addressed now. I 
will be submitting shortly.

Cheers,

Gonzalo

I would add a sentence describing the consequences of not having a  
way to get the status. Otherwise, it looks good to me.

Thanks!

Hi Ben,

> I would add a sentence describing the consequences of not having a 
> way to get the status. 

I have added the following sentence:

Clients need a way to be informed about the status of the operations
they requested. Otherwise, users may be waiting for an operation to
succeed when it has actually already failed.

> Otherwise, it looks good to me.

Good. I will submit the new revision then.

Thanks!

Gonzalo

I think it still needs to be a little more precise on the nature of  
the failure that can occur if you don't track the status. Something  
to the effect of :

"... In particular, if the target of the consent request was not  
reachable, the client needs to know to retry the request later."

Thanks!

Ben.

Hi Ben,

OK. The text now reads:

Clients need a way to be informed about the status of the operations
they requested. Otherwise, users may be waiting for an operation to
succeed when it has actually already failed. In particular, if the
target of the request for consent was not reachable and did not have
an associated store-and-forward server, the client needs to know to
retry the request later.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: C. Jennings, R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-outbound-06.txt
	Pages		: 41
	Date		: 2006-11-26
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to
   initiate TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User
   Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, many practical
   considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network
   Address Translators (NATs), prevent servers from connecting to User
   Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User
   Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be
   delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It
   also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open
   and specifies the usage of multiple connections.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-06.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-06.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Draft Minutes for SIP at IETF 67
Edited by Dean Willis

Based on notes by David Bryan, Spencer Dawkins, Jason Fischl, Philip  
Mathews, Chris Boulton, Richard Barnes, and Others.


Session 1: Thursday 1300-1500 Grand Ballroom C

Topic: Agenda Bash and Status
Discussion led by Chairs
Slides included in proceedings.

Agenda accepted as presented

Working group members asked to more thoroughly review the certs draft  
and consent framework.



Topic: Outbound
led by Rohan Mahy
Read: draft-ietf-sip-outbound-05
Slides included in proceedings.

Changes since last version reviewed.

Issue: Which response code to use for failures. No objection noted to  
proposed use of 430 Flow Failed.

Issue: Noted that there is no mention of rport in the draft. Author  
will add text explaining that UA must put rport parameter in Via and  
send from port it's prepared to receive on, and add informative  
reference to NAT scenarios document.

Issue: Verify outbound support on first or all hops? Discussion  
seemed to resolve on checking at registrar and first hop. Author will  
make appropriate changes to the document.

Issue: How to resolve possible mismatch in max-flows parameter  
between visited proxy and home proxy? Discussion of this question was  
inconclusive, with a general consensus to defer further discussion.

Issue: Detecting instance-ID binding rules. This relates to concerns  
raised by 3GPP. A side meeting with 3GPP was held, and the author  
thinks he understands the problem and will propose a solution in the  
next revision of the document. The expected approach is to relax the  
flow-token language somewhat to allow the specific use case proposed  
by 3GPP.




Topic: Domain Certs
led by Vijay Gurbani
Slides included in proceedings.
Read: draft-gurbani-sip-domain-certs-03

The use of embedded DNS names to indicate the purpose of a  
certificate was quite controversial and much discussion ensued. The  
security community holds that extended certificates may be a better  
solution.

Discussion of the document touched on whether the work is required  
and how it relates to other work. The discussion was inconclusive,  
and we expect to resolve it via list discussion and possibly a  
subject-specific conference call.


Topic: Connection Reuse
led by Vijay Gurbani 	
Slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-07


Issue: Since the impact of this work has essentially declined to  
halving the number of TLS between proxies not separated by NATs,  
should we continue to pursue the work? The opinion of the room was  
weighted about 5 to 1 against continuing the work. The chairs are  
tasked to raise this question on the mailing list.

Issue: The approach taken by the outbound mid-dialg draft may obviate  
some of the applicability for this draft. Discussion on this point  
was inconclusive, and it will be taken as a topic for an upcoming  
conference call.

Issue: The CP behavior in this document contradicts that in draft- 
ietf-sip-outbound.



Topic: SIPS Guidelines
led by Francois Audet
Slides included in proceeedings
Read: draft-audet-sip-sips-guidelines-04

Changes in document since last version reviewed.

Issue: 4 point  BCP list proposed on-list by Dean Willis. Noted that  
Item 1 is somewhat out of place, as it simply restates RFC 3261.  
Suggested that a BCP should perhaps explicitly state this as a  
"reminder". The room seemed to agree with points 2 and 3. Point 4  
remained controversial, with a general consensus emerging that it  
should be expressed at a "Should" strength along with discussion of  
the risk model and consequences.



Topic: GRUU and Supporting Drafts 	
Led by Jonathan Rosenberg 	
Slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-ietf-sip-gruu-11,draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-00

Change since last version reviewed.

Issue: GRUU subtype names. The room demonstrated a slight preference  
for the names used in -11 over known alternatives, but nobody seems  
particularly enamored with these names and the floor remains open to  
suggestions.

Discussion on ua-loose-route draft deferred to next session.


Session 2: Friday 0900-1130 Grand Ballroom C


Topic: UA-loose-route, continued from previous session.

Consensus noted that we do need some sort of solution for the general  
problem of delivery of URI parameters across contact-routing operations.

Issue: Concerns raised about backward compatibility. Noted that  
compliant P-CSCF should be OK.  Suggested that we have a design team  
revisit call-flows and analyze for backward compatibility issues.

Issue: Does GRUU normatively depend on this work? Resolved: GRUU does  
not reference this document. However, some participants feel it  
should, as the benefit of GRUU cannot be fully recognized in the  
absence of this specification.  The chairs asked for a hum, and the  
consensus of the room is that GRUU and ua-loose-route can proceed  
independently.

Question: Adopt this draft as baseline text for a WG effort, should  
the ADs approve the milestone? Consensus to adopt noted by chairs. To- 
do: Chairs to work with AD to set new milestone.

Topic: Location Conveyance
led by  James Polk and Brian Rosen
Slides included in proceedings
Read:  draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-05

Changes since last version reviewed.

The room discussed trust issues, location-by-value (needs  
geolocation), and the question of whether it is important to know  
which entity inserted a location. No changes to the document were  
noted as being required during this discussion.

The chairs polled for acceptability of current direction -- adding to  
a header. There were no objections noted to this direction.

Issue: Where to track the location error created by this draft?  
Proposed that we have separate registries for SIP and LOST.

Further discussion deferred to list and future conference call. To- 
do: Chairs to establish a conference call for discussion.


Topic: Connected Identity
led by John Elwell
Slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-ietf-sip-connected-identity-02

Current status reported as all issues fixed exception for rejection  
by RFC 4474 verifier.

Discussion concluded with a proposal to not make a statement about  
428 responses and policy, perhaps add an informational header into a  
mid-dialog request rather than rejecting outright.

Author will work with this approach and revise doc appropriately.


Topic: Identity Coexistence
led by Jonathan Rosenberg
slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-rosenberg-sip-identity-coexistence-00

Issue: How to deal with transit networks? This produced an extensive  
discussion. Proposed that logic in draft is inverted, and that we  
should perhaps be looking for Identity and falling back to PAID.

There seems to be some consensus that this work is valuable, although  
there is no consensus yet on the documented approach.

The author will revise the document for further discussion.


Topic: Outbound Discovery and Mid-Dialog Requests
led by: Jonathan Rosenberg
Slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-rosenberg-sip-outbound-discovery-mid-dialog-00

Issue: How to discover in the absence of DNS? There appears to be no  
consensus on whether this is a requirement.

Further discussion deferred to list.



Topic: Diagnostic Responses
led by Scott Lawrence
Slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics-03, draft-gurbani-sip- 
large-udp-response-00

Noted that ongoing NIT work proposes to deprecate provisional  
responses for non-INVITE transaction.

Proposed that SIP Redirection could be used to eliminate problem.

Author will bring discussion questions to the mailing list.


Topic: UA Profile Delivery
led by Dan Petrie
Slides included in proceedings
Read:  draft-ietf-sip-xcap-config-00 draft-petrie-sip-event-param-err-00

Changes since last version reviewed.

Noted that OMA has a dependency on XCAP change notifications. To:do;  
OMA liaison manager to open a dialog on this dependency.

Noted that PacketCable 2.0 uses this draft.



Topic: Route Constuction
Led by Jonathan Rosenberg
Slides included in proceedings
Read: draft-rosenberg-sip-route-construct-02

Noted that input from IMS vendors is needed to evaluate impact of  
this proposal. One speaker with some background in IMS opined that  
this technique should be useful with IMS.

Issue: Is Service-Route a reasonable way to provide the outbound  
proxy set? One speaker didn't think so, but no alternative  
suggestions were noted.

Further discussion deferred to mailing list.

Meeting adjourned several minutes past scheduled end of session.

I think the discussion of point 4 at the meeting may have missed the point.
Point 4 says basically that PSTN gateway termination can not use SIPS 
(to put it in the most pejorative fashion and then defend it.)

Point 1 is that everyone should use TLS.  Since 3261 already says 
this, saying it again is not a change.  It doesn't hurt to restate it.

The argument has been that SIPS (inside the IP cloud) means "MUST use 
TLS."  It has been clearly stated and agreed that it is not 
acceptable to use "or equivalent security."
Well, if "equivalent security is NOT okay in the IP domain, why is it 
okay for the PSTN?  Do they get  a free pass?  It seems to me that if 
we are going to tell secure providers of VoIP that they must reject 
SIPS requests (on the grounds that it isn't TLS, and if that was not 
required by the caller the caller should have just used SIP) then we 
owe it to ourselves and the users to make the same assertion about the PSTN.
Note, I am not claiming that the PSTN is less secure.  I am merely 
saying that if "equivalent security" is not acceptable, then it is 
not acceptable.

(I will refrain from rehashing the arguments on the marginal utility 
of SIPS anyway.)

Yours,
Joel M. Halpern

True, without parsing entire SIP message we would not know about the
existence of STUN packets.=20

The reason behind posting this question is coming more from
implementation point of view. Suppose if some implementations receive
the messages from TCP sockets in one thread and process them in other
thread contexts and if it is the responsibility of receiving thread to
demux the packets and give it to individual threads, then it would be a
problem (If the receiving thread gives the entire second read buffer to
SIP processing thread, unless there is a way to get back the remaining
buffer from SIP thread, the receive thread can not handover the STUN
packet to STUN processing thread)

When the draft mentioned the demuxing based on the first octet in case
of TCP was a strightforward solution, I thought there might be already a
simple solution for the scenario described above.

One solution I thought of was looking for STUN magic cokkie (combined
with Message Type or finger print) in each an every received packet from
the socket and distribute the packets to individual processing threads.
But then the magic cokkie part could have been split across multiple TCP
reads, so this solution won't work.

Srikanth=20

No, demuxing will be _impossible_ unless you parse the entire SIP
message first.

I can't think of a single reason why one would not want to parse the
complete SIP message first, can you please explain?

Hi Rohan!

I have a question regarding sending with TLS in section 4.3:

> 4.3  Sending Requests
> 
>    When a UA is about to send a request, it first performs normal
>    processing to select the next hop URI.  The UA can use a variety of
>    techniques to compute the route set and accordingly the next hop URI.
>    Discussion of these techniques is outside the scope of this document
>    but could include mechanisms specified in RFC 3608 [RFC3608] (Service
>    Route) and [I-D.rosenberg-sip-route-construct].
> 
>    The UA performs normal DNS resolution on the next hop URI (as
>    described in RFC 3263 [RFC3263]) to find a protocol, IP address, and
>    port.  For non-TLS protocols, if the UA has an existing flow to this
>    IP address, and port with the correct protocol, then the UA MUST use
>    the existing connection.  For TLS protocols, there MUST also be a
>    match between the host production in the next hop and one of the URIs
>    contained in the subjectAltName in the peer certificate.  If the UA
>    cannot use one of the existing flows, then it SHOULD form a new flow
>    by sending a datagram or opening a new connection to the next hop, as
>    appropriate for the transport protocol.

The UA is only allowed to reuse a TLS connection, if the host production 
of the next hop is also present in the subjectAltName of the peer's 
certificate. Otherwise it should open a new TLS connection to the next hop.

But as this new connection is sent to the same remote socket, it is very 
likely that the peer's certificate in the new TLS connection is the same 
as in the existing connection, unless the client and server are capable 
of the "Server Name Indication" TLS extension. Thus, what about 
suggesting this TLS extension?

regards
klaus

[JRE] I recall there was some mention of an informational header, but it was
not clear to me exactly what the intention was and whether it was intended
for use instead of an outright rejection. I am about to issue a further
revision that takes account of the consensus at the meeting but without
introducing any new header field. If anybody has a concrete proposal for
such a header field, please make it known as soon as possible.

   From: "Vavilapalli Srikanth-A19563" <srikanthv@motorola.com>

   The reason behind posting this question is coming more from
   implementation point of view. Suppose if some implementations receive
   the messages from TCP sockets in one thread and process them in other
   thread contexts and if it is the responsibility of receiving thread to
   demux the packets and give it to individual threads, then it would be a
   problem (If the receiving thread gives the entire second read buffer to
   SIP processing thread, unless there is a way to get back the remaining
   buffer from SIP thread, the receive thread can not handover the STUN
   packet to STUN processing thread)

The receiving thread must assemble the read buffers into a byte
stream, then parse the byte stream to find the message boundaries, and
copy the messages it finds into different buffers, and pass those
buffers to the processing thread.

It is a *very* general rule that when reading input from TCP, the
"read buffer" boundaries have no correspondance to *any* feature of
the data in the input stream.  The code that reads the TCP socket must
assemble the read buffers into a continuous input stream and parse
them in the way that is appropriate for the data.

You would be amused at the number of programs that die if you feed
them input on a TCP connection with one byte per TCP packet, because
the TCP stack gives one byte read buffers to the reader process, and
the reader process can't cope with that.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-consent-framework-01.txt
	Pages		: 27
	Date		: 2006-11-27
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across
   many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant
   messaging, and presence.  In its current form, it allows session
   invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered
   from one party to another without requiring explicit consent of the
   recipient.  Without such consent, it is possible for SIP to be used
   for malicious purposes, including amplification, and DoS (Denial of
   Service) attacks.  This document identifies a framework for consent-
   based communications in SIP.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

I think your description of Point 4 is missing a few things.

I think the group agreed that "SIPS termination SHOULD be used for all
derived
connections" when possible.

The key point was that there was a concensus that using SIPS to a PSTN
gateway
was legal. The rationale what that the scope of this document stops at
SIP boundaries.

Specifically, in the SIP "cloud", implementations SHOULD use SIPS for
derived=20
connections. An example of where this is is important is a B2BUA.

And then we would put some wording that what happens outside the SIP
network is out
of scope of this document. Some other networks (e.g., H.323) may have
some equivalent
security mechanism.

Again, the key point was allowing for SIPS to PSTN gateways.

I don't recall any such consensus.

The above seems to be a rehash of the prior on-list arguments made in 
support of this conclusion.

IMO if the request has reached a UAS that is properly authenticated as 
the intended recipient of the request, then the contract implied by SIPS 
has been fulfilled, and what happens after that is out of scope. Whether 
that UAS happens to be a gateway is irrelevant as long as it has the 
proper credentials for the target address.

I don't remember what the consensus was but I'm seem to recall making  
a similar argument to Paul. Perhaps someone could listen to the audio  
recordings of this and try and straight it out. I would be very  
surprised if we had consensus that if one side of a IP to IP gateway  
(such as protocol translator) was doing sips that the other side also  
had to do sips.

Subject: RE: [Sip] automatically switches to TCP


Hi Manju,
1. Is this documented somewhere?  
    About switching of protocol, it is documented in RFC 3261 in sec 18.1.1.
 
"If an element sends a request over TCP because of these message size
constraints, and that request would have otherwise been sent over
UDP, if the attempt to establish the connection generates either an
ICMP Protocol Not Supported, or results in a TCP reset, the element
SHOULD retry the request, using UDP. This is only to provide
backwards compatibility with RFC 2543 compliant implementations that
do not support TCP. It is anticipated that this behavior will be
deprecated in a future revision of this specification. " 
 
    About transaction moving to terminated state, check in the transaction
part of RFC 3261.
 
2. We had a stack which sends messages over UDP as mandated by UA, if UDP
failure or transaction timeout(e.g. after 7 retrys of INVITE) it switches to
TCP instead of going into terminated state -- this sounds violate your
"MUST"?
    I am not sure why this behaviour is implemented; however,  I think this
is violation of standard.
 
Thanks,
Bruce

Hi Bruce,
    I think this is other way round, if sending on TCP fails then it is
recommended to try on UDP to keep the backward compatibility with RFC 2543. 
After timeout transaction MUST enter into terminated state and will not
retry by changing the protocol.

Manju

Hi,
There're many implementations when transportation on UDP fails or transation
timeout without response it will automatically try TCP connection. Is this
mandated in any RFCs? I think RFC3261 says if transaction timeouts it should
go to terminated state.
 
Is this implementation a violation to RFC3261?
 
Thanks,
Bruce

Hi

Outbound (-06) "5.2  Generating Flow Tokens" says

   "A proxy can use any algorithm
    it wants as long as the flow token is unique to a flow, the flow can
    be recovered from the token, and the token can not be modified by
    attackers."

and then goes on explaining two stateless algorithms that both, if I 
understand them correctly, would generate a static flow token for a 
given flow (static for as long as the proxy is running).

Can you please explain what attack scenarios this is meant to avoid?

Algorithm #1 MUST NOT be used if SIPS isn't being used between the edge 
proxy and the registrar, but I don't really see which attacks would be 
possible if algorithm #1 was used without SIPS, that would not also be 
possible with algorithm #2 without SIPS.

Perhaps the problem is that I don't interpret "can not be modified by 
attackers" correctly - please explain what you mean by that too =).

/Fredrik

The document referred to defines=20

-	'sigcomp-id' Via header field parameter
-	'sigcomp-id' SIP URI parameter

This was previously brought to the attention of the SIP list, but just
to be formal, we would like to give a two week WGLC session in the SIP
WG in parallel to the one that will occur in the ROHC working group.

Please therefore review and comment on the current version of this
document by Tuesday 12th December 2006, in particular to the parts that
define these parameters. Please send your comments to the IETF ROHC list
rather than to the IETF SIP list.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Robust Header Compression Working Group
of the IETF.

	Title		: Applying Signaling Compression (SigComp) to
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: Z. Liu, et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-rohc-sigcomp-sip-04.txt
	Pages		: 20
	Date		: 2006-11-27

This document describes some specifics that apply when Signaling
   Compression (SigComp) is applied to the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP), such as default minimum values of SigComp parameters,
   compartment and state management, and a few issues on SigComp over
   TCP.  Any implementation of SigComp for use with SIP must conform to
   this document, in addition to SigComp and support of the SIP and
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) static dictionary.

So if the CSCF is acting as a B2BUA (which it can sometimes do) it's  
OK to use IPSEC instead of TLS on hops behind that CSCF, even though  
a SIPS: URI was used to initiate the request?

The answer to that depends on the purpose of the B2BUA. My SIPS 
connection is with it. What is appropriate for it to do is up to it to 
decide. If I don't trust it to decide then I shouldn't call it.

In some cases (e.g. the fabled "transparent" B2BUA) it may be that the 
only thing that makes sense on the other side is SIPS again. In other 
cases UDP may be reasonable.

Let's try to write up something for the document.
I am pretty sure that I remember that in essence, what we
decided was that:
1) Anything outside SIP network is out-of-scope
2) B2BUA SHOULD preserve SIPS on both sides. (It was also said that
there ain't nothing we
   can do to enforce it of course).

Here is a strawman:

   3.1.  Scope of SIPS

   It is outside of the scope of this document to specify what happens
   when a SIPS URI defines a UAS that "maps" outside of the SIP network.
   For example, to other networks such as the PSTN or an H.323 network.
   These networks have their own standards on what is appropriate
   security levels.

   Derived connections in SIP however should use SIPS end-to-end, even
   accross distinct SIP networks.  For example, If a Back-to-Back-User-
   Agent (B2BUA) receives a request destined to a SIPS Request-URI and
   it forwards it, it should use a SIPS Request-URI on the outgoing
   connection as well.  This could happen for example when the B2BUA is
   Session Border Controller sitting between two SIP networks.  It could
   also happen in an Application Server or with SIP third-party call
   control [RFC3725].

I think that the second point is arguable, and depends on exactly what
function the B2BUA is performing.  And I also think that this is what
Paul Kyzivat was describing when he wrote:

# IMO if the request has reached a UAS that is properly authenticated as

# the intended recipient of the request, then the contract implied by
SIPS=20
# has been fulfilled, and what happens after that is out of scope.

If I send a request to sips:alice@example.com, which arrives at a B2BUA
and is subsequently retargeted to sip:alice@alicepc.example.com, then I
think the change from sips to sip is fair - I wanted to reach the AoR
(sips:alice@example.com) using sips, which I have done.

If, on the other hand, I send a request to
sips:alice@alicepc.example.com, which happens to transit a B2BUA
en-route, then changing from sips to sip is not fair - I have not
reached my target in the manner that I have requested.

The distinction is, of course, that in the first case, the B2BUA was the
target of my request, but in the second it was merely a transit point.
Requiring SIPS to SIPS for the latter is an excellent move, but I am not
convinced about requiring it for the former.

Regards,

Michael Procter

I think I am ok with SHOULD for B2BUAs, but I still think it is hard to 
be specific because of the wide variety of things that B2BUAs can do.

Consider a different kind of B2BUA - a conference focus. If it allows 
connections via SIPS, should it require all connections to be SIPS? 
While that might be a policy for some conferences, I don't think it is 
the only reasonable policy.

Hello,
   
  Consider the following situation.
   
              Adam wants to call Bob, lets say that Bob is registered at three locations, that is, at home, at head office and at his branch office. Hence, when Adam makes a call, INVITE request is forked by the proxy and it reaches all the three destinations. Hence, three 200 OK SIP response will be sent back to Adam. 
   
              Consider the situation, when Bobs friends answer the call at all the three locations at the same time, what will happen? Either three media channel will be established between them or which two will be discarded.
   
              Can anyone please clear this?
   
  With regards
  Raj.

While all three locations may ring at once, its unlikely that all three 
with answer at exactly the same time. As long as one answers first be a 
second of so, the proxy will cancel the others and they won't send a 200 
response.

Its only when multiple phones are answered in the small time window 
where they can't be canceled that you get multiple 200 replies. If that 
happens, its up to Adam's UA to decide what to do. While it *could* 
conference them all together, a common strategy is simply to send a BYE 
to all except the first.

Agreed, that's why it's a should, and that's why that section is
short...

Are we OK with the wording?

And remember: concrete proposals...

I was thinking of bringing this up. The trick is determining if the 
B2BUA is the target of the request or not. This isn't an easy question 
to answer based on info in 3261.

Ignoring for now the new proposal for loose routing for UAs, I have been 
thinking that a server should determine if it is the UAS for a request 
by first removing any Route headers that refer to it. After that, it 
should only act as a UAS if there are no Route headers and the R-URI 
identifies the server. If there are Route headers that don't refer to 
it, or the R-URI doesn't refer to it, then it can either act as a 
proxy/redirect server, or else it can simply return an error.

BUT I find nothing saying to do any of that. In 8.2 of 3261 there is no 
mention of checking either Route headers or the R-URI. I'm not sure if 
this is intended, or is an oversight.

(Of course with loose routing for UAs this would change. In that case, I 
guess all leading Route headers referring to the server should be 
removed. If the last of these had ";lr" then the R-URI need not 
reference the server and instead identifies the intended callee. If 
there were no Route headers removed, or if the last one didn't have 
";lr", then validation should be the old way.)

If one then introduces B2BUAs into this picture, you need a somewhat 
modified set of rules. In a case that would otherwise require acting as 
a proxy, it might be permissible to act as a "transit B2BUA", 
terminating the incoming request but generating another on the other 
side, preserving the R-URI and the remainder of the Route.

With such a set of rules, I think it would make sense that SIPS be 
preserved across such a "transit B2BUA". Conversely, if the request 
terminates on the B2BUA without any further routing specified, but the 
B2BUA chooses to route it on anyway, then preservation of SIPS would be 
at the discretion of the B2BUA.

I just posted some further thoughts on this. I think they are 
interesting, but probably beyond the scope of this document. (It may be 
getting to the point where we actually need another document to discuss 
kinds of B2BUAs and expected behaviors for them. But I wouldn't want to 
hold this document up for that.)

Here is a slight modification to your proposal, for consideration:

I am not sure what the above means. What is a "derived connection"? I 
think that part could simply be omitted without loss, though I would not 
object to something a little clearer.

Putting that all together it comes out as:

     3.1.  Scope of SIPS

     It is outside of the scope of this document to specify what
     happens when a SIPS URI identifies a UAS that "maps" outside
     of the SIP network.

     For example, to other networks such as the PSTN or an H.323 network.
     These networks have their own standards on what is appropriate
     security levels.

     If a Back-to-Back-User-Agent (B2BUA) receives a request
     destined to a SIPS Request-URI that does not identify itself
     and it forwards it on towards that Request-URI, it SHOULD use
     a SIPS Request-URI on the outgoing connection as well.  This
     could happen for example when the B2BUA is a Session Border
     Controller sitting between two SIP networks.  It could also
     happen in an Application Server or with SIP third-party call
     control [RFC3725].

There appeared to be some confusion regarding the proposed minutes 
(specifically discussion on the 4th Point of Dean's Trial Balloon) and 
the concensus on SIPS and the PSTN.
Therefore, I went back to the audio stream and collected the comments 
made regarding the points of Dean's proposal.

One point of note is that no one present at the meeting appeared to 
supported the idea that a SIPS call fail when it hits a PSTN gateway.

The audio recording can be obtained at:
http://limestone.uoregon.edu/ftp/pub/videolab/media/ietf67/ietf67ch8-thu-noon.mp3 
<http://limestone.uoregon.edu/ftp/pub/videolab/media/ietf67/ietf67ch8-thu-noon.mp3> 


To aid anyone else who wants to listen to the audio stream, the number 
next to each comment is the time (relative to the start of the audio 
stream, represented as Hours:Minutes:Seconds) that the comment was made. 
(I apologize to the speakers whose names I didn't catch and of course 
for any transcription errors in the following.)

[2:41:00] Francois begins his explanation of the four points of Dean's 
Trail Balloon Proposal.

[2:44:40] Question from Jabber Channel: Does Point 2 mean all hops are TLS?
              Answer: Yes

[2:45:30] Explanation of why the functionality provided by SIPS is 
important. [Not directly related to Point 4]

[2:47:45] Eric Burger says that we should remove Point 4. "Take the 
whole thing out [referring to Point 4] ... Unless it's really end-to-end 
it's like a non-solvable problem. 'It' being not just to a PSTN gateway, 
but to another IP gateway or whatever. If it is to a PSTN gateway that 
does terminate to a PSTN phone then actually the SIPS thing, the 
promise, was kept and if it's a gateway to another SIP thing then it is 
not kept ... Just don't mention PSTN termination"

[2:48:40] Question to Eric: "What about other protocols that you might 
gateway to?"
              Eric's Answer: "It's a non-solvable problem." Therefore, 
delete bullet 4.

[2:48:50] Paul Kyzivat begins, "I've said all I want to say about 4, I'm 
not going to say anymore." He then argues against bullet 1 being a 
SHOULD. "I just don't believe that most of the time it's going to be 
done. And if it isn't going to be done most of the time then putting the 
SHOULD in is just holding out a false promise to people."

[2:49:45] Cullen Jennings comments on Points 1 and 4. On Point 1 he says 
"I think that we need to very clearly differentiate between what you to 
implement and what you need to use. As a general rule of thumb, on lots 
of our things here, we've tried to get people to implement security but 
not say that people necessarily have to use security." On Point 4 he 
says "I have a clear phrasing of what the commitment is, which is you're 
going to use TLS all the way to the UA. That's what I think it should 
be. Now my UA happens to be a speaker phone and I'm sitting in this room 
right now and there's a hundred people. I mean SIPS doesn't mean 
anything about what's going to happen on the other side of that speaker 
phone. I don't think it means anything about what's going to happen on 
the other side of that gateway. I don't think it means anything about 
what's going to happen on the other side of that protocol translator. 
Hopefully the protocol translater would do reasonable things, but it is 
impossible for us to specify beyond that point."

[2:51:00] Question for Cullen: "Would you say that it's a best current 
practice for an SBC to terminate a SIPS connection and generate a SIP 
connection on the other side?"

[2:51:15] Cullen replies: "I think that one of the most useful features 
that an SBC vender could offer today would be the one on the edge of an 
enterprise that could take unsecure phone calls from venders that hadn't 
managed to implement all of this stuff inside the enterprise and secure 
it as it crossed the internet. I think that's a great thing for people 
to go build. Needless to say the same thing needs to happen on incoming 
calls ... It doesn't matter what we say in these specifications though. 
Short of us breaking the PSTN there's no way to solve this ... We should 
not pretend that SIPS means anything beyond the UA."

[2:52:15] New speaker <didn't catch name> comments on Points 1 and 4. On 
Point 1 he observes that in IMS you end up using SIPS over an IPSEC 
connection. Therefore, you're encrypting the signalling twice, once with 
TLS and once with IPSEC.  He raises the question: Is it good for us to 
do that? On Point 4, he says  that we cannot go into the PSTN and we 
should not go beyond the IP side gaurantees that SIPS can provide.

[2:53:05] New speaker reminds everyone that it is Dean and not Francois 
that is to the source of this controversy.
              "The one thing that I would say about 4 is for certain 
forms of protocol interworking where we're dealing with something that's 
going from IP to IP, basically from one IP based protocol to another 
one, I wouldn't see the harm in having something that was a BCP have 
like a SHOULD level thing saying if there is a comparable sort of  
mechanism in that protocol than you should try to invoke it ... I think 
you would certainly want to fail it if that capability was available in 
the other protocol but not invokable ... I wouldn't be opposed to there 
being some language like that. For something like PSTN which is so 
dissimilar to the way that SIP operates, I don't think it's reasonable 
to expect that any of this carries over ... So, no number 1, please and 
a softer 4."

[2:54:30] New speaker agrees with previous speaker. "That's exactly the 
same opinion that I had for PSTN and for similar networks."

[2:54:45] New speaker points out that Brian Rosen (who is not present) 
is adamant that SIPS calls should fail if they reach a PSTN gateway.

[2:54:55] Hadriel Kaplan agrees that Point 1 shouldn't be a SHOULD, "You 
can change it from a SHOULD to a MIGHT". He then comments on Point 4, 
"There's no question that SIPS is SIPS, it's part of SIP, not H.323, not 
PSTN, SS7, whatever. When you've reached the UAS, you've reached the 
UAS. You want to write a BCP, go right ahead, but the people who don't 
want to keep it SIPS or use SIPS or whatever will just ignore the BCP. 
For an SBC in particular ... As far as I know most of the SBC's that do 
support SIPS will obviously try to keep it SIPS on the other side of 
themselves. And, guess what, if the operator doesn't want them to, or 
says 'no you don't have to and you can use SIP', then they will do that 
because that's the whole concept of an SBC is that the operator decides 
... I don't know the point of a BCP." He then goes on and argues that 
SIPS should not be deprecated.

[2:56:45] Dean Willis addresses Hadriel's point on the need for a BCP. 
His analogy is that a BCP on operational recommendations for SIPS is 
analogous to a BCP on operating email systems that says 'don't be an 
open email relay'.

[2:57:30] Hadriel says he understands but "It just seemed to me to be 
kind of funny, like writing a BCP that says 'Be Good'. The guys who 
don't won't to be good, won't be. There's no point in telling them to be 
good."

[2:57:45] Dean says "It's more on the order of 'if you don't lock your 
doors, people can wander in through your doors'."

[2:57:50] Hadriel says "Oh, you think that people might do it accidently 
... You think they might just misconfigure ... I'm with you."

[2:58:30] Jon Elwell comments on Point 4 "I agree with the majority, I 
think, that it has to stop at the UAS, whether that's a SIP gateway or a 
phone or a speaker phone or whatever. I'm a little bit concerned about 
the B2BUA case, particularly what you mentioned Dean. If a B2BUA SBC 
upgrades a SIP request to SIPS then I guess no harm is done. The other 
way around though is a bit worse ... We don't normally legislate for 
B2BUA's, that's the problem, so I don't know how we deal with this, but 
I'm a little bit uneasy about it."

[2:59:20] Francois says, "I think the wording that Jon Peterson had 
actually applies here. It's a similar network. It's kind of two 
back-to-back SIP networks. It seems like a BCP-type thing."

[2:59:30] Keith says, "My assumption of the point of this conversation 
is that basically we now reflect the pros and cons in the document."

[2:59:45] Francois indicates that he has a sense from the room of what 
we heard. "[Point] 1 I think is some level of support but not that much. 
[Point] 4 I think we have a pretty good concesus except for one person 
who's not here. [Point] 3 is obvious, and [Point] 2 I think is ... 
implicitly I think that people like the idea of deprecating the last hop 
but we didn't really have a vote or anything on that."

[3:00:20] Dean says "I think we have concensus on pretty much everything 
except for the fine-print writing of 4, and I think there's a fairly 
strong sense that number 1 is out of place and it just echos what's 
already in 3261. So I think we can reduce number 4 to a should level and 
explain the issues and do away with number 1 and I think everyone 
besides Brian Rosen will be happy."

Thanks Matt. That is very useful.

PS: The name you didn't catch in there was John Peterson.

In light of the transcript, are people OK with the current wording, as
ammended by Paul Kyzivat? At least as a starting point point for=20

I must say I'm a bit worried about 'should'. I think Dean raised this 
point; since tons of "proxies" todays are also b2bua's in some sense 
(that is, they do things a pure proxy cannot), this may very well reduce 
the overall effectiveness of sips to just SHOULD use TLS. That seems 
ever looser than what we have today.

I'd rather not try to define what constitutes a b2bua that can downgrade 
sips, and what kind of b2bua cannot. Instead, it seems easier to simply 
state that if you are not the target of the sips URI, and you have a SIP 
next-hop, you MUST use TLS on that hop.

What about this:


3.1.  Scope of SIPS

   It is outside of the scope of this document to specify what happens
   when a SIPS URI identifies a UAS that "maps" outside of the SIP
   network.  For example, to other networks such as the PSTN or an H.323
   network.  These networks have their own standards on what is
   appropriate security level
  =20
   If a B2BUA is used in lieu of a proxy (as is common in practical
deployment),=20
   if it receives a request destined to a SIPS Request-URI that does not
identify itself=20
   and it forwards it on towards that Request-URI, it must use a=20
   SIPS Request-URI on the outgoing connection as well. =20

Yeah, except that I've been instructed by the Chairs that this document
is 'informational' only.

I assume that it means that I can't make normative statements of any
kind. Is this true?

IMHO, after SIPS we are committing one more mistake. After knowing SIPS
is completely broken, we are attempting to justify the need on the
charter. I am failing to see the value of any these documents. Rather go
to IESG directly and get this milestone removed from the charter. All
this is merely wastage of cycles. BTW, I don't want to open the complete
ranting mode now.

Thx
Samir

I see the value of a document clarifying RFC3261 and documenting best 
practices around SIPS. However, I also think there are limits to what a 
draft can hope to achieve. Saying that a B2BUA MUST do this and that will 
not magically change the way the world is evolving. A B2BUA that forwards 
SIPS to SIP can still interoperate, it may be breaking the implicit 
assumptions / expectations that (some of) the standards people have/had in 
mind while specifying the SIP protocol, but to the average consumer that 
won't make much difference. So in short: write down what may happen when 
using SIPS, recommend what should ideally happen, and move on.

Regards,
Jeroen

Rohan is making a valid point here and I believe in Outbound there
is still room for change to cater for CRLF keepalives as an option
to STUN keepalives over TCP.

I am calling the WG to look back on the keepalive decision made
earlier for TCP and proposing that Outbound should also cover=20
CRLF keepalive option.

Reasons for this proposal:

>this would read "Make TCP and TLS work in the Internet".

I agree with the intents of this community. However this is not what
the current Outbound provides. Outbound specifies two options for
keepalives for reliable connections: TCP keepalive and STUN.

These options were agreed in IETF 65, a cite from the minutes:
       =20
Proposal:=20
   Do STUN for TCP and UDP=20
   Do CRLF for TCP and STUN for UDP=20
   TCP KeepAlive if supported, 1 or 2 otherwise=20

Resolutions: =20
   OS TCP KeepAlive should be used if the client supports it.=20
   Need something more because OS TCP KeepAlive is not supported in
every
   client OS.=20
   Consensus to use STUN for UDP=20
   Consensus to use STUN for TCP, with use of OS TCP keep alive above. =20

In that meeting the basic assumption was that every Outbound
compliant client should implement both UDP and TCP even if that
is not explicitely mentioned in the draft. However latest -06
version now makes that debatable by stating:

   Use of outbound with UDP flows typically prevents messages larger
   than 1300 bytes from being delivered using TCP as described in
   Section 18.1.1 RFC 3261.  Use of outbound in conjunction with UDP
   flows in environments where requests are expected to be larger than
   this size is therefore NOT RECOMMENDED.

In practice this seems to justify implementing "TCP only" UAs
what comes to the Outbound support. In that case the basic assumption
with STUN keepalive (implement it for TCP as it is anyway needed for
UDP as well) would become obsolete. For implementations which can
not use TCP keepalive, CRLF would obviously provide a great benefit
without significant increase of complexity to Outbound.


P.S. Last week I made a proposal for "stripped Outbound" without
UDP, STUN keepalives and multiple registrations. As that proposal
did not receive any comments, I decided to propose this minimal
addition to Outbound as an alternative that might be a bit easier
to accept but still achieve some of the benefits.

Regards,

Erkki

What is the utility of SIPS ? I have posted so many times the limitation
of SIPS.
Tell me what part you like. Double entries. Upgrade / dowgrade etc.
retargeting. What will you do for telURI. It's a king with underwar only
as Paul said in the frustration earlier.

Thx

Added to this, we have S/MIME mentioned at so many places. But nobody is
using it.
I think similar will be for SIPS. Also as per the process, refer CMM/SEI
KPA's there is constant process improvement. If IETF current process
doesn't allow to remove the milestone, then update the process. It's
causing more of a pain. Who will be using SIPS ?

Should we voting on the mailing list for the need of the this document ?
I am frustrated the way this group behaves. It wanted to get rid of
RUNNING CODE well established truth, but for this idiotic document, you
don't want to agree. It has been two meetings. Ideally it should have
been gone in the Montreal itself, if people allowed me to speak. At that
time where was your purist mindset, which you were arguing for the PING.

(As WG chair)

If you wish the IETF rules allow you to do this.

To make very clear the position:

If you wish to achieve what you want, which is deprecation of various
requirements in RFC 3261, then you have already been asked to provide
the appropriate discussion material to this internet-draft. Part of the
output of the internet-draft is to make recommendations on improvement,
which can include deprecation. But we want to see the WG making an
informed decision, based on a clear understanding of what is the impact
on existing implementations, why the existing mechanism causes damage in
the community, and so on.

The scope of the internet-draft is made very clear in the slides
(http://www3.ietf.org/proceedings/06nov/slides/sip-2.pdf) - see slide 2.

Regards

Keith

Let me ask a question straigtaway who would like to use SIPS ?

There was no voting/hum was done on the need of this doc in the meeting.
I questioned in the meeting the need of the doc. On which Dean replied
that we have similar for email etc. email is used, I can agree. But we
know that this will not be used. Do you want to spend cycles on
documenting/discussing for just gaguing the implementor's pain versus
the complete brokenness of SIPS.=20

Tell me where it is useful? It cannot be even used in the protected
network, where event watchers etc are involved.

If you are one of the implementers, then do the proper analysis before
implementing.

Thx
Samir

Hello,
   
                Recently I read from an article that signalling path of SIP is different from the path of media. When two end points want to communicate using SIP, the signalling takes place according to the operation of SIP, but once the signalling is over and when the media channel has to be established, which protocol is used to find the optimal media path?
   
               Moreover, when the session has to be terminated, SIP enabled end point has to send the BYE request, in this case, whether it takes the same path of INVITE request(which initiated the session) or  a different one. I am considering the stateless proxies to be in the network.
   
  with regards
  Raj.

Personally, I think that the initial qualifying phrase of the last
paragraph is potentially ambiguous:

    If a B2BUA is used in lieu of a proxy (as is common in practical
    deployment), if it receives...

Could this be removed and an explanatory sentence appended to the
paragraph to make it read more like:

    If a B2BUA (Back to Back User Agent) receives a request destined
    to a SIPS Request-URI that does not identify itself
    and it forwards it on towards that Request-URI, it must use a
    SIPS Request-URI on the outgoing connection as well.  This can
    occur when a B2BUA is used in lieu of a proxy (as is common in
    practical deployments).

As to whether 'must' should be MUST or must or SHOULD or should, I'll
leave that to you!

Regards,

Michael

Hello to all,
   
                I read an article about Skype and it was stated that it takes 2 to 3 seconds for session establishment. Can anyone tell me how long will it take for SIP for session establishment?

In general the call establishment takes the typical round trip duration
between the UserAgents.  Typically the roundtrip could be around 500 msec.

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Sip] Signalling time - regarding

 

Hello to all,

 

              I read an article about Skype and it was stated that it takes
2 to 3 seconds for session establishment. Can anyone tell me how long will
it take for SIP for session establishment?

 

with regards

Raj

This seems very much at cross purposes with Francois' draft and would
just add to the confusion, IMO. What would be better is for Francois' draft
to add that option along with the documentation (which in itself is like
proving a negative, but I digress) and then have the working group just
choose which section of the draft to delete, or insert what the ultimate
choice was or something like that. I think that documenting why SIPS
was or wasn't deprecated is every bit as important as clarifying the
mistakes that were made initially.

You may want to see some IETF example call flows.

=20

In addition to RFC 3261, please refer to RFC 3665 and other BCPs on SIP.

=20

To answer the question, the media could be RTP based.  The media path =
are
between the two UAs.

=20

The call signaling could be established where multiple SIP servers could =
be
involved.  If the SIP servers needs to be in the signaling path for the
duration of the call, then the Servers do Record-Route.  So, a BYE or =
any
other requests will visit the SIP servers.  If the SIP servers do not =
wish
to be in the path for subsequent requests, it will not record-route.

Subject: [Sip] Signalling and media path of SIP

=20

Hello,

=20

              Recently I read from an article that signalling path of =
SIP is
different from the path of media. When two end points want to =
communicate
using SIP, the signalling takes place according to the operation of SIP, =
but
once the signalling is over and when the media channel has to be
established, which protocol is used to find the optimal media path?

=20

             Moreover, when the session has to be terminated, SIP =
enabled
end point has to send the BYE request, in this case, whether it takes =
the
same path of INVITE request(which initiated the session) or  a different
one. I am considering the stateless proxies to be in the network.

=20

with regards

Raj.

Hi Erkki,

Clearly you are suggesting that we make CRLF mandatory to implement
for TCP.  There would be no longer any need to do STUN over TCP and
therefore no need implement code to deal with stream-based demuxing.
  The text about sigcomp over TCP and STUN over TLS over TCP could
also go away.

To clarify are you suggesting that an edge proxy can implement
outbound without support for UDP flow tokens, without support for STUN
keepalives over UDP, both, or neither?

thanks,
-rohan

Hi all,

After re-reading the transcript (especially the points made by Cullen
Jennings, Eric Burger and
Jon Peterson), and further confirmed by the emailing list discussion, I
believe that we should=20
not discuss B2BUA at all and limit it it what happens in the SIP
network.

This is what I am now proposing.

3.1.  Scope of SIPS

   SIPS means that the SIP resource designated by the target SIPS
   URI be contacted securily, using TLS, on each SIP hop (last-hop
exception=20
   nothwistanding). It is outside of the scope of this document to
specify=20
   what happens when a SIPS URI identifies a UAS resource that "maps"
outside
   of the SIP network, for example, to other networks such as the PSTN.

Hi Mike,

   Francois personally asked me to make my case separately in another
draft. He wanted in his draft the SIPS the way it is etc.

Therefore I don't see any value in it at all, as it will not cover why
the SIPS is bad for health etc. Why don't we cover this in the next
version cipher-suite draft. It will state that it fixes the open holes
of SIPS also with the proxy-require of cipher-suite.

Thx
Samir =20

One possibility is to consider this doc as a BCP, not Info, and BCP  
can quite reasonably use 2119 language. This is an AD call.

It might also be reasonable to use 2119 language in an Informational  
document. We frequently do this in the case of requirements documents.

Where 2119 language is used in an informational document, we have to  
be clear about why we're using it. For example, "in order to preserve  
the intent of sips: as discussed in RFC 3261, any proxy or proxy-like  
device MUST use TLS and a sips: request URI when relaying a request  
received with a sips: request URI. Failure to do so would . . . "

Here you're not talking about protocol specification, but operational  
requirements needed to meet a protocol specification.

I'm fine either way (i.e., Info with lenghty explanation, or BCP).=20
I prefer the BCP approach personally, but I'm OK either way.

What I don't like is the just changing upppercase to lowercase....

For now I guess I'll just assume Info with lenghty explanation.

Some want sips to mean "use TLS end to end" (and I don't think "end" has
been defined, as in the case of a SIP/PSTN gateway).  I think what is
really needed is a mechanism to request some minimal level of security
for the signalling and the payload.   If sips=3DTLS, what would stop a =
SBC
from using TLS/SRTP on one side and TLS/RTP on the other, sending the
audio of the call un-encrypted?    The 'whole' call is not very secure,
which probably was the original intent of sips.

Also, TLS is not the only mechanism to secure the signaling.   Is TCP
over a VPN secure?  Is UDP over a protected LAN to a protected phone in
a protected room secure?   Don't count out the devices on the network
that have other ways to secure a call.  =20

I think saying "sips"=3D"TLS end to end" is not a good idea.

After some study, I have encountered a potential difficulty in 
determining when temp-gruus expire. After discussing this with Jonathan 
we decided to bring it to the list for discussion.

As now defined, when you first register you may get a temp-gruu, which 
will remain valid as long as the registration does not expire or be 
removed. (Removal is a special case of expiration.) Each time the UA 
refreshes the registration it may get a new temp-gruu which also remains 
valid for the life of the registration. The UA can accumulate all these 
temp-gruus and use them as it sees fit until they expire.

The problem is: how does the UA know when the registration has ended and 
the temp-gruus associated with it rendered invalid?

This seems like a simple question, and in some cases it is simple, but 
not in all cases. The following are at least some of the ways that the 
registration can be ended, causing the invalidation of temp-gruus:
1) the UA that originally registered may explicitly deregister
2) the UA the originally registered may simply permit the
    registration to expire without attempting to refresh it
3) the UA may attempt to refresh the registration, but be too slow,
    so that the reregistration arrives after the prior one expires
4) some other UA may deregister all the registrations, including
    the one by this UA. (When the UA decides it should refresh the
    registration it will actually create a new one.)
5) the registrar may remove the registration administratively
6) the registrar may crash and restart, losing all its registrations

In each of these cases the previously assigned temp-gruus become 
invalid. If the UA continues to use them, bad things will happen. This 
is true both for calls that are active when the deregistration occurs, 
and calls that are established later. What kinds of bad things happen?
- requests addressed to the gruu, both in-dialog and out-of-dialog
   will be undeliverable. (For instance a reINVITE or BYE in an
   existing call, or an out-of-dialog INVITE/Replaces for a transfer.)

- request originated by the UA using the invalid gruu will fail
   immediately because the gruu is invalid.

- if the UA subsequently reregisters, receives an incoming call, and
   uses one of the old temp-gruus as its contact, then the call will
   be established, but subsequent in- and out-of-dialog requests to
   the contact will fail.

So clearly it is important for the UA to stop using temp-gruus that have 
become invalid. How can it know to do that in all of the above cases?

1) is straightforward. The UA knows it is deregistering, and should
    discard any cached temp-gruus. If it has a dialog with one of the
    temp-gruus as a contact, then it should do a target refresh and
    supply some working contact. (It really should do this *before*
    deregistering, and for a pub-gruu as well.)

2) the UA should take all the actions mentioned for (1) at or before
    the expiration time. This should be done a bit early to guard
    against clock skew problems.

3) in this case, it may be impossible for the UA to know whether
    the REGISTER arrived in time to be a reREGISTER or if it arrived
    late and was treated as a new REGISTER after the expiration of
    the old one. (The response to the REGISTER includes nothing that
    distinguishes the two cases.) About the best that can be done in
    this case is to check the time at which the response to the
    REGISTER is received. If it falls after the expected expiration
    time for the registration, act as if the old registration had
    expired.

4) This is a major problem. Of course, regardless of GRUU, the UA
    won't be able to receive incoming calls until it decides it is
    time to refresh the registration. In addition, until the
    registration reestablished, calls originated with one of its
    existing gruus will fail. Once the registration is reestablished,
    it still won't know its old temp-gruus are invalid. The only
    remedy for this is to subscribe to the "reg" event package,
    and use the resulting notifications to identify when it has
    been unregistered. If it does that, it can invalidate all its
    old temp-gruus, and then presumably reregister.

5) this is functionally equivalent to (4), except that perhaps
    attempts to reregister may fail.

6) this is also functionally equivalent to (4).

The "reg" event does provide a fairly complete solution to this problem, 
for those that are willing and able to use it. It is not however a 100% 
reliable solution. Consider case (3), where the UA has a reg event 
subscription. All is well if the registration expires and a notification 
is sent indicating that, and then the reregistration occurs and a 
notification is sent about that. But if they happen very closely in 
time, it may be that only one notification is sent, reflecting the 
result of the reregistration. In that case the UA will not be aware that 
it had been unregistered for a period of time.

A *complete* solution would, IMO, involve changing REGISTER so that it 
returns an indication of whether this was a new registration, or a 
refresh. This could take many forms. For instance the timestamp of the 
initial registration could always be returned with each contact, as well 
as the expiration time.

The big question is whether this is a big enough issue to require a 
solution now, as part of GRUU, or if it can be ignored as insignificant 
or postponed to future work.

I'd appreciate hearing what others think about this. At the moment I am 
leaning toward doing nothing, at least for now.

	Thanks,
	Paul

With my AD hat on ...

Let's figure out what this document needs to say, including normative  
language. Once we have that it will be easy to figure out if it is  
INFO, BCP, or a PS that updates 3261.

How does the UA knows whether there is a NAT or not? How does the edge

I guess some of my concerns about temporary GRUUs are starting to creep back
again. It is a question of how they are used. If a UA gives a temporary GRUU
out as a contact on a dialog and expects it to be used only during the
lifetime of that dialog, then refreshing the target if the temporary GRUU is
lost would get around the problem in most cases. There will of course be
race conditions, e.g., the UA sends out a target refresh but the remote UA
has already sent a REFER request to the old target.

What concerns me more is if there are use cases where a remote UA might want
to use a received temporary GRUU long after the dialog has terminated. If
the local UA keeps refreshing its subscription correctly and successfully,
then the temporary GRUU will remain valid. But if it is lost through
circumstances beyond the control of the local UA, then it has no means to
inform the remote UA that it is no longer valid and that a different
temporary GRUU must be used.

One example given in gruu-11 is the use of a GRUU on a web page. If a
temporary GRUU were to be used (presumably on a temporary web page), similar
considerations would apply.

Another concern is if I want to give out a different temporary GRUU to
different remote UAs, so that I can easily turn off individual temporary
GRUUs if I no longer wish to receive requests from the parties concerned.
When I first register I have only one temporary GRUU, so if I want to give
out several temporary GRUUs I would need to refresh my subscription several
times to obtain these GRUUs.

I just have an uneasy feeling that the temporary GRUU mechanism might be
somewhat orthogonal to possible use cases, although I am having difficulty
articulating particular real life use cases.

Also remember that it doesn't have to be a NAT that we have to use 
Outbound to work around either - it can be a statefull firewall as well.

Hi,

Why don't we let the edge proxy choose which keep-alive mechanism to
use?

The outbound spec should now say (I haven't had time to check, but I
hope me and Rohan agreed to add it :) that the edge proxy can insert the
keepalive parameter in the Path header.

So, we define a "CRLF" value for the parameter, and the edge proxy can
then use that value for TCP flows.

Of course, if the UA is not mandated to implement all kind of
keep-alives, it will also have to be able to indicate to the edge proxy
which keep-alive mechanisms it support.

Regards,

Christer

Having implemented STUN over TCP/TLS I can now say that it does add signifi=
cant complexity while providing little benefit over CRLF

STUN allows one to detect NAT reboot, but a CRLF will also trigger a connec=
tion reset in such a case. STUN breaks framing in case the other side does =
not support it. It uses significantly more bandwidth than CRLF. It requires=
 a lot of text to describe.

In summary, I support CRLF for TCP, and would suggest to do STUN only for U=
DP (i.e. its original purpose). STUN for TCP is a bad idea

Regards,
Jeroen

PS Edge proxy choosing the mechanism: not a good idea either, better to sim=
ply define 1 mechanism (STUN for UDP, CRLF for TCP)

The 200 OK for INVITE MUST be forwarded by the SIP server.  There is no
priority in forwarding 200 OK.   In real world scenario, once the SIP =
server
gets the first 200 OK for INVITE, it will send CANCEL to all the other =
legs.
So, the chances of getting multiple 200 OK for invite are low.


Thanks,
Neel

Hi Christer,

If we are going to revisit the keepalive decision for TCP, there is no 
reason to do STUN over TCP if you have CRLF.  Likewise, CRLF does not 
work over UDP.  So, the sensible decision would be to do STUN over UDP 
and CRLF over TCP.  The alternative is to stick with STUN over TCP for 
"consistency" (a dubious attribute to trade off against implementation 
and specification complexity).

thanks,
-rohan

Didn't we agree way back NOT to use PING, CRLF, etc., and use STUN
instead?

Why is this debate being re-opened?

Remember: I favored the non-STUN TCP approach. However, if we can't
stick to a decision,
we'll debate this forever. It already feels like it.

Christer,

The issue is not so much whether the devices can determine if a NAT is
present or not, but rather whether outbound does prohibit changing from
UDP to TCP.

I was indicating that I did not see that restriction in outbound. I went
back and took another look and see that a flow is defined in include the
protocol and a flow toke is suppose to be unique to a flow.

These two imply a one to one relationship between a flow and a flow
token. Given this, I can now see a restriction as a flow token can only
identify a single flow, which would be UDP and thus prohibit a
connection reuse scenario for a UA initiated TCP connection or a Edge
Proxy TCP initiated connection.

This relationship may need to be revisited based on some of the
mid-dialog solutions being proposed.

Kevin

How does the UA knows whether there is a NAT or not? How does the edge
proxy knows whether there is a NAT or not?

Because it seems more and more (to me at least) that Outbound with UDP 
will just suck.

If Outbound UA's have to get their act together and implement TLS/TCP, 
then we can simplify Outbound even further by skipping the whole STUN 
keepalive thing, and go with CRLF over TLS/TCP.

I am very much in favor of cutting both UDP and STUN keepalives out of 
Outbound. I think that would lead to faster deployment, and also make 
the world a better place by eliminating some SIP over UDP.

/Fredrik

PS. By the way, when people say CRLF keepalives, do you mean CRLF sent 
only from the UA, or CRLF from UA to edge proxy followed by CRLF in the 
reverse direction too?

Is your renewed concern related to this particular issue I posted? It 
doesn't seem to be.

Your concern seems to be that temporary gruus are, well, *temporary*.

Yes. In most cases this won't be an issue. And I expect that many 
implementations will simply assume that they stay registered and don't 
need to deal with the doing a target refresh because the gruu has been lost.

Yes, this is the case. Frankly I find it hard to imagine a case where a 
temp-gruu, used for anonymity, is to be used for something long after 
the dialog has terminated. I guess there could be cases, but perhaps 
they aren't so interesting.

Any kind of scheme that allowed temp gruus to live arbitrarily beyond 
the life of a registration would need some other mechanism to support 
their longevity, and also would presumably need some kind of revocation 
mechanism. It would I think need state to be kept in the network.

There may be some use for such a thing. But I think it probably calls 
for a different mechanism. One that probably isn't suitable for everyday 
anonymous calls. So I think supporting that mechanism can be viewed as 
an independent problem.

I guess it depends on how temporary the web page is.

I think we already hashed these particular issues. There are some 
unavoidable tradeoffs here.

Just to be clear what my opinion is...

I agree with you that using CRLF with TCP would
be a lot cleaner and easier to implement. It would really make
the UDP-with-STUN alternative a moot point.

That combined with people moving to TLS/TCP for security=20
reasons in my opinion means that having focused our energies on
a solution optimized for UDP was a big mistake.

The consequence is the plethora of mechanisms that people are
using today: PING, OPTIONS, CRLF, REGISTER, etc.

But in my opinion, getting the document finalized should be the
ultimate priority.

As an aside, the draft draft-fwmiller-ping-03 has expired.  While the draft
is still available at http://www.cornfed.com/ping.html and
http://www.cornfed.com/ping.txt, the question is whether it should be
resubmitted?  If there is no interest in it, I'll let it die on the IETF
site.

Thanks,

Not all architectures use TLS/TCP, some use UDP encapsulated IPsec.
Would a TCP session via UDP encapsulated IPsec be impacted by this? I do
not think it would, but just wanted to double check...

Because it seems more and more (to me at least) that Outbound with UDP
will just suck.

If Outbound UA's have to get their act together and implement TLS/TCP,
then we can simplify Outbound even further by skipping the whole STUN
keepalive thing, and go with CRLF over TLS/TCP.

I am very much in favor of cutting both UDP and STUN keepalives out of
Outbound. I think that would lead to faster deployment, and also make
the world a better place by eliminating some SIP over UDP.

/Fredrik

PS. By the way, when people say CRLF keepalives, do you mean CRLF sent
only from the UA, or CRLF from UA to edge proxy followed by CRLF in the
reverse direction too?

We have to remember that outbound can now also be used in no-NAT
scenarios, in order to support multiple simultanous registrations, in
which case keep-alives aren't needed in the first place.

Just to keep in mind.

We may still need a new value for the keepalive parameter, eventhough
specific support is probably not required in order to receive CRLFs.

...OR, we simply use the parameter without a value, to indicate that
keep-alive is supported, but the actual mechanism is then based on the
transport protocol.

I don't think "keepalive=3Dstun" would be very good in the outbound =
proxy
set either, in case the DNS lookup would result in using TCP.

Christer

Hi,

A question for clarification:

The STUN response provides the UA with certain useful information
(XOR-ADDRESS etc), which the UA can use to see whether a NAT has
rebooted etc. I assume that information is not needed when using TCP?

Regards,

Christer

I still need to test this, but I suspect that the STUN response won't even 
arrive over TCP when the NAT has rebooted and uses a different source port 
for forwarding it. The server then cannot match it with an existing 5-tuple 
socket connection and will probably send a RST

Regards,
Jeroen

I would think that UDP encapsulated IPsec would have it's own
keep-alive.
So they wouldn't need Outbound in the first place.

Otherwise all the other applications would have a NAT problem.

should use.

Maybe I missunderstood, but won't the STUN request create a new binding,
in case the NAT has rebooted?

Right.

My point was that the keep-alive didn't matter since any option will
work, and you don't need
one in the first place because the UDP/IPsec already has one.

But it just occured to me... I'm thinking VPN, and you are probably
thinking 3GPP. And I=20
don't know anything about how that works. :-)

If that's the case, you can safely ignore my posting.

Your right, I am thinking 3GPP which uses UDP encapsulated IPsec in
tunnel mode and they do leverage the keep alives provided by UDP
encapsulated IPsec if outbound is not used. If outbound is being used,
STUN keepalives are utilized (at least at this time...)

Hi Christer,

A NAT won't create a new TCP binding unless it sees a SYN.  If the NAT
reboots, the client will detect that the connection has died, and
won't be able to send any traffic (SIP or STUN) until it opens a new
connection explicitly.  An XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute over TCP is
completely useless.

thanks,
-rohan
