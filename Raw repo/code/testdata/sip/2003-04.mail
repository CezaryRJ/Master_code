Another concern is the CSeq sequence number IN CSeq Hdr field for PRACK.

1).  According to RFC3261 (12.2.1.1, requests within a dialog MUST contain 
strictly monotonically increasing and contiguous CSeq sequence numbers
(increasing-by-one)
in each direction (excepting ACK and CANCEL of course, whose numbers equal
the requests 
being acknowledged or cancelled).  

2).  RFC3262 doesn't address the CSeq Hdr field for PRACK.

3).  Personally I think it makes sense for PRACK to follow the ACK rule
regarding
the CSeq sequence numbers (the same as the initial request.

Any comment about the above?

Hello,

I think you are correct, as described in RFCs.

- CANCEL and ACK for non-2xx are related to (INVITE) TRANSACTION.
- PRACK is related to (early) DIALOG (established by INVITE).
That is why they are different.

Note that ACK for 2xx is constructed as PRACK except that it
uses routing information from 2xx not from reliable 18x.

Takuya Sawada

Yes, when you were discussing these issues within 3GPP, I already 
acknowledge this error. PRACKs should not be an exception. The only 
exceptions are CANCELs and ACKs.

We have two choices here.

1) Since you and we know that it is an errata, you add a note to your 
3GPP spec accordingly and when/if we release a revised version of 
sec-agree, we will correct it. This is what we have done with RFC3261 
and bugzilla so far.

2) We publish this errata at http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.html

For such a small thing, I would go for option 1, although I will be glad 
to publish the errata if you feel more comfortable.

Yes, I agree that adding such a clarification would help people 
understand. However, I consider this as an editorial comment, rather 
than a technical one, so I do not see a need for publishing an errata 
about this. In any event, I will log your comment and this will be 
clarified in future potential revisions of the document. Thanks.

There is no distintion. Status code is the original term, but response 
code is probably better understood by many. We may want to clarify this 
in future revisions of RFC3261.

The semantics may not be defined explicitily, but they are clear by 
reading the document.

Again, I agree with your comment, but I consider this to be an editorial 
one (clarification requested). I believe that it is clear that you have 
to re-try the same request, since this is standard behaviour in SIP. for 
example, I send a REGISTER and I get back an error code saying that the 
server cannot decrypt the request. I re-try the REGISTER, not any other 
random request...

In any event, I log your comment in order to clarify this in future 
potential revisions. Thanks.

This is actually a thing that would be good to clarify. The reason why a 
proxy can remove a sec-agree tag from a Require header is that the 
Proxy-Require header contained the sec-agree tag as well. Therefore, 
since the proxy understands sec-agree, it is safe for it to remove it. 
But in general, it would be unsafe for a proxy to remove any other tag 
in the Require header.

And the reason a client needs to add tgs to both, require and 
proxy-require is that it wants to make sure that its next hop, no matter 
if it is a proxy or a UA, uses sec-agree.

Thanks for the comments,

Cheers,

Gonzalo

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

 Hi,
The usage of Route and Record Route is still not clear to me when 1xx responses are used.

1.Should Record-Route headers be copied to any 1xx response of an early dialog?

2. Should requests sent before the dialog is established use this Record-Route list for routing the request?

3. Should the route list be replaced for each 1xx response of an early dialog or should the UAC use only the first received Record-Route list for this purpose?

Thanks,
Jay.

A dialog is established with 1xx (and early dialog). Your question should ask if requests are sent before the dialog is confirmed,  should they use this Record-Route list for routing the request. The answer is yes.

Replace. Also the 2xx that confirms the dialog replaces the route set. After that, route set is not replaceable.

which is a bad thing and should be considered a bug.

Please give consideration to the SIMPLE event-list draft:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-simple-event-list-01.txt

The SIMPLE working group has started a formal last call on this draft.

The SIP-chairs/Transport-ADs have not concluded on exactly how/if this draft
will be formally considered by the SIP working group before proceeding to
the IESG, but we should at least be aawre of the draft and assist in the
WGLC within SIMPLE to speed things up.

Thanks!

Is this the case for any 1xx, or should the 1xx be reliable?
What about 100 response.

A dialog is established with 1xx (and early dialog). Your question should ask if requests are sent before the dialog is confirmed, should they use this Record-Route list for routing the request. The answer is yes.

Replace. Also the 2xx that confirms the dialog replaces the route set. After that, route set is not replaceable.

Notice that 100 is left out of the picture.

We had long discussions on replacing the route set. It had serious 
backwards compatibility issues. We did conclude that it was possible to 
define an extension that allowed you to explicitly ask to be removed 
from the route set. So, if you feel you really need this feature, please 
go ahead and write up some reuqirements and a proposed mechanism.

For proxies, timer C is used (see section 16.8 of rfc3261). For a user 
agent, its an application problem. Only the application knows how long 
it wishes to let the phone ring before giving up.

When timer B fires, the transaction is terminated. See figure 6 of rfc3261.

Yes. Section 8.1.3.5 addresses this case:

Right. The question was, would the server do an equivalent 
post-connection validation based on that certificate. The answer is that 
it depends. In the case of a peering relationship between proxies, it 
would probably check the subjectAltName against a list of valid peers, 
and it would be a matter of policy about whether to accept or reject 
requests identified as coming from users in that domain or other domains 
(for example, rfc3325). You can also use mutual TLS to authenticate a 
UAC, typically a UAC which is an application server of some sort. The 
same kind of policy would applied depending on the type of requests the 
application was needing to generate.

The example message is not correct. The angle brackets need to be around 
the URI.

Interrestingly, RFC3329 is not the first RFC to have a proxy remove a 
proxy-require header. RFC 3323 (Privacy extensions) does the same thing 
for much the same reason. As such, I agree that this is probably a bug 
in RFC3261, and that evil table 2/3 should be modified to amr, with 
explanatory text explaining under what conditions. I don't think proxies 
can modify Require, however.

I've logged the bug into bugzilla:
http://bugs.sipit.net/sipwg/show_bug.cgi?id=707

A dialog is a sip relationship. A session is a media relationship.

Thats pretty much right.

Dialog represents state, which includes sequence numbers, route sets, 
and URIs. A request sent as part of a dialog means that it includes 
route headers from the route set of the dialog, and uses the next 
highest sequence number in the dialog.'

Outside the dialog means that it is not within the context of a dialog. 
It doesnt use the callid, cseq, or route sets of any existing dialogs, 
and when such a reuqest is set, it has no impact on the state of an 
existing dialog.

I don't think you can distinguish, and I dont think it matters. The 
value of the generic param will depend on which generic param it is. So, 
just store it as token, and when the application processes it, it can 
properly determine whether its a domain name or a token.

In general, proxies cannot modify Require. However, sec-agree is a very 
special mechanism that is inteded to be used *only* with the next hop. 
That's why the UAC adds both Proxy-Require and Require to the request. 
To cover the case where the next (first) hop is already the UAS (which 
would ignore the proxy-require header).

In any event, sec-agree lets the proxy remove the Require tag because 
the same tag (sec-agree) appears in the proxy-require, and this ensures 
that the proxy understands sec-agree and knows what it is doing when is 
removing the Require tag.

Of course, Require header removal by proxies in any other scenario would 
be very bad.

Gonzalo

Actually, my question was naive. I dont need any special feature, I just want to do things according to the standard and now I am really confused about what I should do.
I summarize below the behavior I think is according to the standard. Please correct me if Im wrong:

 Server behavior:

   When an Initial Invite is received take Record-Route list from message and build internal route list.
   Copy record route list to any 1xx (other then 100) response of the invite.
   Copy record route list to the Invite 2xx response.
   Use the route list for routing any outgoing request.
   After dialog is confirmed ignore any Record-Route header in refresh Invite requests.

 Client behavior

   When first 1xx response is received take Record Route list from the response message and build a temporary route set.
   Use this route set for any request sent before the dialog moves to the confirmed state.
   Ignore Record Route headers of other 1xx responses.
   When 2xx is received for the Invite replace the route set and use it for further requests.
   After dialog is confirmed ignore any Record-Route header in refresh Invite requests.

 Is that correct? Especially number 3 of the client behavior.

What does the standard say?

Thanks,

Jay.

go ahead and write up some reuqirements and a proposed mechanism.

Hi,

I would say number 3 for the client behaviour is correct, as long as you
remember that it is per leg (or whatever we call it nowadays...),
identified by the To header tag.

I had some issues on the changing of route set in 18x and 200, in the
"Re: [Sip] NOTIFY establishes a dialog" thread, but I haven't seen any
comments on those...

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

for example, if my dual mode (mobile network, wlan) UA has started a
dialog at a mobile network and then does a re-invite at a wlan hotspot,
i want that re-invite to change the ENTIRE route set. otherwise it is
highly likely (based on past experience on the behavior of mobile
operators) that they would keep on charging me for the rest of the call
per minute until their proxy sees the bye.  the same holds for things
like presence notifications.  i don't what them to keep on going back to
the proxy of the mobile operator.

my proposal is simply to change the route set and update the UAs
accordingly.

Hi Juha,

How can you make sure that the re-INVITE will reach the UAS, if you send it
to another proxy? Or, would you insert the WHOLE new route set in the
re-INVITE, including all the proxies between yourself and the UAS? How will
your terminal know that route set?

I am not saying it wouldn't be useful to change the route set during the
session - I am just trying to understand your example :)

What I would like to see also, is an example where it is useful to change
the route set between the 18x and 200 of the initial INVITE. In the other
mail I mentioned some issue which could came up with such behvaiour...

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

How do you change the whole route set when you use the remote-target uri to populate the request-uri? You must know the route set before hand or have to break the rule where you place the remote-target in the request-URI for requests within dialogs.

You could simply build an application that moves you into a new call but does not result in breaking your media.

i guess i didn't make myself clear.  when my UA connects to the wlan, it
learns its outbound proxy (if any) via dhcp.  it then issues a normal
invite which gets record routed by the (possible) new set of proxies.
that new recorded route will then be used for subsequent request and the
mobile operators' proxies are out of the loop.

Well, then my question is, again: how can you be sure that the re-INVITE, send to
the "new" outbound proxy, will actually reach the same UAS you are currently
having a session with?

the re-invite would be sent to the aor of the uas, i.e., not to its ip
address, and assuming that the uas is still registered, re-invite would
reach it.

by the way, like jonathan said, we should first discuss the requirements
and after that figure out the possible solutions.  and the requirement
is that when the ua moves to another network, a compete new route must
be recorded.

Thanks for the response. 
Lets say that I have the following scenario
     UA1                 B2B1           B2B2          UA2
     
     -----INV------->
     
     <----180 rel---
     
     -----PRACK----->
     
     <----200--------
                         
       
                      -----INV------->
     
                      <----180 rel---
     
     <------180 rel--     
     
     -----PRACK-----> ---PRACK-------->
     
     <----200-------- <----200--------
   
   
   If the UA1 will not update the route set according to the second 180 response the prack will never  get to B2B2.
   Is this even possible scenario?
   
Jay.

Hi,

I would say number 3 for the client behaviour is correct, as long as you
remember that it is per leg (or whatever we call it nowadays...),
identified by the To header tag.

I had some issues on the changing of route set in 18x and 200, in the
"Re: [Sip] NOTIFY establishes a dialog" thread, but I haven't seen any
comments on those...

Hi Murali,

Just as an FYI, you're looking at an old document, so it's not surprising
there might be some errors.  The call flows were moved to the SIPPING WG and
they're now in 3 separate documents:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-basic-call-flows-01.t
xt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-pstn-call-flows-01.tx
t
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-torture-tests-00.txt

And then there's a fourth document with service examples:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-04.t
xt

Regards,
Mary H. Barnes

The example message is not correct. The angle brackets need to be around 
the URI.

Not necessarily. There are no guarantees that the proxies route the request to the exact same UA. For example, there may have been a CPL script in place that takes time of day into account.

There is a contradiction within that requirement. A route set is inherent to a dialog, hence it cannot be changed without replacing the rest of the dialog, i.e., making a completely new INVITE instead of a re-INVITE.

Cheers,

Hi,
I can't find section 8.1.3.5 in the standard. Where is it?
Thanks,

Yes. Section 8.1.3.5 addresses this case:

Can I suggest you try somewhere between 8.1.3.4 and 8.2.

It is certainly there tonight, but who knows where it might be tomorrow.

Are you sure you are looking at

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt

which is the approved version as an RFC.

Hi, 
I can't find section 8.1.3.5 in the standard. Where is it? 
Thanks,

Yes. Section 8.1.3.5 addresses this case:

Hi,

Is there a way to send user defined parameter with INVITE or STATUS msg?
Since H323 uses Q931 as signaling control and Q931 has user info element =
in SETUP msg,=20
H323 can send Setup Msg with user info.

How about SIP?  If SIP can do it, could you let me know how?


Thanx

Frank

Yes, this is exactly the kind of stuff it would be useful for. In fact, 
you would issue an INVITE w. Replaces to the GRUU, and it would 
effectively replace the old call leg. Handover wont exactly be smooth, 
though....

Sure it will. These are b2buas, not proxies. Since b2b1 is a UA, it is 
responsible for generating the PRACK to the 18x received from b2b2, and 
if it wants, it can forward the 180 upstream to ua1.

Yes, all of this is correct according to the spec. Here is the words, 
from Section 12.1.2:

    When a UAC receives a response that establishes a dialog, it
    constructs the state of the dialog.  This state MUST be maintained
    for the duration of the dialog.

Note that this means that the state is set only upon creation, which 
means the first 1xx response. THis is modified by the speific behavior 
for INVITE, from 13.2.2.4:

    If the dialog identifier in the 2xx response matches the dialog
    identifier of an existing dialog, the dialog MUST be transitioned to
    the "confirmed" state, and the route set for the dialog MUST be
    recomputed based on the 2xx response using the procedures of Section
    12.2.1.2.  Otherwise, a new dialog in the "confirmed" state MUST be
    constructed using the procedures of Section 12.1.2.

hi Folks,

Would like to get some clue on following issue.

I am using "SIP express Router" as my proxy server to test our SIP user
agents.
Now if one UA(lets say party A) sends INVITE to other UA (lets say party B)
via proxy server, we are finding that any non-2xx response (like 486 busy,
603 decline) received by proxy server from party B is not forwarded to party
A. Moreover proxy server is also sending valid ACK to non-2xx response to
party B. 

	A				PS (SIP express router)
B
	|					|
|
	|----------INVITE------------>|					|
	|
|----------INVITE------------>|	
	|<---------100 trying---------|					|
	|					|<---------100

	|	603 not forwarded	      |
|
	|
|------------ACK------------->|
	|					|
|
	|					|
|
	|					|
|

any idea what may be the reason?

In case of successful call everything works fine.

will appreciate some clue from sip experts.

regards,
-nitin

Hi,
1. I am looking at the pdf version and the section numbering is different. I was under the impression I can use the pdf safely. I guess I was wrong. Do you know where I can find a pdf version with the correct numbering.
2. The section still does not say if the from-tag should remain the same or not.
For dialogs the answer should be yes but I'm not sure about registrations.

Hi

in RFC 3261 I found two different definitions for DATE header, and I don't know which one is the correct one:

In chapter 25.1 - the DATE header must have the wkday parameter. (e.g. Date: Sat, 13 Nov 2010 23:29:00 GMT)

In chapter 20.17, however, I found that "Unlike HTTP/1.1,   SIP only supports the most recent RFC 1123 [20] format for dates."

well, according to this definition, the wkday parameter is optional.

(e.g. Date: 13 Nov 2010 23:29:00 GMT)

[RFC1123]

5.2.14 RFC-822 Date and Time Specification: RFC-822 Section 5

[RFC822]

5. DATE AND TIME SPECIFICATION

5.1. SYNTAX

date-time = [ day "," ] date time ; dd mm yy; hh:mm:ss zzz

well, which definition is the correct one?

Jay

Hi All,

  I am aware that the Via line can contain parameters such as "maddr",
"ttl", "ttl", "received" and "branch".  My question-Is there is a specific
order to these parameters when they are included in the Via line.

It can't be the fault of the UAS that an incoming request has a lower
sequence number than one already seen. Therefore I think that it is very
strange for the UAS to send a 500 Server Internal Error as the text from
the RFC below states, as the UAS may not have any error that can be
repaired. Shouldn't the UAS send out a 4xx class response like 400 Out
of Sequence instead, which will indicate that the source of the error is
on the UAC side?

RFC3261 page 77, sixth line from the top
"If the remote sequence number was not empty, but the sequence number
of the request is lower than the remote sequence number, the request
is out of order and MUST be rejected with a 500 (Server Internal
Error) response."

The cseq out of order could be the fault 
of a bad UAS.  However I agree that it is 
likely the fault of the UAC sending a subsequent 
request prior to receiving acknowledgement 
of a prior request.  And yes the response
reason text of 500 can be adjusted to 
provide clarity for the given situation 
(i.e. "500 cseq value must be higher than 6").

The important thing is to communicate that
you did not process the request and that
you might be able to process the same request
with higher cseq at a later time.

I would prefer a unique response code for 
cseq out of order.  However 500 works ok in
the spirit of reusing response codes and
triggering an old UAC to potentially retry
the request.

> Shouldn't the UAS send out a 4xx class 
> response like 400 Out of Sequence instead,

The UAC is not guaranteed to be the source
of the problem.  The currently specified
4xx responses that potentially contain a
retry-after header are even less informative
than the 500.

Content-Type: text/plain;

Dear all:

I am a little confused about the relationship between a dialog and the
Call-ID:

1.	Do requests "within the same dialog" use identical Call-ID, while
requests "outside of a dialog" use different Call-ID than those =
"within"?
2.	In the last paragraph on p.16 in RFC 3261:

"This re-INVITE references the existing dialog so that the other party =
knows
that it is to modify an existing session instead of establishing a new
session."

What does the re-INVITE use to refer to the existing dialog?  Call-ID?

Thanks very much in advance.

Regards,

Patrick

How is SIP going to address session mobility ? Is there any initiative taken
up for this ?

SIP is said to be a better alternative than Mobile IP. Can I have some
latest development document references ?

Hello Patrick,

1. Yes. Message within same dialog use same Call-ID

In case of re-INVITE same Call-ID facilitates in relating  re-INVITE to the
existing session.
The (to, from, Call-ID) are maintaind same as that in original INVITE.

Subject:    [Sip] Relationship between Dialog and Call-ID


Dear all:

I am a little confused about the relationship between a dialog and the
Call-ID:

1.    Do requests "within the same dialog" use identical Call-ID, while
requests "outside of a dialog" use different Call-ID than those "within"?
2.    In the last paragraph on p.16 in RFC 3261:

"This re-INVITE references the existing dialog so that the other party
knows
that it is to modify an existing session instead of establishing a new
session."

What does the re-INVITE use to refer to the existing dialog?  Call-ID?

Thanks very much in advance.

Regards,

 Patrick

Phil:

Thanks for your answer.  Just a little more to clarify: when I send an
re-INVITE for a particular dialog, I have to use the same Call-ID, =
To/From
tag for that particular dialog?  Would the re-INVITE be forked as well?  =
If
so, what would I do with the re-INVITE?

Thanks again.

Patrick

Subject: RE: [Sip] Relationship between Dialog and Call-ID

A dialog is identified by the Call-ID, to-tag and from-tag. The Call-ID
itself is insufficient as the same INVITE may have been forked to =
several
different recipients that may all create dialogs.

	Subject:	[Sip] Relationship between Dialog and Call-ID

	Dear all:

	I am a little confused about the relationship between a dialog and
the Call-ID:

	1.	Do requests "within the same dialog" use identical Call-ID,
while requests "outside of a dialog" use different Call-ID than those
"within"?
	2.	In the last paragraph on p.16 in RFC 3261:

	"This re-INVITE references the existing dialog so that the other
party knows that it is to modify an existing session instead of =
establishing
a new session."

	What does the re-INVITE use to refer to the existing dialog?
Call-ID?

	Thanks very much in advance.

	Regards,

	Patrick

I don't think the re-invite will be forked. The re-invite most likely will
travel directly end-to-end or using route header. The forking is done only
for the first invite. Correct me if I am wrong.

Phil:

Thanks for your answer.  Just a little more to clarify: when I send an
re-INVITE for a particular dialog, I have to use the same Call-ID, To/From
tag for that particular dialog?  Would the re-INVITE be forked as well?  If
so, what would I do with the re-INVITE?

Thanks again.

Patrick

Subject: RE: [Sip] Relationship between Dialog and Call-ID

A dialog is identified by the Call-ID, to-tag and from-tag. The Call-ID
itself is insufficient as the same INVITE may have been forked to several
different recipients that may all create dialogs.

Call-ID

             Dear all:

             I am a little confused about the relationship between a dialog
and
the Call-ID:

             1.          Do requests "within the same dialog" use identical
Call-ID,
while requests "outside of a dialog" use different Call-ID than those
"within"?
             2.          In the last paragraph on p.16 in RFC 3261:

             "This re-INVITE references the existing dialog so that the
other
party knows that it is to modify an existing session instead of
establishing
a new session."

             What does the re-INVITE use to refer to the existing dialog?
Call-ID?

             Thanks very much in advance.

             Regards,

             Patrick

Subject: [Sip] Session Mobility in SIP

 

How is SIP going to address session mobility ? Is there any initiative taken
up for this ? 

 

> This has been addressed in 3GPP standards. Please refer to the 3GPP All IP
architecture specifications.

 

SIP is said to be a better alternative than Mobile IP. Can I have some
latest development document references ?

 

 

>  SIP is not going to replace Mobile IP. It is going to leverage Mobile IP
for session management in 3G wireless networks.

Dear all:

Is transaction related to dialog at all?  Or should they be seen as =
related?

It seems to me that transactions are identified by branch parameter, and
dialogs are identified by Call-ID (plus To/From tags).  But can I say =
that
an INVITE + ACK transactions create a dialog?  And does a dialog end =
with
its associated transaction, and vice versa?

To me, I see that transactions are just logical components of SIP =
elements
(like client transaction and server transaction).  They just have to be
implemented for the SIP elements to work.  However, according to RFC =
3261,
p.24 and 25:

SIP Transaction: A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server =
and
comprises all messages from the first request sent         from the =
client
to the server up to a final (non-1xx) response sent from the server to =
the
client.  If the request is INVITE         and the final response is a
non-2xx, the transaction also includes an ACK to the response.  The ACK =
for
a 2xx response to an INVITE request is a separate transaction.

It sounds like a transaction is indeed a "physical" relationship between
requests and responses.  Therefore, it sounds quite similar to the =
concept
of dialogs.

What I do not understand is that if we already have a concept of dialog, =
who
do we still need the concept of transaction?

I guess I am seriously misunderstanding the concepts here.  Can someone
please explain to me the relationship and difference between =
transactions
and dialogs?

Thanks very much in advance.

SIP Transactions are actually composed of request corresponding responses. SIP send request to initiate particular action, i.e. INVITE request send to establish call, REGISTER request is send for registartion purposes.
On other hand Dialog represents a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents that persists for some time. The dialog facilitates sequencing of
messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests
between both of them.( as mention in RFC 3261).
The concept can be explained as, when UA when to establish call with other UA, it send INVITE request, when it receives response (provisional or final), a dialog establish. Transaction ends after receiving final response e.g. 200 OK, but dialog do not end. All mid session requests (re-INVITES, REFER etc.) are composed with the help of dialog
Now UA wants to terminate call, it send BYE request to other UA and this BYE request and its response terminate dialogs at both end.

Shazia:

 

Thanks for your explanation.  However, I still have some further
questions.

 

Now I understand the difference between dialog and transaction (at least
in terms of how they end).  But it seems like the only relationship
between the two is that - transaction creates (as in INVITE) or changes
(as in re-INVITE and REFER) a dialog.  Am I right?

 

Also, according to my understanding, the transaction that you are
talking about (created by INVITE and ended by a final response) is
different than the "Client/Server Transactions" mentioned in Section 17
of RFC 3261 (where I see them as more like logical components inside SIP
elements).  Is this correct?

 

Furthermore, do mid-session requests (re-INVITE, REFER, etc.) create new
transactions (i.e. use a new branch parameter)?

 

In addition, I do not see the clear purpose of the concept of
transaction (vs. the concept of dialog).  To me, dialog is a signaling
relationship between 2 or more SIP UAs.  It already includes the concept
of a transaction, doesn't it?  In terms of describing SIP signaling or
features in general, I do not see the role of transactions in the big
picture.  Am I missing something?

 

Thanks again.

 

Regards,

 

Patrick Lam

SIP Transactions are actually composed of request corresponding
responses. SIP send request to initiate particular action, i.e. INVITE
request send to establish call, REGISTER request is send for
registartion purposes. 

On other hand Dialog represents a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between
two user agents that persists for some time. The dialog facilitates
sequencing of
messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests
between both of them.( as mention in RFC 3261). 

The concept can be explained as, when UA when to establish call with
other UA, it send INVITE request, when it receives response (provisional
or final), a dialog establish. Transaction ends after receiving final
response e.g. 200 OK, but dialog do not end. All mid session requests
(re-INVITES, REFER etc.) are composed with the help of dialog 

Now UA wants to terminate call, it send BYE request to other UA and this
BYE request and its response terminate dialogs at both end.

Shazia

Dear all:

Is transaction related to dialog at all? Or should they be seen as
related?

It seems to me that transactions are identified by branch parameter, and
dialogs are identified by Call-ID (plus To/From tags). But can I say
that
an INVITE + ACK transactions create a dialog? And does a dialog end with
its associated transaction, and vice versa?

To me, I see that transactions are just logical components of SIP
elements
(like client transaction and server transaction). They just have to be
implemented for the SIP elements to work. However, according to RFC
3261,
p.24 and 25:

SIP Transaction: A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server
and
comprises all messages from the first request sent from the client
to the server up to a final (non-1xx) response sent from the server to
the
client. If the request is INVITE and the final response is a
non-2xx, the transaction also includes an ACK to the response. The ACK
for
a 2xx response to an INVITE request is a separate transaction.

It sounds like a transaction is indeed a "physical" relationship between
requests and responses. Therefore, it sounds quite similar to the
concept
of dialogs.

What I do not understand is that if we already have a concept of dialog,
who
do we still need the concept of transaction?

I guess I am seriously misunderstanding the concepts here. Can someone
please explain to me the relationship and difference between
transactions
and dialogs?

Thanks very much in advance.

Hi,

Is there a way to send user defined parameter with INVITE or STATUS msg?
Since H323 uses Q931 as signaling control protocol and Q931 has user =
info element in SETUP msg,=20
H323 can send Setup Msg with user info.

How about SIP?  If SIP can do it, could you let me know how?


Thanx

Frank

hi Folks,

Would like to get some clue on following issue.

I am using "SIP express Router" as my proxy server to test our SIP user
agents.
Now if one UA(lets say party A) sends INVITE to other UA (lets say party B)
via proxy server, we are finding that any non-2xx response (like 486 busy,
603 decline) received by proxy server from party B is not forwarded to party
A. Moreover proxy server is also sending valid ACK to non-2xx response to
party B. 

	A				PS (SIP express router)
B
	|					|
|
	|----------INVITE------------>|					|
	|
|----------INVITE------------>|	
	|<---------100 trying---------|					|
	|					|<---------100
trying---------|
	|					|
|
	|					|<---------180
trying---------|
	|<---------180 trying---------|					|
	|					|
|
	|					|<---------603
decline--------|
	|	603 not forwarded	      |
|
	|
|------------ACK------------->|
	|					|
|
	|					|
|
	|					|
|

any idea what may be the reason?

In case of successful call everything works fine.

will appreciate some clue from sip experts.

regards,
-nitin

<P>Hi</P>
<P>&nbsp;Actually redirect server could be a part of the proxy server itself. So proxy could internally contact redirect server and get the curret location of the user.</P>

Hi,
Could somebody please let me know how spatial location information will be
requested and returned using SIP. Will it be a new header in all messages or
can SUBSCRIBE messages request NOTIFY of geo location. Also what format will
this take, will it be similar to the presence XML format? Any help would be
much appreciated.

May I ask what type of user information you would like to send? 

 

As far as I remember, the user-information message in Q.931 was pretty
much useless as far as providing user information is concerned.

 

In SIP, if you want to provide some 'end-to-end" text-based user
information, I guess you can use the Subject header in INVITE.

Patrick Lam

Subject: [Sip] How to send user defined parmameter with INVITE?

 

Hi,

 

Is there a way to send user defined parameter with INVITE or STATUS msg?

Since H323 uses Q931 as signaling control protocol and Q931 has user
info element in SETUP msg, 

H323 can send Setup Msg with user info.

 

How about SIP?  If SIP can do it, could you let me know how?

 

 

Thanx

 

Frank

Dear all:

I lost track of this a little while ago.  How is the status for =
NAT/Firewall
solution for SIP currently? =20

Is MIDCOM still the best one right now?

Actually, why does the SIP community not like the idea of opening a
particular public address (at the firewall) for an ALG, and let all the
traffic (heading any port) through to it?  I have asked many security
experts, it seems like as long as I close the corresponding sockets on =
the
ALG after the RTP sessions, allowing traffic to flow through the =
firewall
(toward the closed socket) should not cause much threat. =20

What is the current best solution for the NAT/firewall problem right =
now?

Thanks.

Patrick Lam

Transaction creates, terminate dialog + can be used for changing media session information e.g. re-INVITE transaction can be used to hold the call between two calling parties, so this transaction do not change dialog but change session information. As according to RFC 3261 pp71

 

A 2xx response to an INVITE establishes a session, and it also creates a dialog between the UA that issued the INVITE and the UA that generated the 2xx response.

 

So session created by INVITE transaction can be change by further re-INVITE transactions.

 

>Also, according to my understanding, the transaction that you are talking about (created >by INVITE and ended by a final response) is different than the Client/Server >Transactions mentioned in Section 17 of RFC 3261 (where I see them as more like >logical components inside SIP elements).  Is this correct?

 

I think transaction are objects within SIP (if talk in OO terms) created by sending/receiving a request. Maintain states and handle retransmission of request or response. They are deleted after going to TERMINATED State.

 

>Furthermore, do mid-session requests (re-INVITE, REFER, etc.) create new transactions >(i.e. use a new branch parameter)?

 

Yes.

It >already includes the concept of a transaction, doesnt it?

No, dialog keep informtion of sequencing of message (through CSeq), and routing of messages (through From, To, Route and Contact fields). They have no link with media sessions, while Transaction have link with session, also Transaction take care of request/reponse retransmissions, timer management. Dialog and Transaction are actually two different entities. May be this explanation works!!. For further explanation pls. read sections 12 & 17.

Thanks for your explanation.  However, I still have some further questions.

 

Now I understand the difference between dialog and transaction (at least in terms of how they end).  But it seems like the only relationship between the two is that  transaction creates (as in INVITE) or changes (as in re-INVITE and REFER) a dialog.  Am I right?

In addition, I do not see the clear purpose of the concept of transaction (vs. the concept of dialog).  To me, dialog is a signaling relationship between 2 or more SIP UAs.  It already includes the concept of a transaction, doesnt it?  In terms of describing SIP signaling or features in general, I do not see the role of transactions in the big picture.  Am I missing something?

 

Thanks again.

Subject: Re: [Sip] Transactions and Dialogs... Don't understand their relationship!

 

SIP Transactions are actually composed of request corresponding responses. SIP send request to initiate particular action, i.e. INVITE request send to establish call, REGISTER request is send for registartion purposes. 

On other hand Dialog represents a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents that persists for some time. The dialog facilitates sequencing of
messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests
between both of them.( as mention in RFC 3261). 

The concept can be explained as, when UA when to establish call with other UA, it send INVITE request, when it receives response (provisional or final), a dialog establish. Transaction ends after receiving final response e.g. 200 OK, but dialog do not end. All mid session requests (re-INVITES, REFER etc.) are composed with the help of dialog 

Now UA wants to terminate call, it send BYE request to other UA and this BYE request and its response terminate dialogs at both end.

Dear all:

Is transaction related to dialog at all? Or should they be seen as related?

It seems to me that transactions are identified by branch parameter, and
dialogs are identified by Call-ID (plus To/From tags). But can I say that
an INVITE + ACK transactions create a dialog? And does a dialog end with
its associated transaction, and vice versa?

To me, I see that transactions are just logical components of SIP elements
(like client transaction and server transaction). They just have to be
implemented for the SIP elements to work. However, according to RFC 3261,
p.24 and 25:

SIP Transaction: A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server and
comprises all messages from the first request sent from the client
to the server up to a final (non-1xx) response sent from the server to the
client. If the request is INVITE and the final response is a
non-2xx, the transaction also includes an ACK to the response. The ACK for
a 2xx response to an INVITE request is a separate transaction.

It sounds like a transaction is indeed a "physical" relationship between
requests and responses. Therefore, it sounds quite similar to the concept
of dialogs.

What I do not understand is that if we already have a concept of dialog, who
do we still need the concept of transaction?

I guess I am seriously misunderstanding the concepts here. Can someone
please explain to me the relationship and difference between transactions
and dialogs?

Thanks very much in advance.

Hello all,

The session timer draft (draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-10.txt) section 7.1
says:

"  A UAC which supports the session timer extension defined here MUST
   include a Supported header field in each request (except ACK),
   listing the option tag "timer" [1]. It MUST do so even if the UAC is
   not requesting usage of the session timer for this session."

Is this requirement reasonable??
Isn't it enough to send Supported header in the initial request??

Thanks for your answer in advance.

3GPP currently addresses a specific set of SIP specifications in release 5 (essentially those that currently exist at as RFCs at this moment in time). The interaction of OSA and SIP is specified in 29.998-04
 
Incorporation of SIMPLE work into the 3GPP support of SIP is part of Release 6, and is work in progress (as it still is in IETF as very few of the specifications have yet reached RFC status). Part of that release 6 work is for 3GPP WG CN5 to look at the interaction of PAM and Presence as provided by SIP. To the best of my knowledge this work is still to be done.

SIP addresses Presence and Availibility in SIMPLE and OSA/Parlay in PAM specs. How thes two are interrelated as both SIP and OSA are part of 3GPP standard.

SIMPLE is a SIP based Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol. PAM is a set
of APIs to develop Presence based Applications. Both are complimentary and
can work in wire line and wireless networks.

I suggest you look at 3GPP TS 23.141 for a view on how wireless networks propose to gather their presence information.

is it correc to say that PAM is used on wireless networks to get,set presence information and SIMPLE is used in fixed network ?

For the Require header, I was arguing for nothing more than a general case of that used in sec-agree, i.e. that the proxy must contain the application reflected by the option-tag in the Require header before that specific option-tag can be removed. I would not envisage any removal of any other option-tag.

It may also be possible to argue that for the removal to occur, it should be tested by the presence of the appropriate (i.e. the same) option-tag in a Proxy-Require header.

So I support Gonzalo in saying that this is necessary for sec-agree, but I think it would be useful to clearly state what is allowed in the respect in RFC 3261.

Please review and send corrections. Thanks.

You might notice that the datail is a little light. This could be because I
seem not to have received a copy of the notes recorded by the official
designated secretary. Oh well, there's less to type this way. So if there
are any conclusions that need to be recorded that I failed to capture in my
notes, please provide details . . .

Scribe: Ramu (notes not receivedby chairs)
Chart Room Coordinator: Not recorded

Topic: Non-invite transactions, Robert Sparks.

The slides presented are included in the proceedings.

Poll == who as read and understands the draft, app. 20%. Discusssion:
Principle problem is the race condition of 64*T1 built into the protocol.
Given non-zero latency, the UAS side has an offset on this time, so the
client may time out before the server completes. Now we just try and
"complete as soon as possible" giving response codes like 408 that make no
sense -- by the time it gets back to the UAC, the UAC is assured of having
timed out, creating a 408 storm. Other problems exist with intermediary
timeouts and with forking convergence.

Two solutions offered: A and B. Rohan argues against proposal B, preferring
the subscribe/notify style of seperate transactions. Point: What if values
of T1 are different? Discussion: If UAS and UAC have different values of T1,
it's all broken anyhow. Extended discussion follows. Two problems: the
infrequent 1 in 10,000 events, and the problem that the 200 has to be
emitted soon enough to have a high probability to make it back to the UAC
before the 408s. Most troubling is when the UAS thinks the situation is
200ok, but the UAC has a different view (which can happen with non-invite
forking). Point that we should lift the constraint on interoperability with
existing proxies. Suggestion we adhoc during this meeting for consensus --
group to email Robert for gathering. Note:  a detailed adhoc on this topic
was held later and the minutes seperately included in the proceeedings.


Topic: Referred-by, Robert Sparks

The slides presented are included in the proceedings.

Complaint: nobody is giving feedback. Are people mostly happy and just
waiting on some of the blocking work to complete? A chairs asks for
volunteers to provide feedback: Brian Rosen, Mary Barnes, Alan Johnston,
Pekka Pessi all volunteer.

Issue: Use of Call-ID seems to be required in auth-ID-body. Is it a leak?
Should we put garbage in, change the AID body format, or what? Jon Peterson
reports that the newest AIB draft relieves this requirement.

Issue: Referred identity binding between REFER and INVITE. Can a referee
assert a different identity on the generated INVITE than was referenced in
the REFER? Can humans make the distinction? No resolution of this issue in
this meeting, but it seems to relate to the URI Leasing work ongoing in
SIPPING.


Topic: Resource-Priority, Henning Schulzrinne

The slides presented ARE NOT currently included in the proceedings but have
been requested and may be received in time.

Goal: Higher priority of emergency call completion during service disruption
of civil emergency, especially in interworking with PSTN. Requirements are
establised in RFC3487.  List discussion reviewd, best option a new header.
Discussion about whether it is "good" to have proxies understand this.
Consensus: Work on this problem, starting from this draft as a baseline, but
address additional opinions and requirements as raised in the WG process.


Topic: Caller Preferences, Jonathan Rosenberg

The slides presented are included in the proceedeings.

Issue: Needs a thorough review of the current draft, which seems pretty much
"done".

Volunteers to review -- Robert Sparks,  Mary Barnes, Pekka Pessi, Bob
Penfield,  Cullen Jennings. The plan is to review, feed back, revise, go to
2 week WGLC.


Topic: Congestion Safety, Dean Willis and Hisham Khartabil

Presentation by Dean Willis. Slides presented included in the proceedings.

General poll indicates that after reading the draft, nobody understands how
it works. People seem to have the vague feeling that the topic is important
but are not cognizant of the implications. Suggestion made that "congestion
safe" is a misnomer, as nothing is "safe".  No consensus reported.

Presentation by Hisham Khartabil. Slides presented included in proceedings.

One point made from audience is that implementors do not see immediate
value. Proposed by one speaker that we should consider response-CI as a
possible alternate mechanism in primary work. No consensus reported.

Topic: Auth-ID Issues, Jon Peterson

Slides presented are currently NOT in the proceedings but have been
requested.

The only new "SIP" function is the new 400-response code. Other functions
are non-normative.   No poll for consensus recorded.

This document defines the REFER method.  This Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) extension requests that the recipient REFER to a
resource provided in the request.  It provides a mechanism allowing
the party sending the REFER to be notified of the outcome of the
referenced request.  This can be used to enable many applications,
including call transfer.

In addition to the REFER method, this document defines the the refer
event package and the Refer-To request header.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG with the message body

Hi Keith,

I hope you can help me.
I'm trying to understand what are the main topics of Release 6
(as for Release 5 was the introduction of IMS and for Release 4 the =
architectural split  in MSC and the HSS).

Can you send me or suggest some link or papers/articles explain this ?


Moreover can you suggest what look in 3GPP for view on how wireless =
network propose to use Instant Messaging ?


best regard
Salvatore Loreto

Dear all:

On p.80 of RFC 3261, it states that:

"If the initial offer is in an INVITE, the answer MUST be in a reliable
non-failure message from UAS back to UAC which is correlated to that =
INVITE.
For this specification, that is only the final 2xx response to that =
INVITE.
That same exact answer MAY also be placed in any provisional responses =
sent
prior to the answer.  The UAC MUST treat the first session description =
it
receives as the answer, and MUST ignore any session descriptions in
subsequent responses to the initial INVITE."

My questions are:
1.	Is the answer from 1xx valid then???  If so, why does it state that
the answer can only be present in 2xx on one hand, but on the other hand =
if
the answer is present in 1xx, the answers from 2xx must be ignored???=20
2.	What about the UAS "changes" its mind on the answer after it sends
1xx response (e.g. the callee answers the call from a different UA), and
wants to incorporate the changes into 2xx responses????
3.	Can 100 Trying carry 'answers"?

Thanks very much in advance,

Patrick

Dear all:

On p.89 of RFC3261,

"If, however, it is unacceptable to the UAC, the UAC SHOULD generate an
answer with a valid session description, and then send a BYE to =
terminate
the session."

Questions:
1.	How is the answer carried toward the UAS?  Through ACK?
2.	Why does the UAC have to generate a valid answer, when it is going
to terminate the session right away?  I believe it wants to let the UAS =
know
what it will accept with the hope that the UAS will generate an =
acceptable
response in the next call, right??  However, there is no specification
(unless I missed it) here to state that the UAS has to 'remember" what =
the
UAC does not accept.  It seems to me that generating this valid answer =
is
quite unnecessary.
3.	Can the UAC terminate the session without sending the valid answer?
That is, can the UAC send a BYE without sending the ACK first (assuming =
the
UAS would know what this means)?

Thanks very much in advance,

Patrick Lam

Subject:  [Sip] Questions regarding Offer/Answer model...




Dear all:

On p.80 of RFC 3261, it states that:

"If the initial offer is in an INVITE, the answer MUST be in a reliable
non-failure message from UAS back to UAC which is correlated to that
INVITE.
For this specification, that is only the final 2xx response to that INVITE.
That same exact answer MAY also be placed in any provisional responses sent
prior to the answer.  The UAC MUST treat the first session description it
receives as the answer, and MUST ignore any session descriptions in
subsequent responses to the initial INVITE."

My questions are:
1.   Is the answer from 1xx valid then???  If so, why does it state that
the answer can only be present in 2xx on one hand, but on the other hand if
the answer is present in 1xx, the answers from 2xx must be ignored???
-> Yes,the answer from 1xx is valid,provided that is transmitted reliably.
-> This talks about 2xx response alone because,the RPR's(Reliable
provisional
-> responses)are not part of RFC 3261 and is part of RFC 3262.
-> An Answer can be sent in any RPR(180,182,183) and the same answer can be
-> echoed back in 2xx responses.
2.   What about the UAS "changes" its mind on the answer after it sends
1xx response (e.g. the callee answers the call from a different UA), and
wants to incorporate the changes into 2xx responses????
->UAS *CANNOT* Change the answer when sending 2xx response.If it decides to
change the media
-> parameters it needs to do so by sending a UPDATE Request.(Refer RFC
3311).
3.   Can 100 Trying carry 'answers"?
-> NO.100 Trying is never transmitted reliably,hence cannot contain SDP.
->Moreover its mostly the proxy which sends 100 trying.

Thanks very much in advance,

Patrick

Subject:  [Sip] Questions on UAC behavior when the response is
      unacceptable.




Dear all:

On p.89 of RFC3261,

"If, however, it is unacceptable to the UAC, the UAC SHOULD generate an
answer with a valid session description, and then send a BYE to terminate
the session."

Questions:
1.   How is the answer carried toward the UAS?  Through ACK?
->Yes.
2.   Why does the UAC have to generate a valid answer, when it is going
to terminate the session right away?  I believe it wants to let the UAS
know
what it will accept with the hope that the UAS will generate an acceptable
response in the next call, right??  However, there is no specification
(unless I missed it) here to state that the UAS has to 'remember" what the
UAC does not accept.  It seems to me that generating this valid answer is
quite unnecessary.

->Here *Valid Answer* means a valid SDP formed according to the
Offer/Answer Model.
-> All streams in the Offer will be rejected by the UAC by setting the port
to 0 in this
-> Valid Answer.

3.   Can the UAC terminate the session without sending the valid answer?
That is, can the UAC send a BYE without sending the ACK first (assuming the
UAS would know what this means)?
-> NO NO.This is Protocol non-conformance.By doing this you will break two
things.
-> One you are NOT generating an ACK,which is mandatory according to RFC
3261
-> and other you are not sending an Answer for an Offer according to RFC
3264.

Thanks very much in advance,

Patrick Lam

The current text in draft-ietf-sip-scvrtdisco-03.txt says, in "6.3
Procedures at the Registrar":

   A REGISTER operation performing a Fetching Bindings (i.e.  no Contact
   header field is present in the request) SHOULD return the same value
   of Service-Route as returned in the corresponding previous REGISTER
   response for the address-of-record in question.  In some cases, the
   Service-Route may be dynamically calculated by the registrar rather
   than stored, and the decision as to whether this route should be
   recalculated in the event of a Fetching Bindings operation is left to
   the implementation.


Ben Jenkins pointed out to me that this may be unclear in cases where there
are multiple contacts registered for a specific AoR.

We do not state explicitly that the Service Route is common to all contacts
for the AoR. Is it really? Do we need to add anything here for clarity?

Dear all:

On p.110 of RFC 3261, it states:

"After a final response has been sent on the server transaction, the
following responses MUST be forwarded immediately:
         -  Any 2xx response to an INVITE request"

I am just wondering why the proxy would still forward a 2xx after =
sending
another final response.  Does this mean that after sending, say a 4xx
response upstream, the proxy should still forward a 2xx response =
upstream? =20

I think I am confused about the wording here.  Why the "final response" =
is
*sent*, while the "2xx response" is *forwarded*?  Also, isn't 2xx a =
final
response as well?

At a later paragraph, RFC 3261 states:

"This step, combined with the next, ensures that a stateful proxy will
forward exactly one final response to a non-INVITE         request, and
either exactly one non-2xx response or one or more 2xx responses to an
INVITE request."

I do not see how this conclusion can be drawn.  Nothing about =
"non-INVITE"
request has been mentioned in this section ('Check response for =
forwarding')
at all.  Can someone please spend a little time to explain to me how =
this
conclusion is drawn from the previous paragraphs?

Thanks very much in advance.

Patrick Lam

Dear all:

What exactly is "response context" being mentioned in RFC 3261 (p.107)?  =
Why
would a response context contain multiple responses (so that a proxy has =
to
choose the best one)?  Should there be only one appropriate response to =
be
forwarded by the proxy at any particular time?  For example, after =
receiving
a response downstream, the proxy would (at least for most cases) forward
this same response upstream, right?

I think I am missing some important concept about response context here.
Can someone please explain?

Thanks very much in advance.

Patrick Lam

> Dear all:
> 
> On p.80 of RFC 3261, it states that:
> 
> "> If the initial offer is in an INVITE, the answer MUST be in a reliable non-failure message from UAS back to UAC which is correlated to that INVITE.  For this specification, that is only the final 2xx response to that INVITE.  That same exact answer MAY also be placed in any provisional responses sent prior to the answer.  The UAC MUST treat the first session description it receives as the answer, and MUST ignore any session descriptions in subsequent responses to the initial INVITE.> "> 
> 
> My questions are:
> 1.	Is the answer from 1xx valid then???  If so, why does it state that the answer can only be present in 2xx on one hand, but on the other hand if the answer is present in 1xx, the answers from 2xx must be ignored??? 
[Chen Zaifeng,BISC TD DEW5(BJ)]  
1xx is valid, of course, and:
Firstly, the 2xx must contain an answer
Secondly, the 1xx non-reliable may contain an answer, but must be the same as the one in 2xx
Lastly, The UAC will accept the first answer which might in 2xx or 1xx (the same answer)
Therefore, I think the description picked out from rfc3261 has nothing to do with rfc3262 
> 2.	What about the UAS > "> changes> ">  its mind on the answer after it sends 1xx response (e.g. the callee answers the call from a different UA), and wants to incorporate the changes into 2xx responses????
[Chen Zaifeng,BISC TD DEW5(BJ)]
UAS can not changes its mind...
P80 of RFC 3261:
 o  Once the UAS has sent or received an answer to the initial
     offer, it MUST NOT generate subsequent offers in any responses
     to the initial INVITE.  This means that a UAS based on this
     specification alone can never generate subsequent offers until

[Chen Zaifeng,BISC TD DEW5(BJ)]  
I think it can not.
100 trying is an unreliable "automatic response" that is generated  by transaction layer,
it might not be aware of session description which provided by TU, check 17.2.1 of rfc3261
for more.
And, P183, 21.1.1 of rfc3261:
The 100 (Trying) response is different from other provisional responses, in that it is never
forwarded upstream by a stateful proxy.

  [Chen Zaifeng,BISC TD DEW5(BJ)]  
  1xx is valid, of course, and:
  Firstly, the 2xx must contain an answer
  Secondly, the 1xx non-reliable may contain an answer, but must be the same as the one in 2xx
  Lastly, The UAC will accept the first answer which might in 2xx or 1xx (the same answer)
  Therefore, I think the description picked out from rfc3261 has nothing to do with rfc3262 

  [Nataraju A.B.]
  The SDP parameters carried in the 1xx response should be same as that could be carried in teh 2xx response. since SDP parameters to be sent back is same in both the states. This also can be justified by the fact that the SDP parameters are all preconfigured one's. The same info is available when UAS is replying back with alerting indication(180 RINGING ) OR connect request(200 OK)


  > 2. What about the UAS > "> changes> ">  its mind on the answer after it sends 1xx response (e.g. the callee answers the call from a different UA), and wants to incorporate the changes into 2xx responses????
  [Chen Zaifeng,BISC TD DEW5(BJ)]
  UAS can not changes its mind...
  P80 of RFC 3261:
   o  Once the UAS has sent or received an answer to the initial
       offer, it MUST NOT generate subsequent offers in any responses
       to the initial INVITE.  This means that a UAS based on this
       specification alone can never generate subsequent offers until
       completion of the initial transaction.

  [Nataraju A.B.]
  Chen Zaifeng's comments are correct, since the information available in TU will be same in both the alerting indication (180 RINGING ) state as well as connect request(200 OK)

  > 3. Can 100 Trying carry > '> answers> "> ?
  [Chen Zaifeng,BISC TD DEW5(BJ)]  
  I think it can not.
  100 trying is an unreliable "automatic response" that is generated  by transaction layer,
  it might not be aware of session description which provided by TU, check 17.2.1 of rfc3261
  for more.
  And, P183, 21.1.1 of rfc3261:
  The 100 (Trying) response is different from other provisional responses, in that it is never

It is defined in section 16.6:

When a proxy forks, it will get responses for each forked response. 
Those are held in the response context.

I would be surprised if its the same. After all, the Contacts could have 
been registered from completely different visited networks. Ideally, 
there is one service route per contact, and so the REGISTER response 
would indicate a service route for each contact in the response. That 
would be a big change from whats in the spec now though.

Really, the problem is that sec-agree needs a new type of Require 
header, which is "Next-Hop-Require". It means that the recipient of a 
request with this header must understand the extension, and if it does, 
remove that header, else reject the request. Of course, you can't 
introduce the Next-Hop-Require header field as an extension without 
using Proxy-Require and Require in the request, which sort of brings you 
back to square one.

I must admit I am not fond of the idea of a proxy removing a Require 
header under any circumstances, but I don't see a better solution given 
that this needs to be introduced in a backwards compatible way. In that 
case, Keith's suggested semantics seem right. I'll make a note in 
bugzilla about it.

There are many solutions. draft-ietf-sipping-nat-scenarios describes 
some of them. The net/net from that draft is that its all a big mess, 
with differing solutions in differing cases. TO deal with that, I have 
recently proposed a unifying mechanism called ICE:

> 
> Is MIDCOM still the best one right now?

MIDCOM is still unspecified. But, if/when it arrives, it won't cover 
many cases. It has the fundamental problem that it requires the agent to 
know the precise location of the firewalls/nats on the media path. This 
is pretty much a show-stopper in a lot of topologies. For example, in 
the case where you have a nat in your house, which your PC can control 
with midcom, there still may be a nat on the cable provider network, 
which you will not know about. Protocols like STUN and TURN (both of 
which are used by ICE) don't have this kind of limitation.

The long term right-answer is based on nsis, when all of the 
firewalls/nats support it. But thats a long ways off.

It is not unreasonable, and there are products on the market that 
basically work like this. This kind of approach has the benefit compared 
to midcom of not requiring firewall changes per se. However, it does 
require the deployment of some kind of box which will act as a media 
relay. That increases overall cost and introduces requirements for more 
bandwidth in the DMZ to handle the relay. This relay can be a b2bua or a 
TURN server or equivalent.

Note that, with ICE, the traffic through this relay can be substantially 
reduced, using it only for calls that actually end up going to endpoints 
outside the firewall.

Well, if you want my biased opinion, it is STUN and TURN in conjunction 
with ICE. I owe the wg a draft that describes how this optimally handles 
all of the cases in draft-ietf-sipping-nat-scenarios with a single 
client-side mechanism.

The BNF is authoritative, so this is correct.

I admit this text is confusing. You need to also look at http 1.1, which 
explicitly says it supports a fixed-length subset of the 1123 format. 
What this text was meant to say is that we ONLY use this fixed length 
1123 subset, as opposed to the other date formats supported in HTTP 1.1. 
Anyway, I will log this as a bug to just remove the sentence.

Don't use the PDF. Its not official. Use the .txt.

Here is the text from 8.1.3.5:

In all of the above cases, the request is retried by creating a new
    request with the appropriate modifications.  This new request
    constitutes a new transaction and SHOULD have the same value of the
    Call-ID, To, and From of the previous request, but the CSeq should
    contain a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous.

Since the tag is part of the value of the From header field, this means 
that the tag remains the same.

Thanks for your response.I also saw this paragraph but was confused since in the draft-ietf-sipping-basic-call-flows-02.txt the From tags are different.Jay.  Jonathan Rosenberg <jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com> wrote:

Here is the text from 8.1.3.5:

In all of the above cases, the request is retried by creating a new
request with the appropriate modifications. This new request
constitutes a new transaction and SHOULD have the same value of the
Call-ID, To, and From of the previous request, but the CSeq should
contain a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous.

Since the tag is part of the value of the From header field, this means 
that the tag remains the same.

Dear all:

On p.53 of 3261, it states that:

"CANCEL requests can be constructed and sent by both proxies and user agent
clients."

But on p.92 of 3261, it states that:

"The proxy SHOULD NOT initiate a CANCEL request."

In many other places of the spec, proxies are able and required to generate
CANCEL request in some scenarios.  Therefore, is the sentence on p.92 a
typo?  Or am I missing the hidden meaning of it?

Thanks very much in advance.

Patrick Lam

Understood.

But why does the proxy not forward all the responses to the UAC (each of
them will be identified by the dialog ID), and let the UAC handle the
responses separately?  E.g. someone in the conference requiring
authentication may send 401, while the others are all sending 2xx's.  If
the UAC also receives 401 from that particular user, it can follow-up
with appropriate authentication.

From my gut feeling, choosing the *best* response among the response
context is just not a perfect way to handle forking.  

I must be wrong, however.

Patrick -

You are more likely to get quick answers to these kinds of questions if
you ask them on the sip-implementor's list. See

You need to read the sentences that come right before it as well. This
paragraph talks about proxies making a transition between being 
transaction stateful and transaction stateless - a proxy should not
generate a cancel when making that transition.

I doubt this applies to conferencing case. The forking is done by proxy to
reach different contact addresses of the same user as per AOR record.  So,
being stateful, it maintains a response context for the forwarded request
and stores all the incoming responses from various paths and forwards the
best one.

P.S: sip-implementors list is the better place to discuss such issues.

Understood.

But why does the proxy not forward all the responses to the UAC (each of
them will be identified by the dialog ID), and let the UAC handle the
responses separately?  E.g. someone in the conference requiring
authentication may send 401, while the others are all sending 2xx's.  If
the UAC also receives 401 from that particular user, it can follow-up
with appropriate authentication.

From my gut feeling, choosing the *best* response among the response
context is just not a perfect way to handle forking.

I must be wrong, however.

Hi Robert,

Based on the action I took in San Francisco, I've recently reviewed the
draft and have the following comments. Some are just editorial nits, others
relate to the discussion in San Francisco (and likely you're already
planning these changes) and a few new items for discussion.  

Editorial Nits:
-------------------
- Abstract:  third sentence: I would propose to reword this and change the
word "reference" to "referenced request"  (it may be just me but I had to
read that several times to convince myself that it said what it should have;
or perhaps you could write the word "reference" as "REFER-ence")

- Section 7.3, second sentence: "choses" -> "chooses" or "chose"

- References: identity, authid-body and cc-transfer need upversioning.

Per discussion in San Francisco:
------------------------------------------------
- Section 4: Call-ID should not be used for the token, thus the open issue
in section 4 & 9 (Issue 2)  is closed, with the 2nd paragraph to be updated
appropriately.  Per the discussion, the most recent Authid-body draft
addresses the REFER as a special case where the Call-ID cannot be used. 

- Section 4.1: 3rd paragraph suggesting that the target verify the identity
in the FROM in the token matches the SubjectAltName from the signing
certificate.  As I recall, it was highlighted during the discussion that the
referrer may not have a certifcate matching that field, thus I think it was
ageed to remove that (but my detailed notes are not conclusive, nor are
those on the SIP webpage).  Thus, the first Open Issue in that section is
closed. This is also listed as Issue 3 in section 9 and I think the
conclusion is that the Referred-by should be the identity reflected in the
Token. 

-Section 4.1: 2nd issue (also listed as Issue 4 in section 9) around
restricting the referree to use the To value from the original dialog as the
From.  There was no conclusion around this issue and I really think you
don't want to do that. I think you could actually use History-Info (for the
Referrer to indicate it's identity).  Refers are identified as a form of
retargeting in the requirements document. Although, I don't think the
current normative text in the solution draft fully takes this into account,
but it should.  Thus, if you have the security around History-Info, then you
can be certain that the referrer did send that refer to this particular
referee (per your Issue 1 in section 9). 

Other items:
--------------------------------------
- Section 2.1: Propose to add a final paragraph (or another sentence to the
current final paragraph) similar to the following to this section to
indicate what the Referrer should do upon receipt of a 429:
"Upon receipt of a 429 response, if the Referrer still wishes to REFER to
the target, a Referred-by token MUST be included in the referenced request."

- Section 2.3: Last paragraph: should this be a MUST (reject an otherwise
well-formed request with an invalid token)?   Reasonably, one should, but
perhaps there are users that would still like to be able to decide
themselves, thus I would suggest this be stated similar to the previous
paragraph as:

"The refer target SHOULD reject an otherwise well-formed request with an
invalid Referred-By token (see Section 4) with a 429 error response. If the
agent chooses to proceed with the request and provides any information from
the Referred-By header to its user as part of processing the request, it
MUST notify the user that the information was determined to be invalid." 

My reasoning is that it just seems that if an optional parm is mucked up (in
general or from a security perspective), then following the adage of being
generous in what you accept ...that whether to accept the request, provided
that it is warned that it's bad,  should still be up to the user.  This also
seems consistent with the MAYs in the previous 2 paragraphs. I do understand
the reasoning that you'd want to let the Referrer know and that by allowing
the request, you're actually bypassing the security put in place to keep the
bad guys from mucking with the messages, but again since it's optional, it
just seems that you can't make it stronger than a SHOULD. 

- Section 4.1:  2nd paragraph suggesting that "A target SHOULD verify the
request...".  I don't think this is useful since retargeting makes this
check not meaningful.  UNLESS, of course, you're using History-Info.  With
History-Info, you could verify that the Refer-To matches one of the
Targeted-to-URIs (and of course, this implies that this information has all
been sent securely, not mucked with by the proxies, etc.).

Hi all,

I have a problem considering Registration while I' m working with Cisco

Could anyone help me?
I have used several other proxies including  ser and everything was fine.


Thanks in advance.

So? The Service-Route does not contain information about the visited network
-- just information about the home network -- the "specific home proxy or
network of proxies" from which services are being requested.

See the Applicability Statement:

   2.  The registrar has knowledge of a service proxy that should be
       used by the UA when requesting services from the domain of the
       registrar.  This knowledge may be a result of dynamic assignment
       or some other mechanism outside the scope of this document.
   3.  The registrar(s) has/have sufficient knowledge of the network
       topology, policy, and situation such that a reasonable service
       route can be constructed.

Since one can reasonably assume that the registrar has NO explicit knowledge
about the foreign/visited network from which the UA registered, the service
route does not contain data about that network. Clearly the UA and the
visited network have enough routing data to be able to get a REGISTER
request to the edge of the home network (since we're building this route in
the response to that REGISTER request).

> Ideally, 
> there is one service route per contact, and so the REGISTER response

> would be a big change from whats in the spec now though.

True. There MIGHT be a difference on the preferred route through the home
network depending on which visited network (and consequently, Contact) is
involved. One can envision using a Service Route-like mechanism to assign a
firewall proxy on a per-contact basis. Such an approach is not supported in
the current draft, which we might point out has completed WGLC and IETF LC
and probably shouldn't be changed (especially substantively) unless there's
a glaring error.

At about this point I should say "Gee, it would have been nice to be able to
use a loose-routing syntax in the actual Contact value (and in fact
everywhere that a URI is given), but that wouldn't have been backward
compatible."


Open Question: Is the additional capability being proposed here important
enough to change the spec at this time, or is it something we should
consider in future work?

This was a long-time-ago design decision, to avoid a flood of non-200 
responses in cases where there was wide forking. It has been in the 
specs since rfc2543.

My bad. You're right. I think I had Path in mind.

I think we can consider it in the future. You just need to be clear in 
the draft that there is ONE service route across all registered contacts.

So we can expect that an Invite request will still be able to arrive to 
the edge-proxy. If we keep the edge-proxy out of the service-route, 
wouldn't it  make the service route for a AoR identical for any
number of contacts? Teorethically isn't it correct to claim that for 
each AoR we'll have the same
route within the home network,  if we can just take out the edge-proxy?

So? The Service-Route does not contain information about the visited network
-- just information about the home network -- the "specific home proxy or
network of proxies" from which services are being requested.

See the Applicability Statement:

   2.  The registrar has knowledge of a service proxy that should be
       used by the UA when requesting services from the domain of the
       registrar.  This knowledge may be a result of dynamic assignment
       or some other mechanism outside the scope of this document.
   3.  The registrar(s) has/have sufficient knowledge of the network
       topology, policy, and situation such that a reasonable service
       route can be constructed.

Since one can reasonably assume that the registrar has NO explicit knowledge
about the foreign/visited network from which the UA registered, the service
route does not contain data about that network. Clearly the UA and the
visited network have enough routing data to be able to get a REGISTER
request to the edge of the home network (since we're building this route in
the response to that REGISTER request).</pre>

So we can expect that an Invite request will still be able to arrive to the
edge-proxy. If we keep the edge-proxy out of the service-route, wouldn't
it&nbsp; make the service route for a AoR identical for any <br>
number of contacts? Teorethically isn't it correct to claim that for each

True. There MIGHT be a difference on the preferred route through the home
network depending on which visited network (and consequently, Contact) is
involved. One can envision using a Service Route-like mechanism to assign a
firewall proxy on a per-contact basis. Such an approach is not supported in
the current draft, which we might point out has completed WGLC and IETF LC
and probably shouldn't be changed (especially substantively) unless there's
a glaring error.

At about this point I should say "Gee, it would have been nice to be able to
use a loose-routing syntax in the actual Contact value (and in fact
everywhere that a URI is given), but that wouldn't have been backward
compatible."


Open Question: Is the additional capability being proposed here important
enough to change the spec at this time, or is it something we should
consider in future work?

Vijay, I'm confused.

Last I checked, draft-ietf-simple-presence discussed presence, and to my 
knowledge it wasnt specific to wireline or wireless, but to any network 
that used IP. I am not sure what relation spirits has. I certainly hope 
you are not proposing that spirits represents a presence protocol 
specific for wireline?

Can This be possible ???

What I understood is UAS reply back with 200 OK only after all the necessay steps have been taken against that registration request. 

I feel this can happen only when you send a REGISTER request to multicast server (not in case of Unicast servers) . 
In that case the 1st final response will be considered and later ones will be discardeed.

  Hi all,

Heavens, no.  The original poster wanted to know which network
elements may contribute to the derivation of presence information
for fixed-line networks; and that's where the tie-in to SPIRITS
comes in.

Rest assured, I am not proposing yet another presence protocol for
wireline networks.  In fact, if you skim over my implementation
I-D, I reuse the application/cpim+pidf MIME type and all the other
work in IMPP and SIMPLE WGs.

Here are my comments caller prefs draft. I apologize for their 
tardiness.

The only technical issue is the processing of require and explicit 
tags (see item 12 below). The spec says that the explicit flag is
checked first and then the require flag. It seems to me it should
be the other way around.

The rest of the items are inconsistencies in requirements, some
suggestions for improving the readability/usability of the spec,
and typos.

1) Page 7: Insert "the" or "a" between "describes" and "full" in
the last line of the "Feature Set" definition.

2) The concept of base-tags (and using "+" for other tags) is not
mentioned until section 7.2.1. I think they should be mentioned in 
the overview, or at least the first time the spec talks about what 
feature tags can be used (section 6.1).

3) In section 6.2, it says "Proxy-Require: pref" MAY be included, 
but in the very next sentence it says that it is NOT RECOMMENDED.
This seems to be a conflict as "MAY" is not equivalent to "NOT 
RECOMMENDED". I personally prefer NOT RECOMMENDED. I suggest text 
along the lines of:

    A UAC SHOULD NOT include a Proxy-Require header with a
    value of "pref" unless it is reasonably certain that all
    proxies along the path between the UAC and the proxy
    responsible for the domain of Request-URI support the
    "pref" extension.

4) Section 6.2.2 says "Each feature set MUST follow the 
constraints of section 6.1". However, not all the requirements 
in section 6.1 apply to Feature Set Preferences. I recommend that 
the 3rd and 4th paragraphs on page 12, and the 2nd and 3rd 
paragraph on page 13 be placed in a separate Feature Set 
Constraints section preceding the existing section 6.1, and 
have 6.1 and 6.2.2 refer to the new section. However, the 
requirement in the 2nd paragraph on page 13 for the UA to "list 
all values it supports" does need to be reworded to say that when 
expressing capabilities it must list all values that it supports 
and when expressing preferences it must list all values it 
desires.

5) The last sentence of the 2nd paragraph of section 6.2.2 repeats 
a requirement in 6.1 and can be removed.

6) Suggest including a sample Accept-Contact and/or Reject-Contact 
in section 6.2.2 to help in understanding feature set preferences.

7) Suggest including a reference to sections 8, 8.2 and 10 in 
section 6.2.2 (similar to that in 6.2.1 for Request-Disposition).

8) Should the requirement for using different contact URIs (3rd 
paragraph of section 6.4) be in section 6.1 since it applies to 
expressing capabilities in a registration?

9) The two requirements in the 2nd paragraph of section 7 are 
confusing to me. The first states that a proxy may add a value to 
an existing header field, but the second says that a proxy must 
not modify an existing header field.

10) In section 7.2, it says "SHOULD apply the processing in this 
section" and "MUST do so as described below". When I first read 
it, I interpreted it to mean section 7.2 (which encompasses 7.2.1, 
7.2.2, and 7.2.2.1 too), but clearly section 7.3 and 7.4 also 
apply. You may want to explicitly enumerate the required sections 
or renumber them such that they all fall within 7.2.

11) The last paragraph on page 22 uses the term "contact set" 
rather than "target set". Should it be "target set"?

12) Page 23 & Figure 1: Shouldn't the require tag be checked first 
rather than the explicit flag? On page 15 it says:

    If one of the values contains the "require" parameter,
    it means that the UA must match that value.

In the example in section 7.4.1, u2 is discarded because the first 
predicate has a require tag. However, if you follow the flow 
chart, u2 would get a score of 0. In order to make my test program 
generate the same results as in the example, I had to check the 
require flag first.

13) The tables in section 8 indicates that a proxy may add and/or 
remove Accept_Contact, Reject-Contact, and Request-Disposition 
headers, but the text in section 7 says a proxy MUST NOT remove 
the header values.

14) Section 9 says "new media feature tags MAY be registered with 
IANA". Given the requirements in section 6.1, shouldn't this say 
"New media feature tags MAY be defined and they MUST be registered 
with IANA"?

15) Section 9: For those feature tags whose values are defined in 
an IANA registry, the specific registry should be referenced to 
find the appropriate values for the tag (as suggested by RFC 
2506). Section 9.13 needs to refer to the IANA "SIP Parameters - 
Methods" registry for valid method names. Section 9.14 (SIP 
Extensions) does explicitly mention IANA and section 9.11 (Event 
Package) mentions "event packages that are registered", but does 
not mention IANA.

16) Page 46: Should [/ ""' /] be [/ "'" /] in the BNF for 
"ftag-name"?

What=A0I understood is UAS reply back with 200 OK only after all the
necessay steps have been taken against that registration request.

=A0

I feel this can happen only when you send a REGISTER request to
multicast server (not in case of Unicast servers) .

In that case the 1st final response will be considered and later ones
will be discardeed.

Hi all,


I have a problem considering Registration while I' m working with Cisco

Bob,

Section 6.1 points out that feature tags from any of the various trees 
defined in RFC 2506 may be used. Some of those require registration, but 
not all of them.

Perhaps section 9 should be saying that new base-tags may be registered 
with IANA. Or maybe this is adequately covered elsewhere and nothing 
need be said about it here.

Here is the beginning of my review of draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-08.txt.
Adam and Cullen's approach of separating major issues in SIMPLE seemed
to work well, so I will follow the same approach here. This email talks
about nits and typos. I will send a separate note for each issue that I
think might warrant discussion.

------------------------------------

 
Inclusion of summary of feature tag concepts: While I appreciate this
convenience, it always worries me to copy or summarize
normative text from another document. In the event of a conflict between this summary
and the referenced text, who wins? Surely it is the referenced text--but implementers may
attempt to implement this without reading that text. (It is bad enough when people
try to implement examples rather than specification)

6.1p4: 

6.1 Register Example: The example is inconsistent on whether a boolean tag has an explicit "true/false"
value, or simple exists. I do not understand the semantic difference between the two syntaxes.

7.4p8 - missing word: ...predicate [in] the contact's matching set.

7.4p8&9 (and surrounding) - This is pretty hard to digest. Listing it stepwise might help.

7.4p15 : s/prefentially/preferentially

12p3: So, if I do a query register, would I expect to get back the feature sets contained in any
registered contacts? If so, then worrying about protecting it in the original request does not seem
particularly useful.

16 ref 3: Is this really a normative reference? Also, no author listing.

The use of a Require header tag does not seem to buy us much. In a
REGISTER request, the best you can expect is the registrar knows to
store the feature set parameters with the Contact. You cannot assume
that each proxy that uses the registrar's location service knows about
the "prefs" tag just because the registrar did. Also, the registrar
cannot be expected to know the capabilities of every proxy that might
possible use its location service.

I think it would be better to dispense with the Require tag completely,
and just assert that the UA cannot assume that feature parameters will
be honored in any way. This seems to fit with the concept that a proxy
can override any of this due to local policy anyway.

If we do keep the tag, then we need to explicitly document its limited
scope.

The draft does not seem clear on how caller preferences affect
mid-dialog requests. I expected when reading this that caller
preferences would only apply to requests outside an existing dialog, and
that normal dialog routing would prevail for mid-dialog requests.

However, the statements about putting feature set parameters into the
Contact header when a mid-dialog request retargets the remote Contact
confuses that point for me. I am uncertain what use cases there might be
for that feature. The only thing I can think of is to convey information
to the opposite UA that it might use when re-inviting or establishing a
new dialog. But I don't think that usage really fits the scope or
purpose of this draft.

The treatment of implicit vs. explicit preferences worries me. If I
understand correctly, if an Accept-Contact header field exists, then
implicit preferences are ignored. Further, the header field should
contain entries matching the implicit preferences.

It seems dangerously error prone to have this sort of information appear
in two different places in a request. To use the method as an example, I
can game the system by putting methods values that do not match the
actual method of my request.

My first inclination was to say that things like methods and events
should not show up at _all_ in Accept-Contacts. But I realize there may
be cases where I want to send an INVITE request to a UA that also
accepts SUBSCRIBE, so I would put both INVITE and SUBSCRIBE in a methods
parameter in Accept-Contacts.

I think the correct answer, at least for methods and event tags, is to
have the actual method or event tag treated by proxies as if it were
explicitly added to the Accept-Contacts header even if it were not. I
suspect this is true for _any_ parameter that can conflict with
information elsewhere in the request.

It is simply that '="TRUE"' is the default value if none is provided. It 
provides a bit of conciseness for a common case. Maybe some explanatory 
text is in order, somewhere.

Even query registers can (and probably should) be access controlled. So 
protecting still makes sense to me.

I don't think this is the intended interpretation. If an a-c exists but 
doesn't contain a feature tag for th implicit feature, then one gets 
added. If a feature tag already exists for that feature, then it gets 
left along.

Of couse that still makes it possible to do something dumb, but you have 
to be pretty overt about it. For instance, you could send an INVITE, but 
accept contacts that support only SUBSCRIBE. In that case I think you 
get what you deserve.

Need to look at the mechanics of forming the proper expression to do 
this. The explanation might be pretty ugly.

"If, and only if, the proxy did not find any explicit preferences in the
request (because there was no Accept-Contact or Reject-Contact header
field), the proxy extracts implicit preferences."

This wording seems pretty all or nothing.

I can imagine the caller doing this on purpose as an intentional
circumvention of callee policy.

The draft states that if a UAS has registered multiple contacts with
different feature sets, and receives a request to one of those contacts
where the preferences do not match, it should either internally retarget
the request to a contact that _does_ match, or reject the request.

I don't think the _standard_ should make the UAS into a caller prefs
enforcement point. UAS normally should simply handle the request as
normal, without regard to any caller preferences related header. If the
UAS is happy with the nature of the request, then so be it. If not, it
should reject the request based on the normal SIP mechanism for the
particular problem. At most, I would say the UAS MAY enforce caller
prefs, as a matter of local policy.

I also did a detailed review of draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-08.txt and beyond
some of the points already made by Ben and Bob, I had the following
additional minor NITs/Editorial comments.  There also a couple of  points
that I'll put in separate threads as they could invoke some additional
discussion.  Also, I did try to avoid duplicating comments made by Ben and
Bob and apologize if I have inadvertently duplicated anything.

Footing: 
- there is no "." in the "et" of the phrase "et al."

Section 3, page 7: 
- Feature Preferences: "described" -> "describe" 
- Target Set: "URI" -> "URI(s)"

Section 5: 
- Para 5: "instant of time" -> "instance of time"

Section 7.3:
- Last para: "featuer" -> "feature"

Section 7.4:
- Para 5: I know you have an example further down in section 7.4.1, but I'm
thinking an example after this paragraph might be useful.  I had to read the
last few sentences many several times and I'm still not absolutely certain I
understand it given that the example in 7.4.1 has the "require" flag set.
So, I think another example here (or forward referenced to one in 7.4.1)
would be extremely helpful.  

Section 9.6 Automata: 
- Would IVR be considered here as well?  

Section 9.12 Priority:
- I would suggest changing the definition of "emergency" to "The device
supports calls in the case of an emergency situation" as I think the phrase
"emergency calls" tends to so closely associated with an E911 type of call,
whereas I think this is meant to be in terms of the device being one that
user wants to be the primary contact for personal emergency situations.

Section 9.15 Schemes:
- Example of typical use: "Choosing get" -> "Choosing to get"

Section 9.17 Message Server:
- Is this category intended to also apply to IVR? Or, would IVR just be
considered automata?   

Section 9.18 Is Focus:
- this is just a consistency thing, but it seems that this should just be
"Focus" rather than "isfocus" or 9.17 should be "ismsgserver". 

Section 17 Informative References:
- [27] needs to be updated with the RFC number: RFC 3515

Similar to Ben's comment on the Require header and Bob also raised an issue
on this in his comments, I'm really wondering if Proxy-Require should be
used at all.  Bob suggested the following:
   "A UAC SHOULD NOT include a Proxy-Require header with a
    value of "pref" unless it is reasonably certain that all
    proxies along the path between the UAC and the proxy
    responsible for the domain of Request-URI support the
    "pref" extension."

But, my view is that if the UAC is reasonably certain that all proxies
support the extension, why bother with the Proxy-Require?  As the text
currently in the draft suggests, using Proxy-Require introduces
interoperability problems.  Since this is optional functionality, it just
doesn't seem reasonable that a Proxy-Require be used at all.

In section 9.9, the mobility tag is described as "indicates whether the
device is fixed, wireless or somewhere in-between", however, there is no
definition for the somewhere in-between.  

So, my initial reaction would be to reword this as "indicates whether the
device is fixed or wireless", but then I got to thinking about what could
have been meant by some in-between and I think there might be some value in
defining some of those now.  

One term I had considered was "nomadic" as the "in-between".  But, then I
also got to thinking that perhaps "WiFi" is a good example of the
"in-between".  The usefulness of these really depends upon how they
would/could be used.  The one example I saw in the usecases draft was around
wanting to contact someone only on their mobile phone.  The inverse of this
could be that you absolutely don't want to contact them on their mobile
phone, but would want to contact them on anything else or perhaps only if
they're "fixed" or "WiFi". "Nomadic" might be useful for scenarios whereby
one's network connectivity is via tunneling, thus it's indicative not being
reachable at the "fixed" device (eg. the hard SIP client), but you are
available on your soft SIP client working from home.   I haven't thought
this all the way through, but I do think additional terms could be extremely
useful.

My brain is getting fuzzy on this. I'm pretty sure it used to be the 
other way. I have a vague recollection of discussing this with Jonathan, 
but don't recall why this change was made. We'll have to wait for an 
explanation from him.

Callerprefs  aren't a good way for the callee to impose mandatory 
policies - they are a way for a callee to facilitate a caller guiding a 
choice. If the callee wants to enforce this, then he should use some 
other mechanism, like CPL.

I've always had trouble with the semantics of this feature. All the 
examples I can think of for using it really depend of coincidental 
association between mobility and other features.

For instance, *why* would I prefer to call someone on their fixed phone 
rather than their mobile phone?

- because use of the mobile phone is expensive?

- because I know the fixed phone is in a particular location
   and I only want to reach them if they are there.

Neither of these are really directly related to the fixed nature of the 
phone.

I think I asked Jonathan about this and he felt it should be kept 
because it had been around for a long time and we didn't have 
justification for removing it. Personally I think it could just go away.

I think this is useful. Yes, having something like "don't call if it 
costs extra" or "don't call if the person is in a car or meeting" would 
be better, but until everybody uses RPIDS, 'no mobile phone' is a pretty 
good approximation and actually implementable. (In European countries, 
the *caller* pays more for mobile calls, so this is a real concern. And 
mobile is indeed the distinction that matters, not something else.)

Inserted "a".

OK. I added a discussion of this in Section 6.1. Here is the paragraph 
(apologies for the embedded latex commands):

A UA MAY use any feature tags that are registered through IANA in the
IETF or global trees \citenorm{rfc2506}; this document registers
several that are appropriate for SIP. The feature tags discussed in
this specification are referred to as base tags. While other tags can
be used, in order to identify them as feature parameters (as opposed
to parameters for another SIP extension) they are encoded with a
leading ``+'' sign in the Contact header field. See Section
\ref{sec:mapping} for details. It is also permissible to use
the URI tree
\citenorm{rfc2506} for expressing vendor-specific feature
tags. Feature tags in any other trees created through IANA MAY also be
used.

I agree that the current wording is inconsistent, but your proposed 
text, as Mary points out in her email, defeats the purpose of 
Proxy-Require.

I think its reasonable to continue to allow PRoxy-Require. The nice 
thing abuot caller preferences is that, should the request fail becuase 
its not supported somewhere along the path, the fallback is really easy 
- just remove the Proxy-Require. So, it can basically serve as a way for 
a UA to determine whether or not its request will be processed.

I can also imagine applications where a user will want to be certain its 
call routing request will be honored, and if not, attempt to do 
something else. As an example, if I want to make sure a call is routed 
to a user's business line at 3am (to leave a message), and NOT to his 
home line, I might want to use Proxy-Require in this case.

So, I suggest this wording:

> If the UAC wants to be sure that servers understand the header fields

> field with a value of ``pref''. However, this is NOT RECOMMENDED, as

this eliminates the strength ambiguity.

Good point.

Moving the constraints text prior to 6.1 will disrupt the flow of the 
section, I think. I prefer to put that text as section 6.6, and include 
a forward reference. Also, I do not believe that the 3rd paragraph on 
page 13 is a shared constraint. It is specific to registrations.

Also, I found four references to the constraints of 6.1. All have been 
changed to reference the new 6.6.

Removed.

I added an Accept-Contact example.

Added a reference in the first paragraph to 8.2 and 10.

It means, its not supposed to muck with things that are already there.

Its a section numbering problem. They should all fall within 7.2. Good 
catch.

The require flag is used twice. If a contact doesnt match, and there was 
a require tag, the contact is dropped. Then, if it does match, as part 
of the score computation, its looked at again.

Careful here. "r" means read, not remove. From RFC 3261:

The "proxy" column describes the operations a proxy may perform on a
    header field:

       a: A proxy can add or concatenate the header field if not present.

       m: A proxy can modify an existing header field value.

       d: A proxy can delete a header field value.

       r: A proxy must be able to read the header field, and thus this
            header field cannot be encrypted.

So, "ar" means that the proxy needs to be able to read it, and can add a 
value.

As Paul points out, IANA registration is not required for media feature 
tags in the URI tree. I suspect SHOULD is the appropriate term above. 
Interoperability requires a registration, but there are cases, such as 
lab, where its not needed.

Wow, good catch. Thats a very subtle point in RFC2506 that I had missed. 
You've clearly been reading closely. Note also that 9.15 should 
reference the IANA schemes registry. This allows me to remove the 
enumerated listing of the current methods, event types, extensions, and 
schemes, which will always be out of date. Nice.

Yes. This appears to be a bug in my latex converter (my new I-Ds since 
Dec 02 have been using xml2rfc, which I highly recommend).

Thanks for your careful review and comments,

Jonathan R.

On the other hand, people have complained to me that the spec is
incomprehensible without some kind of background, and rfc2533 itself is
too long and complex, and too far outside of the sip universe, to be
easily digestable by a sip implementor. I would rather that the caller
prefs spec be understandable. I'll add a note that says in the event of
conflict, rfc2533 wins of course. The intro to the tutorial now reads:

I'm confused. Section 6.1 paragraph 4 has nothing to do with boolean 
tags. Its talking about the absence of feature tags entirely, not the 
absence of a VALUE for a feature tag.

Fixed.

Its the standard issue of writing text which is effectively trying to 
convey what is ideally described using code. I don't think listing the 
steps in a bullet form as opposed to sentences will really help.

Paul replied to this:

I agree with him. I dont see why protecting it is useless. Sure, you 
need to protect the writes too, but just because someone else does the 
writes doesnt mean you shouldnt protect the reads.

It was part of the registry listing for methods. Per Bob P.'s comments, 
I was able to remove the listing of existing methods and instead 
reference the IANA registry. Thus, the referece to the MESSAGE spec is gone.

Thanks for the comments!

Yes, this did change during the evolution of the draft.

We even had a thread on the sip list on this, as I recall. The problem 
was that the network simply cannot accurately determine the user intent 
when the user includes caller preferences. There are several ways one 
might attempt to include implicit preferences into a request that 
already has explicit preferences. You could add a new term in each 
existing conjunction, or you can add a new predicate entirely. What I 
found was that sometimes one was the right thing, and other times, the 
other. It depended on what the user was trying to accomplish. But, the 
proxy cant know what the user was trying to accomplish.

Since implicit preferences were really meant to cover the case where the 
caller didnt support them, I changed the spec to only have proxies 
compute implicit preferences when there were no explicit ones. I then 
added text recommending that a UAC place explicit prefrences for methods 
and event packages.

So, I feel that the current behavior is the right thing.

I don't really see the danger here. It definitely makes sense for the 
Accept-Contact to list methods beyond the one for the request iself, so 
we've already decoupled the two. The spec recommends that you do include 
the method of the request in the listing:

> A UAC can express explicit preferences for the methods and event
>    packages supported by a UA. It is RECOMMENDED that a UA include a
>    term in an Accept-Contact feature set with the "methods" feature tag,
>    whose value includes the method of the request.


This is at SHOULD/RECOMMENDED strength. I think thats right. Nothing 
breaks if you don't include it. You just may get a 405. Maybe that was 
the intent, in which case, your request was properly formulated. So, 
SHOULD is the right strength - do this unless you have a compelling 
reason otherwise.

Right. Section 4 says this:

    Both request handling and feature preferences can appear in any
    request, not just INVITE. However, they are only useful in requests
    where proxies need to determine a request target. If the domain in
    the request URI is not owned by any proxies along the request path,
    those proxies will never access a location service, and therefore,
    never have the opportunity to apply the caller preferences. This
    makes sense; typically, the request URI will identify a UAS for mid-
    dialog requests. In those cases, the routing decisions were already
    made on the initial request, and it makes no sense to redo them for
    subsequent requests in the dialog.

This is repeated in the section on proxy processing, which says that you 
only use caller prefs when you are the owner of the domain in the r-uri, 
and therefore, accessing a location service. That rules out mid-dialog 
requests.

>

Thats a different application of the parameters. Thats a declaration of 
capabilities, not a request for routing preferences.

One important use case is conferencing. When you end up in an ad-hoc 
conference, the UA becomes a focus, and thus needs to do a re-invite to 
update its contact to include the isfocus parameter.

Thats a good point. The model I had in my head was of the registrar and 
proxy being co-located, but you are right that need not be the case. 
However, practically speaking, I would expect these to be either the 
same, or made by the same vendor, in which case the assumption usually 
will hold.

There is a difference between not understanding the request, and 
understadning it, but denying it because of policy reasons.

My inclination is to keep it, and document the scope. The text now reads:

The REGISTER request MAY contain a Require
header field with the value  ``pref'' if the client wants to be sure
that the registrar understands the extensions
defined in this specification. This means that the registrar will
store the caller preferences parameters, and make them available to
proxies accessing the location service within the domain. In absence of
the Require header field, a registrar that does not understand this 
extension
will simply ignore the Contact header field parameters. Note that even
if the registrar supports caller preferences, it does not mean that
all proxies in the domain which access the location service will
understand caller preferences. Therefore, the client cannot obtain a
guarantee that its preferences are taken into account.

The problem is that we NEED this capability for some of the assisted 
transfer cases to work. Thats why the UA processing was added in the 
first place.

Well, practically speaking, people tell me all the time to "call me on 
my mobile". Caller preferences would allow me to do that without needing 
to have two numbers for that person.

Now, addressing Mary's main point, about adding other definitions for 
mobility. I don't want this to be a technology definition - i.e., 3g 
being different than 2g being different that WiFi. I think the essential 
aspect of it is whether there is a fixed poitn of attachment to the 
network or not As such, it is my preference to just remove the "in 
between" bit. Here is the new text:

\item[Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag:] The
mobility feature tag indicates whether the device is fixed (meaning
that it is associated with a fixed point of contact with the network),
or mobile (meaning that it is not associated with a fixed point of
contact). Note that cordless phones are fixed, not mobile, based on
this definition.

I think I agree with Paul on this one.

Unless someone comes up with a single set of semantics of what it means, it should go away.

What makes it useless is that the explanation below gives two, possibly mutually incompatible, semantics for the same parameter.

I would also point out that the charging characteristics (in Europe) for mobile and fixed line calls are so completely different that it is difficult to conclude on the basis of a single call whether one is cheaper or not. Yes, roaming will maked the roaming user (who could either be calling or called) incur call charges, but the roaming user makes a personal choice to turn their phone on when they are roaming. And the bulk of subscribers making lots of calls are not roaming.

Hi, 

I have a query about request forwarding in proxies...

16.6 Request Forwarding
      2. Request-URI

         The Request-URI in the copy's start line MUST be replaced with
         the URI for this target.  If the URI contains any parameters
         not allowed in a Request-URI, they MUST be removed.

This section says the request URI will be updated fir each request sent out by the proxy. 

What I understood is that it must be same if it is 3261 compliant proxy and the route set received has teh lr parameter also. The statement is correct with respect to strict routing( rfc2543 ) where as rfc3261 make use the loose routing...

Regards,
-Nataraju A.B.

I think there is still some value in just keeping it at "Fixed" and "Mobile"
(per my initial reaction that the "or somewhere in between" needed to be
deleted).  My original posting had been to perhaps expand, but I've been
thinking about that further and clearly there is no compelling reason.  

I think it is still useful for the specific context whereby I as a caller
don't want my calls to go to people's mobiles (even if they do want them to)
OR I only want to go to their mobile or fixed contacts.  Given the current
24/7 reachability empowered by SIP, I think this is useful functionality.  I
also think this is useful given that it's difficult to attach a "personal"
vs. "business" association to mobiles, since most folks use them for both.
Now, this is all predicated on folks registering their contacts with these
tags, but I know that for our system we have implemented the "mobile" tag
and do find it useful. 

Mary.

I think I agree with Paul on this one.

Unless someone comes up with a single set of semantics of what it means, it
should go away.

What makes it useless is that the explanation below gives two, possibly
mutually incompatible, semantics for the same parameter.

I would also point out that the charging characteristics (in Europe) for
mobile and fixed line calls are so completely different that it is difficult
to conclude on the basis of a single call whether one is cheaper or not.
Yes, roaming will maked the roaming user (who could either be calling or
called) incur call charges, but the roaming user makes a personal choice to
turn their phone on when they are roaming. And the bulk of subscribers
making lots of calls are not roaming.

Per my response to Keith's posting, I agree with this proposal (retracting
my suggestion to add other definitions).

Well, practically speaking, people tell me all the time to "call me on 
my mobile". Caller preferences would allow me to do that without needing 
to have two numbers for that person.

Now, addressing Mary's main point, about adding other definitions for 
mobility. I don't want this to be a technology definition - i.e., 3g 
being different than 2g being different that WiFi. I think the essential 
aspect of it is whether there is a fixed poitn of attachment to the 
network or not As such, it is my preference to just remove the "in 
between" bit. Here is the new text:

\item[Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag:] The
mobility feature tag indicates whether the device is fixed (meaning
that it is associated with a fixed point of contact with the network),
or mobile (meaning that it is not associated with a fixed point of
contact). Note that cordless phones are fixed, not mobile, based on
this definition.

Hi all,

	Just wondering if anyone knows of a document/s which trace the development
of SIP from its initial conception to its current state of
development-including first authors, dates etc..  Any input would be greatly
appreciated!

Cheers,

Ok, here are my comments on the P-header for osp-tokens. If anybody else has
something to say, please say it soon.



Draft Section 1, P4 says:
-------
   We propose to use existing IETF protocols and proposals in Internet 
   Drafts for interdomain IP telephony calls with QoS as a first step 
   toward a uniform AAA approach. The approach outlined here may be 
   useful later for developing a uniform AAA architecture and protocols 
   for other application layer services. 
---------

<dean> Don't "propose", document  . . . . Perhaps "This draft documents a
propietary SIP extension header field that may be used to exchange open
settlement protocol [4] information in the context of a SIP session
establishment." </dean>

                  Figure 1:   Model for interdomain QoS phone call 
------------------

<dean> What the heck is an "RSVP tunnel"? Is this something like a GRE
tunnel between two edge routers which run RSVP such that it doesn't require
RSVP support in the routers traversed by that tunnel? Is this usage
documented somewhere, and if so, can you please give a reference in the
references section? Speaking of which, do we need to informatively reference
RSVP in this spec?</dean>

    
Draft, Section 3, Para 3 says:
------------------------------
   For these reasons, a new SIP header is proposed instead of a new MIME 
   type for OSP authorization tokens. 
------------------------------
<dean>  s/header/header field/ -- repeat in several places throughout doc
</dean>


Draft, Section 4, P 3 says:
---------------------------
   which the header filed can be used
---------------------------
<dean> s/filed/field/ </dean>


Draft, Section 5 says:
----------------------
5.   Protocol Semantics 
    
   The OSP Token is always encoded per base64 and only allowed in INVITE 
   requests and 200 OK responses to INVITEs. 
----------------------

<dean> Is there any implication for early media?  Oh no, I said Early Media!
Make the Pain Stop!</dean>


Draft Section 5.1 says:
-----------------------
5.1    User Agents 
    
   A UAC MAY include the header an INVITE requesting QoS using AAA. 
-----------------------
<dean> s/header/header field/ </dean>

Draft, Section 6 says:
----------------------
6.   Example Message 
    
   This SIP INVITE message is an example exchange between the two 
   domains as shown in Figure 1:

------------------------------

<dean? The domain usage should align with RFC26206, aka "example.com"
</dean>


The draft's IANA considerations section says:
---------------------------------------------
IANA Considerations 
    
   Registration of "P-OSP-Auth-Token" SIP header field 
    
   This document defines a new private SIP header field, "P-OSP-Auth-
   Token".  As recommended by the policy of the Transport Area [3], this 
   header should be registered by the IANA in the SIP header registry, 
   using the RFC number of this document as its reference. 
    
    Name of Header:          P-OSP-Auth-Token 
    
    Short form:              None 
    
    Registrant:              Alan Johnston

                             alan.johnston@wcom.com 
    
    Normative description:   This document 
---------------------------------------------

<dean> The reference given, [3], is a reference to Cryptographic Message
Syntax. I think this is not what you want to point to. You probably need a
reference to RFC3427, the SIP Change Process, which augments the RFC361 IANA
process to account for P-headers.  Editorially, it would be nice to see the
IANA Considerations section numbered and listed in the ToC.</dean>


The draft's security considerations section says:
-------------------------------------------------
Security Considerations 
    
   The security and handling of OSP tokens is covered in [4] which 
   includes encryption and the use of IPSec.  
    
   The P-OSP-Auth-Token header field may be protected using standard SIP 
   mechanisms such as TLS transport and/or S/MIME encryption as detailed 
   in [1]. 
--------------------------------------------------

<dean> This is, well, a little light. It would be nice to see some
discussion of exactly how the threat model in [4] is exposed by carrying OSP
in SIP, and have a little more discussion of how the referenced security
mechanisms protect from those exposures. </dean>

Hi,
According to RFC3261, the dialog ID just include Call-id, remote tag and local tag. So, the local uri, remote uri and remote target uri are not used for dialog matching. 
After one dialog established, can a UA change his own local uri, remote uri and remote target uri?  Or, can the UA send a re-INVITE with different From-URI, To-URI and Request-URI as original INVITE's ?
I think it is permitted in RFC3261. But i am not sure.

Thanks
Kevin

Hi,

You must not change the To-URI and From-URI. It is true that in RFC3261
they aren't used for the dialog id, and not for the transaction id, but
in RFC2543 they WERE used for this kind of purpose, so at least for
backward compability (I guess there may be other reasons too...) you
shall not change them.

Folks,

Despite the great feedback we've gotten from the group on the caller 
preferences draft lately, there appear to still be some pretty 
fundamental issues that have come up in discussions with some of our 
area directors. In particular, our q-value arithmetic operations have 
serious issues. Since q-values are meant to be ordinal in nature, not 
cardinal, any kind of arithmetic you might perform on them won't work. 
You also can't compare q-values received from disparate sources, which 
is another thing the draft is sort-of doing (it actually punts this to 
domain policy, but there is no policy that will work properly).

The authors of the draft have some ideas on how to fix this. Our current 
thinking is to eliminate the caller q-values (i.e., no q-values in the 
Accept-Contact header field), and use the score as a way to order the 
contacts ONLY for those contacts whose q-value (specified by the callee) 
is identical. Its not clear that this will work well enough for us, or 
whether there are more q-value issues lurking there. As such, it looks 
like there will be significant additional delays as we work these issues 
and discuss them with ADs.

The problem is that there are now several drafts with normative 
dependencies on caller preferences, including the SIMPLE specification. 
As it turns out, nearly all of these only need the registration piece of 
caller preferences, not the call routing and proxy matching pieces. In 
order to avoid dragging all of those specifications down by caller 
preferences, our proposal is to split caller preferences in half. One 
draft will focus only on capabilities. It will define the contact 
parameters, show how to use them in REGISTER (and also in the INVITE/200 
OK contact and OPTIONS), and describe the rfc2533 mapping. This draft is 
uncontroversial and can proceed immmediately. The other draft will allow 
for caller preferences. It will define the Accept-Contact and 
Reject-Contact header fields, and will describe the proxy matching 
algorithm. We will need to continue to think about how to make that work 
in a reasonable fashion.

The chairs and spec co-authors believe this is the best course of 
action. So, please speak up if you have problems with this tactic, since 
we will move in this direction unless we hear otherwise.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Hi, all 

  I have a question about SIP service : HOLD

  In draft sipping-service-examples-04, the example "Call Hold" in P9, I 
think the "hold" infomation is expressed in SDP (Message F10):
  <quote>
  v=0
  o=bob 2890844527 2890844528 IN IP4 client.biloxi.example.com
  s=Session SDP
  c=IN IP4 client.biloxi.example.com
  t=3034423619 0
  m=audio 3456 RTP/AVP 0
  a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
  a=sendonly
  ~~~~~~~~~~ <----- here I think express the infomation : " HOLD "
  </quote>
 

  In our lab, there is a Cisco SIP phone - 7940G.
  I catch the messages from Cisco's SIP phone when press "Hold" key , it 
fullfils "Call Hold" like this way:
  <quote_cisco>
  v=0
  o=Cisco-SIPUA 7825 13012 IN IP4 10.10.3.117
  s=SIP Call
  c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0
           ~~~~~~~ <---- here, Cisco using "0.0.0.0" to express "HOLD"
  t=0 0
  m=audio 28036 RTP/AVP 18 0 8 96
  a=rtpmap:18 G729/8000
  a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
  a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000
  a=rtpmap:96 telephone-event/8000
  a=fmtp:96 0-15
 </quote_cisco> 

 First, I do not find any statements about "0.0.0.0" can express "HOLD" in 
RFC2327(SDP). Who can tell me where can I find the relative drafts talking 
about "0.0.0.0" ?
 Second, I really do not know which is the criteria ? Cisco's SIP phone is 
right or I do according to sipping-service-example-04 ? 

 Thanks a lot to give some advice ;)

Here are my comments to the latest SIP MIB I-D. I have divided them into =
three categories - design and architecture, MIB and SMI, and editorials =
and formatting. Concerning the latest category, I did not go yet into a =
detailed search for all editorial nits, as the current version has more =
important issue to solve and will need more iterations anyway.

Regards,

Dan

-------------------------------------------------------------

A - Design and Architecture Issues

A1 - Although the declared goal of this version was to align the MIB =
with the evolution of SIP from RFC 2543 to RFC 3261, this evolution was =
not completed. A large part of the MIB is still referring to RFC 2543. =
Moreover, in the absence of an explicit note in the text, the =
implementer of the current version of this MIB risks to work with a =
hybrid that may cause problems.
A2 - One of the issues future implementers of this MIB will deal with is =
the issue of extensibility. How new methods that may be added to SIP in =
the future will be accommodated. The authors chose the path to support =
RFC 3261 and the INFO method defined in RFC 2976, as a basic common =
package, and defined an extensibility mechanism for the rest. This can =
work - with some problems defined later - but there is a need to explain =
this and maybe provide some examples in the introductory sessions.
A3 - Section 4, page 4, last paragraph. As far as I understand the =
position this document takes is that' if a device has more than one SIP =
entity, or multiple instances of the same entity, it MUST implement =
multiple SIP modules' - so MUST and not SHOULD.
A4 - Section 4.2, page 4 - need to define the way sipServiceOperStatus =
maps into applOperStatus
A5 - sipFtrSupportedtable - I am questioning if these table design is =
correct. Are the features similar (identically supported) for a multiple =
entity (like a proxy and a registrar) which would generate just one row =
in this table
A6 - sipExtMethodSupportedTable - It is not clear why this table is not =
the common key for all ExtMethod tables in the MIB. =
sipExtmethodSupportedIndex could be index for =
sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable, sipCommonCfgRetryExtnMethodTable, =
sipStatsExtMethodTable, sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodTable. Beyond =
providing a common index for extended methods to be used by =
applications, this would avoid defining again name objects in each of =
these tables
A7 - it is not clear why sipCommonStatusCodeNotifyTable is defined as a =
separate table, and not part of sipCommonStatusCideTable? Was the =
intention to say that if the table (which is optional) is not =
implemented, there are no notifications at all? If this is the case, =
this should be explicitly described
A8 - if the result of setting sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode to =
'normal' is one notification for each SIP response message, is not it =
more safe to define the DEFVAL for this object something else than =
'normal'?
A9 - How does an application receiving a =
sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif know that the notification applies for =
codeIns or for codeOuts? Maybe it's better to define two distinct =
notifications
A10 - Implementing this MIB has strong security implications. This MIB =
has a large number of read-write objects, including the servers, =
presents security mode objects, and transaction tables with client =
information. All this needs to be detailed in the Security =
Considerations section, including the explicit lists of all read-write =
and security sensitive objects (even if not read-write), and the =
specific security risks that derive from having this objects exposed =
through a MIB interface



B - MIB and SMI Issues

B1 - There is no reference in the document to the persistence properties =
of the defined objects. It is RECOMMENDED that the DESCRIPTION clauses =
specify what happens to the value after an agent reboot. Among the =
possibilities are that the value remains unchanged, that it reverts to a =
well-defined default value, or that the result is =
implementation-dependent
B2 - sipServiceOperStatus - it would be better to define unknown as the =
first value in the enumeration
B3 - same - a REFERENCE clause for the operStatus values would help
B4 - sipExtMethodName - need to define rules for the method names - e.g. =
string 'REFER' for the REFER method, etc.
B5 - sipCfgRetryExtMethodStatus - what does the last phrase in the =
DESCRIPTION clause mean ('If that method already exists for a particular =
applIndex, the row create operation will fail'). How are values in a row =
changed?=20
B6 - The behavior of the counters in the tables sipStatsExtMethodTable =
and sipCommonStatusCodeTable are inconsistent. For the later, if the =
RowStatus object is set to 'notInService' counters MAY be reset, while =
for the former they interrupt counts and re-start from the same place. =
Ambiguous behavior is strongly discouraged, and in any case a counter =
discontinuity object must be added to mark the timestamp of the last =
reset of the counters in the row
B7 - from the semantics of sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode, one derives =
that sipCommonStatusCodeNotifSend needs to be true at the time this =
object is set. Does this mean that a typical sequence of row creation in =
this table involves needs to be a two step process?
B8 - There is no reason to define sipTransActivityInfo as a =
concatenation of two objects, each with a different semantics. I suggest =
braking this object into two objects with direction and request/response =
semantics
B9 - If only a subset of the values of a TC is supported, like in the =
case of sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus, this needs to be reflected in the =
compliance clauses. See Section 4.8 of =
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ops-mib-review-guidelines-=
01.txt for an example
B10 - why the requirement to provide a varbind for sipUACfgSipServerAddr =
object in the same set operation that sets a sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus =
to 'createAndGo'? Cannot the object have been set previously?=20
B11 - sipServerHostAddress - as a subset of InetAddress TC is used, this =
needs to be reflected in the compliance clauses. What is the reason to =
limit the size to 254, while the InetAddress TC in RFC 3291 allows for a =
size of 255?
B12 - why is sipContactPreference coded as a string, and not as a sized =
integer? I actually do not see preference in section 6.13 of RFC 2543 as =
indicated by the REFERENCE clause, but from the DESCRIPTION it looks =
like it could be coded as number 1 to 99.

C - Editorial and formatting issues

C1 - Proxy Servers, Redirect Servers, etc. are capitalized in an =
inconsistent manner, starting with the very visible Abstract section
C2 - The key words rule - though mentioned in the Introduction section =
is not followed in much of the document. I strongly suggest that the =
authors make a search through the document for all key words, and use =
capitals wherever it applies, including the DESCRIPTION clauses of the =
MIB objects
C3 - RFC 2119 should be in the normative references category
C4 - Section 4 - Structure of the MIB should list the MIB groups, and =
not the conformance groups. I strongly recommend to add a short =
explanation for each one of the MIB groups functionality
C5 - SIP is inconsistently spelled in the document. While in the =
majority of places it is "SIP", in a few you may find "sip" (e.g. =
Section 4, page 4, last paragraph, where both variants may be found in =
the same phrase)
C6 - Section 4.2 should rather be named 'Relationship to the Network =
Services MIB'.
C7 - Section 4.2, page 4 - applVersion - why the if here? Can something =
else than SIP version be used? I think not
C8 - Replace in the CONTACT-INFO clauses 'SIP MIB email' by SIP WG =
e-mail
C9 - Insert notes to the RFC editor after the DESCRIPTION clauses of the =
MIB to remind that RFC number and OID assignment need to be provided, =
and the notes removed prior to publication
C10 - page 11 - It would help if a short commented explanation would be =
added for each MIB group like sipCommionCfgBase, sipCommonCfgTimer, etc=20
C11 - DESCRIPTION clause of sipOrganization - typo it is probably =
'string' and not 'sting'
C12 - DESCRIPTION clause of sipPortStatus - I am not sure what is the =
intent of the word 'remotely'. I suggest to take it out from here and =
other similar RowStatus objects definition
C13 - same - It should be 'The rows associated...' (plural) as there =
might be one row for each applIndex value
C14 - RFC 2396 and RFC 2368 mentioned in the DESCRIPTION clause of =
sipUriSupportedTable need to be added to the reference clauses
C15 - sipCfgTimerC - delete the last phrase in the DESCRIPTION clause - =
this is redundant as it can be deduced from the syntax
C16 - add more detailed DESCRIPTION clauses for sipCfgTimerT2, =
sipCfgTimerT4 - consistent with the rest of the DESCRIPTION clauses in =
the same table
C17 - DESCRIPTION clause for sipMethodStatsTable - delete the word =
'per'. This table does not include per method statistics, but method =
statistics per entity
C18 - provide more details in the DESCRIPTION clauses of =
sipStatsRedirCalssIns and sipStatsRedirClassOuts, consistent with other =
DESCRIPTION clauses in the same table
C19 - append at the end of the DESCRIPTION clause of =
sipCurrentTransactions '... corresponding to the entity identified by =
applIndex.'
C20 - delete the last phrase in the DESCRIPTION clause of =
sipStatsRetryExtMethodName
C21 - DESCRIPTION of sipNotifApplIndex - explain that this object (which =
is a duplication of applIndex) is created in order to allow an =
accessible-to-notify object included in the notifications varbind
C22 - change names of sipUACfgSipServerAddrIndex to =
sipUACfgSipServerIndex, and sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus to =
sipUACfgSipServerStatus
C23 - Section 5.4 seems to have formatting problems related tot he =
number of allowed characters in a row
C24 - DESCRIPTION clause of sipProxyAuthMethod - more than one method =
may be used, change the clause to reflect this
C25 - sipRegMaxContactExpiryDate - calling this object ...Date is =
mis-leading. I suggest to rename it to ...Duration or something else.
C26 - The Normative References section is inconsistent, and does not =
comply with the format recommended in =
http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html
C27 - RFC 3291 (INET-MIB) needs to be added to the Normative References =
list

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">Here are my comments to the =
latest SIP MIB I-D. I have divided them into three categories - design =
and architecture, MIB and SMI, and editorials and formatting. Concerning =
the latest category, I did not go yet into a detailed search for all =
editorial nits, as the current version has more important issue to solve =
and will need more iterations anyway.</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">Regards,</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A - Design and Architecture =
Issues</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A1 - Although the declared =
goal of this version was to align the MIB with the evolution of SIP from =
RFC 2543 to RFC 3261, this evolution was not completed. A large part of =
the MIB is still referring to RFC 2543. Moreover, in the absence of an =
explicit note in the text, the implementer of the current version of =
this MIB risks to work with a hybrid that may cause problems.</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A2 - One of the issues future =
implementers of this MIB will deal with is the issue of extensibility. =
How new methods that may be added to SIP in the future will be =
accommodated. The authors chose the path to support RFC 3261 and the =
INFO method defined in RFC 2976, as a basic common package, and defined =
an extensibility mechanism for the rest. This can work - with some =
problems defined later - but there is a need to explain this and maybe =
provide some examples in the introductory sessions.</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A3 - Section 4, page 4, last =
paragraph. As far as I understand the position this document takes is =
that' if a device has more than one SIP entity, or multiple instances of =
the same entity, it MUST implement multiple SIP modules' - so MUST and =
not SHOULD.</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A4 - Section 4.2, page 4 - =
need to define the way sipServiceOperStatus maps into =
applOperStatus</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A5 - sipFtrSupportedtable - I =
am questioning if these table design is correct. Are the features =
similar (identically supported) for a multiple entity (like a proxy and =
a registrar) which would generate just one row in this table</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A6 - =
sipExtMethodSupportedTable - It is not clear why this table is not the =
common key for all ExtMethod tables in the MIB. =
sipExtmethodSupportedIndex could be index for =
sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable, sipCommonCfgRetryExtnMethodTable, =
sipStatsExtMethodTable, sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodTable. Beyond =
providing a common index for extended methods to be used by =
applications, this would avoid defining again name objects in each of =
these tables</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A7 - it is not clear why =
sipCommonStatusCodeNotifyTable is defined as a separate table, and not =
part of sipCommonStatusCideTable? Was the intention to say that if the =
table (which is optional) is not implemented, there are no notifications =
at all? If this is the case, this should be explicitly =
described</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A8 - if the result of setting =
sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode to 'normal' is one notification for =
each SIP response message, is not it more safe to define the DEFVAL for =
this object something else than 'normal'?</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A9 - How does an application =
receiving a sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif know that the notification =
applies for codeIns or for codeOuts? Maybe it's better to define two =
distinct notifications</FONT></P>

<P DIR=3DLTR><FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D"Arial">A10 - Implementing this MIB =
has strong security implications. This MIB has a large number of =
read-write objects, including the servers, presents security mode =
objects, and transaction tables with client information. All this needs =
to be detailed in the Security Considerations section, including the =
explicit lists of all read-write and security sensitive objects (even if =
not read-write), and the specific security risks that derive from having =
this objects exposed through a MIB interface</FONT></P>

I would like make my original question more clear by dividing it into two
parts.

The first part:
"UA can change his local uri and remote uri by himself in mid-dialog.", i
think it is correct in RFC3261.

The second part:
"UA can change his request-uri by himself in mid-dialog."  Maybe we can not
do it.
RFC3261 said,  in mid-dialog, "The UAC uses the remote target and route set
to build the Request-URI".  UA can not change "remote target" and "route
set" by himself in mid-dialog.  So, UA can not change his request-uri by
himself in mid-dialog. The UA can change his request-uri by opposite UA's
instruction.

I ask this question because request-uri can be used as service
identification. If UA can change the request-uri by itself, so UA can use
request-uri to carry different service request during mid-dialog. Maybe we
can use parameters to achieve this target.

Hi All,

	Just wondering if anyone knows where I might find a complete list of the
transport protocols upon which SIP can run?

Cheers,

Hi,

Please refer to the following statement in Sec. 4.2 of RFC 3263.

<snip>

If the TARGET was not a numeric IP address, but a port is present in
the URI, the client performs an A or AAAA record lookup of the domain
name.  The result will be a list of IP addresses, each of which can
be contacted at the specific port from the URI and transport protocol
determined previously.  The client SHOULD try the first record.  If
an attempt should fail, based on the definition of failure in Section
4.3, the next SHOULD be tried, and if that should fail, the next
SHOULD be tried, and so on.


Definition of failure according to Sec. 4.3 is:

For SIP requests, failure occurs if the transaction layer reports a
503 error response or a transport failure of some sort (generally,
due to fatal ICMP errors in UDP or connection failures in TCP).
Failure also occurs if the transaction layer times out without ever
having received any response, provisional or final (i.e., timer B or
timer F in RFC 3261 [1] fires).


I have following questions:

1) Since ACK for 200 response indicates a new transaction and follows 
rules of sec. 4.2 to find out the ip address of next hop element to send 
ACK to, how does the client transaction detect failure for ACK and move 
to next record in the list if used with UDP and the next hop does not 
generate transport errors.

2) For PRACK, if the client transaction layer times out waiting for 200 
OK to PRACK before moving to the next record, the server transaction may 
run out of 18x retries waiting for PRACK and disconnect the call, if the 
next record happens to be the one that sent 18x.

TIA,
Sanjay.

I have an obviously by now outdated piece of history in 
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~jo/presentations/2001-me-sip-short-history.pdf

I also maintain an updated one which I use in seminars but which is not
yet published anywhere (and needs some updating, too).

You will also find a lot of information (presumably including a repository
of SIP drafts) at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip

In RFC 2543 Expires header is defined as "Expires" ":" ( SIP-date | delta-seconds ), whereas in RFC 3261 it is only "Expires" HCOLON delta-seconds.

Will it not create backward compatibility issues if somebody is using SIP-date to specify the expires duration?

Dean,

Thanks for your comments - I'll make the changes suggested.  I'll

[CHH] It is true that the remote server will not be able to send eg a 503
response for an ACK, but if the failure occurs on the transport level you
will be notified it the same way as you would for any other request (ICMP
errors etc). These are sent independently on if the remote server generates
SIP responses or not.

[CHH] In theory, yes. Normally, however, I would say that PRACKs are sent to
the same IP address as the INVITE, so if you don't get a reply (even if you
get replies to the INVITE) something is probably wrong on the remote side
anway...

Also, I would assume that in most cases the remote party either answers the
call, or the client terminates the call setup, before these timeouts
occur...

Polls and comments were taken prior to
removing the backward compatibility.

If I recall correctly, the Contact expires 
parameter of a 200 response to a REGISTER was 
the only location that vendors had previously 
chose to send SIP-date instead of delta-seconds.

Those using SIP-date within Expires and
and various other headers agreed to change
their implementations start sending delta-seconds.

Dear Sirs,

I would like to know which Scenarios you had in mind for the usage of RFC 3325. 

In chapter 1 you state the following:
"An example deployment would be a closed network which emulates a traditional circuit switched telephone network."

Is this the Scenario that motivated you or are the others?

Regards

Roland Glckler

[CHH] Well, if the ACK doesn't reach the server you will get retransmits of the 200 OK (unless they are supposed to be sent from the same interface which has crashed, of course)..

[CHH] True, but what I meant is that the remote UAS (ie the one generating and sending the 18x messages, and that will eventually receive the PRACK) is the same.

UAC             PROXY             UAS

[SS] Right, but how does the client's transaction figure out that 200  
retransmissions are because of Ack going to the wrong interface from the 
list  vs. Ack being lost in the network/network delay and whether it 
should cycle to the next record or not.

[SS] Not neccesarily, if the UAS has dual interface (for redundancy 
etc.) and uses fqdn in contact of 18x with one interface having higher 
priority than the other one and the high priority interface down for 
some reason. UAC, after dns resolution of contact's fqdn, will use it 
for sending Prack and will keep  retransmitting till it gets 200 OK and 
will cycle to the next record when it runs out of retries. But the UAS 
is also retransmitting 18x waiting for Prack since the interface it's 
getting Prack on is down and when it runs out of retries will disconnect 
the call.
