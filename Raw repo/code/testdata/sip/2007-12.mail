Hi Adam,

I believe this comment has been adressed in outbound-11 section 4.4.1:

> If sending over a SigComp [25] compressed data stream, the CRLF  
> keepalives are sent inside the compressed stream.

thanks,

Hi Brian,

I think this is now addressed in outbound-11 with the following  
comment in section 4.2:
> If the registrar did not support outbound, the UA may have  
> unintentionally registered an unroutable contact. It is the  
> responsiblity of the UA to remove any inappropriate Contacts.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Erkki,

I largely used your text for a reworded section 6, except that the  
text deals with the binding rules for GRUU as well as outbound.

I believe all your points are addressed in outbound-11.

more inline.

the outbound spec is supposed to define the new binding behavior for  
both GRUU and outbound-style registrations.

The registrar has to store the URI so the authoritative proxy can  
place the URI in the Request-URI (retarget) when it forwards the  
request. This URI is not used for next hop routing however.

A registrar which supports GRUU MUST also support outbound.  If the  
UA requests outbound, it is highly likely that the GRUU will be  
unusable anyway.

I left this in place as a reminder to implementors. Several  
implementors contacted me privately asking what information the  
registrar needs to store.  With this text, that information is in one  
place.

Hi Erkki,

I believe I have addressed all your comments below except storing the  
time (which is an issue for GRUU). See inline for more.

The registrar could receive from the same UA, one registration  
through a edge proxy that supports outbound, and one that does not.    
(a and b are allowed, but not c).  The case of c) is already  
prohibited by the text in section 4.2.1

the whole request with a 400 Bad Request, since this combination is  
clearly illegal.

As I mentioned in another thread, the time is stored for consistency  
with 3261 and for use with GRUU, but we could change this behavior if  
we update GRUU accordingly.

The Contact URI is still necessary (for retargeting), but your  
sentence is still correct.

Hi Erkki,

I believe your comments have been addressed except for the question  
of which error response to send a registration Requires outbound, but  
the ob parameter is missing from the 1st Path header.  In addition,  
the invalidation of temporary GRUU I have raised as an open issue,  
although the text in -11 will behave nicely with the current GRUU spec.

See inline for more.

thanks,
-rohan

This section was updated based on feedback from the apps area and the  
URI mailing list.  Now it MUST be a URN specifically described for  
use with outbound in an IETF-consensus RFC.  The UUID is the only one  
currently defined. if the IETF defined an IMEI URN for example, that  
spec could allow its use with outbound.

I believe the text now in -11 (sect 4.2 para 4) is appropriate.

This is currently an open issue. One way to resolve this is to say  
that UAs must not include Require: outbound in a REGISTER request. A  
survey of error codes does not give an obvious answer. 420 is clearly

This text was fixed so the UA does not register via EP2 at all.

I have changed the behavior so the Call-IDs do not change, however I  
think this is bad behavior and that the GRUU spec should be changed  
to keep temporary GRUUs as long as a new registration comes form any  
previously used Call-ID.

Hi Kevin,

I think all your comments have been addressed in outbound-11.

more inline.

for UDP, the flow has failed when the STUN request fails (which  
includes timing out after 7.9 secs).  Normal STUN retransmits are  
sent since these are normal STUN requests.

This is covered in sect 8, 9th paragraph.

It is the responsibility of the UA to cleanup any registrations that  
are unwanted.  This includes any registration that had a Path header  
with a flow token that is no longer of interest.  I added this sentence:

good point. I fixed this in section 8.

Hi John,

I think I have addressed all your issues in outbound-11 except as  
noted below.

This "can include" language allows the UA to do non-outbound  
registrations (for example third-party registrations described in  
sect 4.2.1)

I believe the current text clears this up.  The registrar includes  
the instance-id parameter in the response to a register request, but  
that is just a side effect of normal operation.

we've been asked by the ADs to avoid excessive use of normative  
language, so I left the text as is.

we came to some consensus in Montreal to put these in a single  
section.  The section is short enough that I think the requirements  
will be clear enough to implementors.

Jerry, Peter,

Per consenus in Chicago we have ;keep in outbound-11 instead of ;keep- 
stun and ;keep-crlf.  I believe this fix addresses your comments.

Keith,

A comment about one of your points:

DRAGE, Keith (Keith) wrote:

I'm wondering what you have in mind here.

It is possible to send request R1 then send R2 before getting a response 
to R1. And then it is possible for R2 to arrive before R1, and in that 
case it will be accepted. But then, when R1 arrives there will be a CSeq 
error so it will be rejected.

The end result is that you can get *nondelivery* of a message, but not 
*out of order delivery*.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi Sergio,

I believe all your concerns have been addressed in outbound-11,  
except that the example in Section 9 needs to be rewritten.  The keep- 
stun and keep-crlf parameters have been merged into a single 'keep'  
parameter.  A few more comments inline.

thanks,
-rohan

If the next hop from the UA is the registrar, there will be no edge  
proxy and therefore probably no Path header.

the Path header or the Service-Route header for example.  This could  
just be learned through configuration.

This will get fixed when I overhaul the example.

Hi John,

I believe outbound-11 addresses this concern.  The UA is now allowed  
to request flow token handling on a REGISTER or any dialog-forming  
request.

thanks,

Hi Nils,

The example still needs to be overhauled and will address the concern  
you raised.

TCP keepalive references have been removed from the document.  The UA  
can always use TCP keepalives, but the UA cannot know that the next  
hop will respond (this is a ping with no pong).

Hi Derek,

I think I have addressed all your comments except the CRLF backward  
compatibility, which I have fixed in my working copy. See below for  
specifics.

I think this is greatly improved in -11 by the following changes:

outbound-11 now states that the edge proxy is expected to record- 
route with a flow-token if the client includes an 'ob' parameter in  
its Contact.  If the client is using gruu, it uses the gruu instead  
in its contact.  The UA now also uses rport in all requests.

I think this should be sufficient to insure responses (rport),  
incoming requests (from Path flow token in REGISTER), and in-dialog  
requests (from Record-Route flow token, or from a GRUU) all get back  
to the UA.

no and no.  The "typically results in sending the REGISTER..." text  
is there to allow the traditional usage of an outbound proxy, which  
is to resolve the IP address, port, and transport and send it there  
without including a Route header at all.

I think the current text already require that the first element  
visited (whether in the route set or not) is in the outbound-proxy-set.

yes.

this has been changed in -11 to allow flows to be formed for dialog- 
creating requests.

rport is still relevant when flows are used, because outbound does  
not change the rules in 3261 for forwarding responses.

no, the whole parameter should be omitted.  i think i reworded this

bummer.  I forgot to include this in -11.  I have added this in my

The UA can't use time zero, if the UA generates multiple instance-ids  
and uses time zero for all of them.
In the absence of better text, I left it as is.

In outbound-11 I think I have addressed this issue. The UAC can  
include an 'ob' parameter in a dialog-forming request and expect the  
first hop proxy to record route appropriately.  This should allow the  
sip config package subscription to work.

we merged the keep-stun and keep-crlf into a simple 'keep' parameter.
this 'keep' parameter just allows the UAC to know if it will get a  
pong in response to its pings.

it probably could, but it is not clear where it would go in the 200 OK.

what we have may be ugly, but it will work and we appear to have  
consensus on it.

the parameter does not need to be there.  It could instead be in the  
topmost Route header for example.

ob is used for two things:
- inserted in Path by the first edge proxy
- added to Contact by UA to request record-routing

The edge proxy uses the presence of the reg-id in a Contact in a  
REGISTER request to add a Path header with a flow token, and the  
presence of the ob parameter in a Contact in a non-REGISTER request  
to add a Record-Route header with a flow token.

This should just work, but the single UA/proxy would need to return a  
Path header, otherwise the UA would have no way of discovering  
support for keepalive responses.

No.  It was pulled out of thin air.

There was some expectation that the UA would be willing to lose 2  
minutes of phone calls, but 14 minutes would be a lot of time to be  
off the air.  Certainly, the UA can use something short (like 2  
minutes) for one flow, and 14 minutes for any additional flows  
without many ill effects.

I made this more clear in -11.  The base time is either 30 secs or 90  
secs.

this does not work.  receiving some other traffic does not count as a  
pong since it could be very stale data.

Hear, hear!  I toned this rhetoric down a bit.

yeah.

We need to change the base-level behaviour<BR>&gt; &gt; of outbound so NAT traversal just works, is this is a core requirement<BR>&gt; &gt; of outbound.<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; Also:<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; Note that if the UA wants its flow to work through NATs or<BR>&gt; &gt; firewalls it still needs to put the 'rport' parameter [10] in <BR>&gt; &gt; its<BR>&gt; &gt; Via header field value, and send from the port it is prepared to<BR>&gt; &gt; receive on. More general information about NAT traversal in SIP<BR>&gt; &gt; is described in [23].<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; should be removed. [23] is very out of date, and references<BR>&gt; &gt; outbound-01, and I believe some of the text is out of date. Rport is<BR>&gt; &gt; not relevant when flows are used, although it doesn't cause any harm.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; rport is still relevant when flows are used, because outbound does <BR>&gt; not change the rules in 3261 for forwarding responses.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; Questions/minor issues:<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; 4.1:<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; "The value of this parameter MUST be a URN [8].

If<BR>&gt; &gt; so, what does it contain?<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; no, the whole parameter should be omitted. i think i reworded this <BR>&gt; to make it more clear.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; "As a result, the UA instance SHOULD provide lexically equivalent URNs<BR>&gt; &gt; in each registration it<BR>&gt; &gt; generates.

I would reference this section in 3.5.1 and/or<BR>&gt; &gt; 4.4.2.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; bummer. I forgot to include this in -11. I have added this in my <BR>&gt; working copy to section 3.5.1 as follows:<BR>&gt; &gt; Sending a CRLF over a connection-oriented transport is<BR>&gt; &gt; backwards safe (because of requirements in Section 7.5 of <BR>&gt; &gt; RFC 3261),<BR>&gt; &gt; but only implementations which support the 'keep' <BR>&gt; &gt; parameter will<BR>&gt; &gt; respond to a "ping" with a "pong".<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; 2.1<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; "reg-id: This refers to the value of a new header field parameter<BR>&gt; &gt; value for the Contact header field.

I'm sure not everyone agrees with this

I have no problems writing this into the doc, if this is agreeable. 
Should something like, "and a LbyR URI (MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT) to be 
dereferenced"

Ted's tone doesn't indicate this is "just a hint", he's making this 
seem like a mandatory prevention mechanism.  That I think is a fool's 
errand, and it is not enforceable in cleartext.

That said, "hinting" that proxies SHOULD NOT view location when 
"recipient=endpoint" is not a problem.  What I am resisting, is that 
UA's don't know if a message might need location to route the message 
to the endpoint. Contacting a UAS, like Pizza Hut, might need 
location to route the message to the nearest store, the user might 
know this, but the UA might not. This would result in a rejection of 
the initial message (because location isn't readable by a proxy that 
needs the location-info). Would the UA understand that the rejection 
means sent "recipient=both" in a subsequent request? Or does the 
implementation of that UAC need to prompt the user to acknowledge 
this is necessary to complete the call set-up?  This seems to me to 
be complicated and against normal user behavior, and I'm thinking 
about whether or not this is being expected to become normal user 
behavior?  I think this might be preventing calls to any 
store/service that implements a network routing plan based on the UAC 
knowing where it is to route the call to the right destination. I 
cannot understand how this would be differentiated by users.

I think this is what we disagree about.  Aside the emergency 
scenario, it is there types of requests that I find it a little hard 
to believe a UA will know that a "routing-entity" will not be needed 
to get the message to the ultimate UAS. How can the UA logic know 
that when calling Pizza Hut or a specific verses nearest garage needs 
to have location used or not?

This almost makes a practical use of this parameter (and this 
RFC(to-be) to RECOMMENDED that "recipient=both" is the default unless 
the UAC _knows_ it doesn't want a server ("routing-entity") to view 
the location.

the two above were taken out, as they do not have parameter-values 
(which I thought one night was the barrier to be included on this 
list).  I can add them in easily.

I think this is what we disagree about.  Aside the emergency 
scenario, it is there types of requests that I find it a little hard 
to believe a UA will know that a "routing-entity" will not be needed 
to get the message to the ultimate UAS. How can the UA logic know 
that when calling Pizza Hut or a specific verses nearest garage needs 
to have location used or not?

This almost makes a practical use of this parameter (and this 
RFC(to-be) to RECOMMENDED that "recipient=both" is the default unless 
the UAC _knows_ it doesn't want a server ("routing-entity") to view 
the location.

went with the alternate above

the two above were taken out, as they do not have parameter-values 
(which I thought one night was the barrier to be included on this 
list).  I can add them in easily.

Hi,

I agree with you that there are still things missing. I have listed a =
number of issues in my slides, based on the comments I've got.
=20
Some comments inline.

>If we go with this approach, then I would note that there are a number
>of additional issues we need to address, for which material is not yet

>
>1)      We should provide guidance as to when it is appropriate to

>draft-burger-sip-info-02.txt is one extreme of this which says NEVER.
>This guidance will need to be taken account of by any review process
>(whatever it is) for IANA registration.

I agree it would be good to have some words about this.

>2)      The registry of packages has to exist. Need to define the =
review
>requirements for adding to the registry.

Yes. This is one of the things I'd thought we handle once we have agreed =
whether we are going to go forward with the draft in the first place, =
though :)

>3)      There should be a template associated with such packages. This
>should prompt the definer of a new package to specify all issues that
>should be covered.

Yes. This is listed as an issue in my slides.

>In particular, one area which needs to be covered is
>how the embedded information tranfer caters for out of sequence
>delivery, given that the carriage mechanism does not guarantee order of
>delivery in all circumstances of SIP usage.

Good point. I will add that to the issues. I guess we have two =
possibilities: either we define some kind of sequence number, or we =
mandate to only have one outstanding INFO transaction at a time - which =
I think could be too restrictive.


>4)      RFC 2976 still references the obsolete SIP RFC, and therefore
>presumably operates to the state machine defined in that RFC, rather
>than the one in RFC 3261. If we are going to resurrect INFO, then
>presumably we need to replace RFC 2976 with either this draft, or a
>companion draft, rather than just update it.

Yes. The possible replacement of 2976 by the draft is covered in my =
slides.

>5)      Do we define packages for ISUP and QSIG?


It is an issue also covered in my slides, and the question is really =
whether we need to do something.

First, we already have standardized, and deployed, mechanisms for ISUP =
and QSIG transport.

Second, ISUP and QSIG may also be sent in the initial INVITE, before you =
have done the Info Package negotiation, and also in other non-INFO =
messages.

Regards,

Christer

The problem is that if the receiver receives a message with Cseq=3DX, it =
doesn't matter whether it will receive Cseq=3DX-1 later, because CSeq =
doesn't have to be incremented by one.
=20
I guess the question is:
=20
Shall it be possible to send a new INFO with the SAME Info Package type =
as in an ongoing INFO transaction?
=20
If you have negotiated multiple Info Package types, being forced to only =
have one outstanding INFO transaction is too restrictive, I think.

I've become more confused just now. The headers on the table in the IANA 
section of this document don't appear to match any of the tables in the 
sip-parameters registry 
<http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters>. If you could point to 
the table in question, I could probably find you a specific example of 
parameters being registered without predefined parameter values in the 
specific table in question. (The specific registry that I think you're 
aiming for is "Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values", which has 
a column to indicate whether the parameter has predefined values -- and 
most of them don't).

But if the INFO is used for dtmf, the rejected request will be a problem
as it will result in loss of digit information. So I think package type
should define whether it is ok to send overlapping requests or not.

Wait a minute. Simply put the issue here is whether the complexity is at
the edge element or device versus in the application server. Either one
needs to correlate and put the digits in order.=20

But if the INFO is used for dtmf, the rejected request will be a problem
as it will result in loss of digit information. So I think package type
should define whether it is ok to send overlapping requests or not.

James,

I have not been following this discussion closely, so apologies if this 
comment doesn't make sense...

It seems like a key issue is understanding *who* will need location 
information for routing purposes, and how it is that they would know 
that they should do so.

I don't think a UAC will be inserting location information in every 
call, so it must have some way of knowing that it will be needed for 
some purpose. Has there been any discussion of that? (If I just dial the 
number for Pizza Hut, my phone won't know. Either I must press some 
special button that says to include location, or else there must a 
response from downstream to the first request indicating that location 
is needed. If the specification of "recipient" must be included, then 
that error response will need to indicate the desired purpose. And then 
the UAC will still have to decide if it is ok to include this.

Next, lets take the Pizza Hut case. If I am calling 
sip:orders@pizzahut.com, then to me pizzahut.com *is* target 
destination. It is probably not difficult for me to decide if I want to 
give pizzahut my location or not. And it is probably irrelevant to me 
whether it is so that the closest branch can be selected for routing, or 
if it is so the pizza can be delivered to me. *If* Pizza Hut wants to do 
routing based on location of caller then it will be done at or 
downstream from pizzahut.com.

The significance of recipient=routing-entity only seems to make sense if 
it is used for routing *before* reaching pizzahut.com. But I don't see 
that as a very valid or plausible use case - at best it is meddling by 
SPs that IMO they ought not be doing.

Perhaps that is more significant and valid if the destination is a 
service URN - e.g. urn:service:pizza. The translation from from a 
service urn to a URI might be a valid reason to use location 
information, and might be done by any routing entity. Its also 
predictable by the UAC that location might be needed for this.

But maybe that isn't a real distinction. With the URN, in effect any 
node on the route can decide to take on the role of translating the URN. 
If it does, then it is in effect the intended recipient of the request.

I don't have a clear suggestion here, but IMO the distinction among 
categories of users of location information seems not quite right.

	Thanks,
	Paul

I'm not sure if we are agreeing or talking past one another.

If R1 is sent with Cseq=X and R2 is sent with Cseq=X+1, and R2 is 
received first, it will be considered a valid request even though there 
was a gap in the Cseq numbering. Then, when R1 finally arrives, its Cseq 
will be too small, so the request will be rejected.

It doesn't matter if it is the same info package type or not. This is a 
fundamental problem with sending multiple requests concurrently in a 
dialog. There is nothing you can do in the specification of INFO that 
will improve on this.

Fixing that would require changing the basic nature Cseq processing in 
3261. I don't know about you, but I am not going to recommend that.

Rather, I think the restriction to one outstanding transaction must be 
accepted as a limitation of using the INFO technique.

I think iw will have to be a responsibility of the sending UA to 
serialize all things that need to travel via INFO.

I think we're getting wrapped around an issue that just doesn't matter.  Th=
e probability of this case is very small, and even if it happens so what?  =
It's like a DTMF tone got lost.  The user has to re-enter their digits.  Th=
at happens regularly in the real world with cell phones, with 2833, and cou=
ld happen with KPML (I think).  As long as it's a rare occurrence per user,=
 it doesn't really matter.

I think we agree. I shouldn't have sent my e-mail after 35 hours without =
sleep :)

Yes.

What I had in mind is whether we would need some additional sequence =
number, which is always incremented by one -similar to what we have for =
PRACK. In that case the receiver would know that there is supposed to =
come something before R2, so it would not accept R2 unti it has received =
R1.

But, before we start looking into such things I think we need to =
consider whether it is really needed. It could also be defined as an =
extension in future (it doesn't even have to be INFO specific, so).

Regards,

Christer

All I am saying here is that a package needs to define what mechanism it
uses to ensure that it has received things in order, assuming that it
matters. My assumption was that this would be package specific, and
dependent on the application.  I was then calling for the template for a
package definition to provide a space for the package definer to specify
this.

There is nothing in the INFO RFC as far as I recall that prevents
multiple INFO messages being in flight at the same time. Additionally
items can be delivered out of order.

One mechanism that may work in some applications, may be to ensure that
a new INFO is not sent until a final response has been received to the
previous one sent. Alternatively, as Christer has said, pay attention to
the Cseq, however straight increments will not work as some other
message could have been sent in between. It probably therefore cannot be
used as a mechanism to determine that an INFO payload has been lost.

By the way, does the proposal cover usage of multiple packages
simultaneously within the same dialog, each with their own sequencing
requirements. If so, that probably adds a further round of complexity.

Working backwards through my mailbox, and I guess I should have read =
this first.

Yes, what I had in mind was the non-delivery of packets, e.g. for the =
reason of non-sequential delivery.

SIP will not tell you you have missed any packets in this case.

I don't think we can be as categorical as that, due to the fact that we
don't know what will exist in the future.

That was why I went for suggesting it should be defined by the
application using the package. We can identify the problems  that exist
- if it matters, it is up to the package designer to specify the fix it
(probably within the transported data itself unless the solution of not
sending another INFO until a final response to the previous is received
works).

Hi Adam,

I believe outbound-11 now correctly uses option-tags.

thanks,

Hi Jeroen,

In outbound-11, the UAC includes the 'ob' parameter in its Contact in  
dialog-forming requests if it wants the first-hop to Record-Route  
with a flow token. This language is flexible enough that it allows an  
implementation to use a GRUU in its contact instead (once it has  
one), to implement outbound without GRUU, and to send an initial  
SUBSCRIBE for the SIP config event package before registration.

I believe this addresses your comment.

thanks,
-rohan

I agree that if a device is going to have much usefulness in  
indicating that media is encrypted, it also needs to say who it is  
from so one can determine that it is not from the MiTM.

But if the sender follows basic NIT rules and doesn't overlap  
transactions within the dialog, then you'll never have out-of-order  
delivery. If you're sending ordered delivery, don't send packet 2  
until packet 1 gets ACKed.

Something that needs to be looked into; I think one of the interworking 
specs to ISUP uses the 503 response code as well to map to certain PSTN 
failure cases. Those need to be looked at to make sure they still fit 
with the proposed new definition.

The draft implies that the Retry-After mechanism provides too 
coarse-grained solution for overload control, and finer-grained controls 
are needed. As you know, some of the solutions being investigated for 
overload algorithms still use on/off behavior but just tune the

Something that needs to be looked into; I think one of the interworking 
specs to ISUP uses the 503 response code as well to map to certain PSTN 
failure cases. Those need to be looked at to make sure they still fit 
with the proposed new definition.

The draft implies that the Retry-After mechanism provides too 
coarse-grained solution for overload control, and finer-grained controls 
are needed. As you know, some of the solutions being investigated for 
overload algorithms still use on/off behavior but just tune the 
Retry-After more algorithmically. So your statements about this need to 
be tempered a bit.

I'm really unsure about whether this is an essential correction or not. 
Its not a functional bug, but a performance bug. So a system based on 
rfc3261 works, but just not that well under load. I'm a bit worried 
that, in an attempt to squeeze this in as an essential correction, we 
may define the wrong thing so as to minimize change. In particular I 
don't like alternative 2 and think we probably need a new response code.

The other big question is, is it worth defining a new response code now, 
and then later on basically updating it with the right overload handling 
behavior, or do it all at once. I think that requires some discussion.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

This looks like a good document and definitely something that is in the 
category of an essential correction. My only comment is that I think 
there is also an issue with v6 URI equality that we need to fix, and may 
as well wrap that into a single v6 essential correction.

Well, I finally had a chance to catch up on this topic - reading both 
Eric's and Hadriel's drafts and most (though not all) of the enormous 
number of messages on this topic.

I personally do not think there is a good definition yet of what the 
problem is that we are trying to solve.

There has been lots of general discussion about INFO usages but for the 
most part, DTMF is the only real concrete one that has come to the 
table. My big worry is that the DTMF "problem" is in fact much bigger 
than just adding negotiation to INFO. Indeed, in a very real sense, 
defining a new INFO package and INFO framework will just add yet ANOTHER 
mechanism to the list of things standardized for DTMF (2833, KPML, 
existing non-standard INFO, unsolicited NOTIFY, and now INFO package). 
The real problem IMHO is that we lack clear guidance on when each of 
these applies and when it doesn't. We have no baseline standard that 
everyone has to implement, and we have no framework for negotiating 
amongst these very different things. I simply do not see how defining an 
INFO framework solves that problem.

What are the actual use cases where DTMF-over-INFO is the 'right' thing? 
The only one I've seen mentioned was the 323 gateway case. Are there 
others? Is that the only use case that this whole mess would actually 
address?

Another big worry is that, if we did have this INFO framework, we would 
be adding another mechanism to an already-long list of ways to handle UA 
to UA signaling. Is it clear what the different areas of applicability 
are for rfc3265 vs. setting up a separate control session vs. new 
methods vs. UPDATE w/ headers vs. the new INFO framework? I don't think 
is clear at all.

To give an example, Hadriel raised a potential new usage of the INFO 
framework for exchanging pictures or vcard in the middle of the call. 
However, we already have a mechanism for doing that via Call-Info. 
Indeed, Call-Info has the benefit of having a "purpose" attribute, which 
defines the context for the URL being exchange. So, would the right way 
to exchange vcards to send an UPDATE with Call-Info? Or send INFO with 
Info-Event: vcard along with the vcard content in the body?

I'm not opposed to a new info framework in principle, but I think its 
not at all clear that, if we defined such a framework, we'd be solving 
any real interoperability problems.

My 2 cents,
Jonathan R.

Firstly, I am still of the opinion that this is NOT an essential 
correction to SIP, but rather a BCP. Clearly the record-route mechanism 
in RFC3261 itself still works and works fine for the cases where it is 
applicable. Documenting double-record routing makes sense, but I do not 
believe it should replace what is in RFC3261 or obsolete it. There is no 
reason to do it, and its unrealistic to think that everyone who is doing 
rr-rewriting will go an change their implementation because IETF decided 
to deprecate something that works.

Section 3.1: this is an unrealistic use case. If this were the actual 
network, no media would be able to flow in the resulting session.

Section 3.2: the indented text seems to include both the original 
rfc3261 text and commentary on it; I think only the orginal text should 
be indented.

this is hyperbole, and not supported by the two points which follow:

sign the route set?? This has never been possible. Even S/MIME doesn't 
support that:

    Header fields that can be legitimately modified by proxy servers are:
    Request-URI, Via, Record-Route, Route, Max-Forwards, and Proxy-
    Authorization.  If these header fields are not intact end-to-end,
    implementations SHOULD NOT consider this a breach of security

I don't know what real attack or real problem you are talking about here.

it is true that there is additional CPU cost. However, that is hardly 
"dangerous". And, I suspect, in most cases, not a very big CPU burden.

I'm not opposed to double record-routing; I am taking objection to the 
vilification of what is in RFC 3261.

> Thus, on the request processing side: item 4 of section 16.6 of

indented?

s/Route/URI


Section 5 has odd indenting.

The document is hard to follow; it intermixes restatements of RFC3261 
sections along with other normative text which is not defined as a 
restateemnt of rfc3261.

I think it would be a clearer document, in fact, if it were not an 
essential correction and instead a clear description of how to double 
record-route and when to do it.

I remember some very wise advice on these sorts of things: a spec is
ready only when there are no non-critical features left to remove. 

I think this is definitely one such feature. More below.

We don't have that today. In fact, today we have a one hour
re-registration interval, and I don't see a lot of people complaining.

2 minutes is too short. It drains the battery. Do you think having an
additional flow in addition to the 2-minute flow will improve the
situation?

Hi Jonathan,
=20
If we do NOT this, it is not going to help interoperability either. =
People will continue using INFO in their own way (even if we go ahead =
with Eric's proposal), and the same discussion will come up at some =
point again (it's similar to the discussion on early media :). Yes, then =
we can say "it's not an IETF problem", but what good will that make for =
interoperability?
=20
If we go ahead with this there will of course still be non-standard =
implementations out there, but at least it will allow for people to use =
a standardized mechanism.
=20
Now, regarding the issue when it's more appropriate to use mechanism X =
rather than mechanism Y,  I think that is something we SHALL work on - =
no matter what we do with the Info Event draft - and I think it would be =
very useful to document. I do NOT think it's part of the Info-Event =
draft, however, but rather something more generic, where we collect and =
describe the difference mechanisms of doing things, the cons and prefs, =
etc. Then people won't have to try to look for different mechanism =
separately, and then try to compare them on their own.
=20
But, as we have discussed, two of the main reasons why people use INFO =
instead of NOTIFY is because they can use the existing invite dialog =
(you CAN do that with NOTIFY also, but as we know there are lots of =
issues with that - which is the reason we recommend not to do it), and =
you don't have to assume the remote entity will know everything you may =
want to send to him (he will have to subscribe before you can send =
anything). INFO often also works better with B2BUAs, uses standard SIP =
mid-dialog routing etc.=20
=20
Regarding DTMF, I agree that it has been the most obvious example, but =
there are also other usages people are looking into. I won't speculate =
about the most obvious DTMF-over-INFO (or DTMF-out-of-band in general) =
use-cases. Interworking with H.323 is certainly one use-case, another =
one is interworking with H.324m (in which case there MAY also be other =
type of information that you want to send), but people also use it for =
"pure" SIP-to-SIP communciations.
=20
Thank You very much for your comments!
=20
Regards,

Vastaanottaja: IETF SIP List
Aihe: [Sip] My two cents on the INFO question



Well, I finally had a chance to catch up on this topic - reading both
Eric's and Hadriel's drafts and most (though not all) of the enormous
number of messages on this topic.

I personally do not think there is a good definition yet of what the
problem is that we are trying to solve.

There has been lots of general discussion about INFO usages but for the
most part, DTMF is the only real concrete one that has come to the
table. My big worry is that the DTMF "problem" is in fact much bigger
than just adding negotiation to INFO. Indeed, in a very real sense,
defining a new INFO package and INFO framework will just add yet ANOTHER
mechanism to the list of things standardized for DTMF (2833, KPML,
existing non-standard INFO, unsolicited NOTIFY, and now INFO package).
The real problem IMHO is that we lack clear guidance on when each of
these applies and when it doesn't. We have no baseline standard that
everyone has to implement, and we have no framework for negotiating
amongst these very different things. I simply do not see how defining an
INFO framework solves that problem.

What are the actual use cases where DTMF-over-INFO is the 'right' thing?
The only one I've seen mentioned was the 323 gateway case. Are there
others? Is that the only use case that this whole mess would actually
address?

Another big worry is that, if we did have this INFO framework, we would
be adding another mechanism to an already-long list of ways to handle UA
to UA signaling. Is it clear what the different areas of applicability
are for rfc3265 vs. setting up a separate control session vs. new
methods vs. UPDATE w/ headers vs. the new INFO framework? I don't think
is clear at all.

To give an example, Hadriel raised a potential new usage of the INFO
framework for exchanging pictures or vcard in the middle of the call.
However, we already have a mechanism for doing that via Call-Info.
Indeed, Call-Info has the benefit of having a "purpose" attribute, which
defines the context for the URL being exchange. So, would the right way
to exchange vcards to send an UPDATE with Call-Info? Or send INFO with
Info-Event: vcard along with the vcard content in the body?

I'm not opposed to a new info framework in principle, but I think its
not at all clear that, if we defined such a framework, we'd be solving
any real interoperability problems.

My 2 cents,
Jonathan R.

In fact, my initial version was not so oriented *against* the rewriting,=20
but some people encouraged me to be more "radical"... (I can give the=20

 This part aims at summarizing parts of the RFC being impacted by the=20

I agree with this main objection, and that it should be re-organized=20
now, will taken into account these recommendations in version -02,

Still need to decide now if it should be a BCP or an RFC 3261 essential=20
correction process document...
Thansk a lot,

Jonathan: Can you elaborate on the v6 URI equality fix?  Are you
referring to the one Brett raised about the equivalence of
sip:[::ffff:192.0.2.128] and sip:[::ffff:c000:280]?

If so, we have decided to include it in this v6 essential correction.

Will add in.

well, MESSAGE methods and presence and probably MSRP would flow. Do  
you mean to say SIP isn't useful for that sort of application?

OK -- then we have it covered.  I have had a conversation
with Brett and Gonzalo and we decided to include v6 URI
equality clarification in  the next release of the draft,
post Vancouver.

I had it in my head many years ago that overlapping NITs were illegal 
also, but I couldn't ever find any supporting text in RFCs. I think it 
was in some pre-publication versions of 2543-bis, but got pulled out 
before finalization.

Huh.  I thought that was clear.  Sorry if the draft wasn't clear on that.  =
We currently have an in-invite-dialog method defined (INFO) that many peopl=
e use, but it's "broken" because it's missing a standardized way to negotia=
te or discover supported uses for INFO, a standardization process for defin=
ing packages for it, and signaling what package the specific INFO request i=
s carrying/notifying.  That's the problem draft-kaplan-sip-info-events is t=
rying to address.

Whether INFO actually needs to be fixed or instead needs to be abandoned is=
 almost a separate issue.  Is that what you're asking?

At the last IETF you said "we should work on things that are broken in the =
real world".  DTMF is broken in the real world (sometimes), except right no=
w SBCs "fix" this issue to make it interop.  I don't mind them doing that f=
orever, but even fixing it is fraught with problems.

My short answer to your question is "I don't know".  I don't know if standa=
rdizing INFO will succeed in attracting implementation by vendors which cur=
rently do non-standard in-dialog INFO/NOTIFY for DTMF.  I don't know if thi=
s will reduce the interop issues.  I don't know if given enough time, those=
 vendors would go implement KPML anyway.

I *do* believe that there is a price to be paid for KPML above that of INFO=
, and that price will keep people doing INFO/NOTIFY.  I *do* know there is =
a need for signaling-plane DTMF.  I *do* know that there is no current stan=
dard for INFO-based DTMF.  I do believe that if we do not offer a standardi=
zed way of doing DMTF in INFO, then the set of {2833, KPML, application/dtm=
f-relay INFO, application/dtmf INFO, application/dtmf-event Notify, etc.} w=
ill not get smaller.  The hope is it gets down to {2833, KPML, INFO}.

We can piss up a rope and outlaw the most popular way to do signaling-plane=
 DTMF.  Or we can account for gravity.

DTMF-over-INFO is the 'right' thing to do when the other side asks to recei=
ve it.  You'd ask to receive it if you're a UA in the call path that wants =
to get DTMF in an Invite dialog in the signaling plane.  It's not just h323=
.  It's MGCP too.  And apparently a bunch of app-servers and PSTN gateways =
that continue to use INFO/NOTIFY today.

I think that could be worked on, with one extreme result being to limit INF=
O to only DTMF.

We should also include that as a point in the discussion.

After Vancouver, Brett and I will sent out some text to the WG
for further comments on v6 equality clarifications.

This would mean a large change to existing parsers and formatters. And
also, the "escaping" and "unescaping" overheads.

Changing the header-value BNF may be more acceptable?

Hi,
=20
Another alternative would be to define an escaping mechanism for
quoted-strings in SIP messages, and require all characters not allowed
by the header-value ABNF to be escaped.

Yes.

Unless someone can show a use-case where the x00-x20 characters would be
needed, for backward compability reasons I think it's better to restrict
quoted-string than to extend extension-header.

   I had it in my head many years ago that overlapping NITs were illegal 
   also, but I couldn't ever find any supporting text in RFCs. I think it 
   was in some pre-publication versions of 2543-bis, but got pulled out 
   before finalization.

I think that overlapped transactions is a basic feature of SIP.  (The
UAC has to be able to deal with the occasional 500 Out Of Order
situation, of course.)

I'm also uncertain if this should be an essential correction.

The only 503 essential corrections that I see needed are clarification
of "server" within the rfc3261 section 21.5.4 and security implications
of honoring a 503's Retry-After.  Draft-hilt-sip-correction-503-01
attempts to provide some clarification concerning "server".  However I
did not notice what should occur if immediate destination IP address of
request was different than source address of 503 response.  Leaving it
vague is ok with me; however the topic (and 503 with Retry-After in
general) should be likely be discussed from a security perspective.

The rest of the draft appears to mainly be an rfc3261 extension and
related justification.

Yes, but just because the protocol can handle overlapped NITs doesn't  
mean the application should send them that way. If you have  
sequential data that needs to be delivered in order (for example,  
MESSAGE requests) you have to sequence the requests at the  
application level.

Hi Aki,

Don't shoot the messenger  ;-)


I think most of our disconnect here is based on the ability to do  
keepalives outside of outbound.

We had consensus to make the document so someone could implement STUN  
keepalives over UDP that does not implement outbound.   This  
motivated the keep-stun URI parameter, later merged into the keep URI  
parameter.

Since the correct keepalive responses are required by the first hop  
when doing outbound, the UAC *could* infer the ability to send  
keepalive pings and receive pongs based on the a successful outbound  
registration working over the same flow.

We could get rid of the keep parameter for outbound registration and  
only use it in non-outbound keepalive uses (and move the definition  
to section 8), but we would need to get the consensus of the WG to do  
that.

More brief comments inline...

I like it, but we need consensus to switch to that.

whether the parameter is there or not is a by product of where it  
appears (in which URIs).  depending on where the URI came from , it  
gets copied to various places.  outbound does not change those rules.

again, we would need to agree to assume that an outbound registration  
is "good-enough".  This is certainly safe for any server that  
correctly implements the spec.

I'm not the one you need to convince here. ;-)

> What about the generic equivalence between :: and=20
> the zeros that it elides?

As Vijay mentioned, enhancements concerning IPv6 (and IPv4) address
equivalency will be added within the next version of the draft.

The initial focus will likely be on the impacts of the variations
presented within rfc4291 sections 2.2 and 2.5.5.  The variations
presented within section 2.2 (such as your question) should be
considered equivalent from a SIP perspective.  However concerning things
like To/From sip-uri's host, I assume that there will currently be poor
interoperability if devices adjust things per section 2.2's flexibility
(beyond hex case) within a transaction or dialog.

I haven't received any feedback concerning impacts of section 2.5.5.
However I assume that they should not be considered equivalent to their
IPv4 addresses from a SIP perspective.  And other IPv6 addresses are
also not equivalent to their IPv4 counterpart; for instance "::1" does
not equal "127.0.0.1".

For prior threads... the following were my initial questions posted to
sip-implementors.  The first reflects questions related to rfc4291
section 2.2.  The second reflects questions related to section 2.5.5.

This is signaled in the SDP with the token "UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVP". See

I can add an example fragment to cover this case.

Jerry, Peter,

Per consenus in Chicago we have ;keep in outbound-11 instead of ;keep-

&gt; Hi Cullen and Rohan,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In the draft, it requires the UA configure the next hop route &nbsp;<br>
&gt; header with &quot;keep-stun&quot;, &quot;keep-crlf&quot;, or &quot;timed-keepalive&quot;
tags. &nbsp;<br>
&gt; This would cause some problems.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. As an example, the route-set contains this route header as &nbsp;<br>
&gt; indicated in section 9 example:<br>
&gt; Route: &lt;sip:pri.example.com;lr;keep-stun&gt;<br>
&gt; If the DNS NAPTR resolution for pri.example.com is TCP, SCTP or &nbsp;<br>
&gt; TLS, the keep-stun will be useless. Vice versa, if the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; pri.example.com is resolved as UDP, and if &quot;keep-crlf&quot; was
manually &nbsp;<br>
&gt; configured, it is not working either.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. Before sending the REGISTER request, the admin/or user does not
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; know what keep-alive mechanism the proxy (or edge proxy) supports.
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; Blindly configure the keep-stun, or keep-crlf would cause the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; problem that the draft indicated itself in section 8: &quot;the node
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; could be blacklisted for UDP traffic&quot;.<br>
&gt; The better approach is to let the UA and the proxy to negotiate, &nbsp;<br>
&gt; not manually configure from UA side.<br>
&gt; a. UA sends REGISTER to the proxy with a &quot;outbound&quot; tag
in the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; Supported header.<br>
&gt; b. Proxy insert the &quot;outbound&quot; tag in the 200 OK, if the
UA &nbsp;<br>
&gt; indicated that it supports the outbound.<br>
&gt; c. If the &quot;outbound&quot; tag is present in the 200 OK, and if
the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; transport is UDP, using the STUN keep alive, other connection based
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; transport using crlf keep alive.<br>
&gt; There would be no way to mass up by configurations with this &nbsp;<br>
&gt; approach. Let me know if I missed something.<br>

however, since you have already published the draft with the "keep"

Hi,

Existing parsers would work, in the sense that they would not report =
error due to unallowed characters.=20

But, if you are interested in the actual escapted value you would of =
course have to add the "unescaping" functionality.


>Changing the header-value BNF may be more acceptable?

Any solution which EXTENDS what we have today may cause problems with =
existing parsers.

Hi,

Another alternative would be to define an escaping mechanism for
quoted-strings in SIP messages, and require all characters not allowed
by the header-value ABNF to be escaped.

Regards,

Christer

Yes.

Unless someone can show a use-case where the x00-x20 characters would be
needed, for backward compability reasons I think it's better to restrict
quoted-string than to extend extension-header.

We have a couple of milestones that we generated as a result of
discussion of=20

Dec 2007    Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to
WGLC =20
Feb 2008    Delivering request-URI and parameters to UAS via proxy to
IESG (PS) =20

This work is currently stalled and the editor needs input.

The document contains various example scenarios where a solution is
required, for which there appears to be no dispute that a solution is
needed.

The document proposes one solution to resolve these example scenarios,
but this solution is not gaining consensus. At least one other solution
has been talked about, but there is no documentation on the table.

This mail is to identify a deadline for other solutions to the example
scenarios to be documented as internet drafts, showing how the solution
works for those scenarios. This deadline is:

	January 11th 2008

It is appropriate fo these documents to identify any other scenarios
where such a solution is appropriate. Any other input is also welcome in
identifying other scenarios.

If we have no such internet-drafts by this deadline, we will proceed
with completing the solution we have.


Regards

Keith

Hi,
=20
In order to think about documenting "alternative solutions", I have a =
question for clarifications regarding the scope of the problem we are =
trying to solve.
=20
The MECHANISM part of the draft says that a UA supporting the mechanism =
would indicate it to the registrar, and the registrar would only use the =
mechanism in case the UA has indicated support for it (that is also =
shown in the example in the draft). It has also been claimed that this =
would be backward compatible with an MGC which uses the R-URI to map to =
ISUP Called Party number, because the MGC does not register so the =
mechanism would not be used towards it.=20
=20
My question is: does this mean that the only entity allowed to use this =
mechanism is the registrar, since the mechanism is used based on whether =
the UA supports it or not?=20
=20
When reading the USE-CASE part of the draft, I would say that the answer =
is "no". Because, as I understand the text, there could be non-registrar =
entities in the path, which today normally would re-write the R-URI, but =
would now instead use this mechanism. Is my understanding correct?
=20
If so, my next question is: these non-registrar entities have no clue =
about whether the terminating UA supports the mechanism or not, or =
whether the call will be routed towards an MGC. So, what happens if the =
request is routed towards an UA that has not indicated support, or =
towards an MGC? The MGC may not be able to map the R-URI.
=20
Regards,
=20
Christer

   From: "Brett Tate" <brett@broadsoft.com>

   However concerning things
   like To/From sip-uri's host, I assume that there will currently be poor
   interoperability if devices adjust things per section 2.2's flexibility
   (beyond hex case) within a transaction or dialog.

To and From headers shouldn't be a problem because applications really
shouldn't be comparing them; they should be treated as comments.
IIRC, there is some circumstance during registration where URI
equivalence is important, though.

   I haven't received any feedback concerning impacts of section 2.5.5.
   However I assume that they should not be considered equivalent to their
   IPv4 addresses from a SIP perspective.  And other IPv6 addresses are
   also not equivalent to their IPv4 counterpart; for instance "::1" does
   not equal "127.0.0.1".

That makes sense to me.

Dale

RFC 3261 still requires the To/From uri's to not change.  However I
agree that it won't be a problem if vendors have adjusted/deployed their
implementations based upon rfc3261's comment that such a requirement is
expected to be deprecated in the future or have accommodated the IPv6
address representation flexibility.

Hi,

I plan to completely revamp the example and will incorporate these

ok, I added, then accidentally deleted this in -11.  This is now  
fixed in my local copy.

I am going to completely rewrite the example based on your advice here.

The existing example is wrong in many ways and will be completely  
replaced.

do you think Section 4 should have a separate subsection?  All you  
need to do is leave your flow open and be prepared to receive  
messages over it.

Yes.

Hi,

As indicated in the meeting, I wonder what people think about allowing
the Flow-timer parameter also in request messages. It would provide the
following:

1) The UA can indicate the minimum keep-alive timer, which can be based
on battery life, CPU power, or whatever... We also need some wording and
guidance about what to do if the value in the response is too small for
the UA.

2) The UA can indicate that it is able to perform keep-alives (similar
to the "keepalive" option-tag), even if the UA does not support
outbound, and/or if the registrar does not support outbound, or outbound
is disabled for whatever other reason.

Regards,

Christer

I think the procedures for a standards track document makes it clear
that we have to separate the UAS from the UAC from the Proxy =
requirements.
Yes.

The SDP Capability Negotiation part is fine albeit you could argue it 
would be cleaner to have the DTLS-SRTP related attributes encoded as 
attribute capabilities rather than as first-level attributes.

Jon,

At the microphone I believe you were referring to section 11 of RFC4474.  The
first paragraph is relevant to today's discussion in SIP and I highlighted a
specific sentence.  The highlighted sentence does not consider session border
controllers which, on today's deployments, _are_ the majority of cases
(majority of call minutes and the majority of phone calls):

   11.  Identity and the TEL URI Scheme

   Since many SIP applications provide a Voice over IP (VoIP) service,
   telephone numbers are commonly used as identities in SIP deployments.
   In the majority of cases, this is not problematic for the identity
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   mechanism described in this document.  Telephone numbers commonly
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   appear in the username portion of a SIP URI (e.g.,
   'sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com;user=phone').  That username
   conforms to the syntax of the TEL URI scheme (RFC 3966 [13]).  For
   this sort of SIP address-of-record, chicago.example.com is the
   appropriate signatory.

The rest of the section is available at:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4474#section-11
but discusses only the TEL URI (which has no domain name).


We will need more text in Jason's document to discuss this in more detail.

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

We failed to achieve agreement in the SIP WG on one of the issues for
location conveyance.

The chairs and AD considered we were unlikely to get rapid agreement on
list and a further face-to-face discussion in Vancounver would be
appropriate.

Therefore we have:=20

Place:	Salon 2=20
Time:		16:15=20
Date:		Thursday 6th December
Duration:	1 hour

for those who are interested in resolving this problem.

For when a proxy is talking to a registered UA, yes.

That is not the intent.

The idea is, any proxy that is translating a request-URI, is doing so 
based on some kind of mapping table. There are many ways that this 
mapping table can get into the proxy:

1. dynamically through register
2. provisioned
3. through an enum query
etc.

If we take provisioning as an example (i.e., someone enters phone number 
routing rules via prefix matching rules), when those rules are 
provisioned, they would include a flag which says whether the 
destination is loose-route compliant. If they are loose route compliant, 
the proxy uses a Route header, else it uses r-uri translation as is 
currently done.

As above, no.

Yes.

Hopefully the above paragraph answers your question.

This strikes me as a problem in theory and not in practice. AFAICT, the 
only characters you can't use are ascii 0x00-0x19 (0x20 is space and is 
possible through the LWS construct as Christer pointed out). Is there a 
practical use case for any of these? They are:

Dean, according to the picture, there is NO IP CONNECTIVITY between 
endpoints. Only a SIP proxy connects them. Nothing will work.

MESSAGE requires only a SIP proxy to span this. MSRP could easily  
have a parallel set of relays. This was actually a fairly typical  
enterprise network (at least through the mid 1990s), where there is  
no IP connectivity between the corp net and the Internet. All cross- 
net connectivity is provided by per-protocol proxies. I built up 50  
or more enterprise networks with exactly this property.

SIP is useful without media. You ever use Micosoft's IM client?

I believe there were two points of contention at Monday's SIP meeting 
wrt Location Conveyance:

  -- the "recipient=" providing an expected result, given no security 
properties, and

  -- the granularity of error codes

I'm not sure we're planning on talking about the first topic 
tomorrow, and I definitely consider it secondary to solving the error 
code issue.

Now, folks admitted that they hadn't read the recent version of the 
ID, and the error section has changed a great deal.  Thus, I ask that 
everyone attending tomorrow's face-to-face read section 3.4 , and all 
of section 5 to bring yourself up to speed on the current text.  The ID is here

Hi all,

I guess the purpose of this discussion is about this particular draft,
which intends to correct some mistakes existing in some RFCs.

I am wondering if you will want to discuss about the impacts of mapping
between IPv6 address and IPv4 address?

I feel like if we simply try to match the two from each other, we will
not be able to maintain the original design beauties behind each address
structure.  Correct me if I am wrong.

Best regards,
Jane D. Jiang

RFC 3261 still requires the To/From uri's to not change.  However I
agree that it won't be a problem if vendors have adjusted/deployed their
implementations based upon rfc3261's comment that such a requirement is
expected to be deprecated in the future or have accommodated the IPv6
address representation flexibility.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies
	Author(s)       : R. Sparks, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06.txt
	Pages           : 22
	Date            : 2007-11-03

This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP
proxy behavior.  This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP
networks where a small number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP
requests can stimulate massive amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic.

This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies
when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one
destination).  It also corrects and clarifies the description of the
loop-detection algorithm such proxies are required to implement.
Additionally, this document defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for
limiting the number of concurrent branches pursued for any given
request.

	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Yes; the draft is expanding beyond the current ABNF fix to also correct
or more clearly document other IPv6 areas of rfc3261.

I'm not sure which aspect of mapping you are mentioning.
Draft-ietf-sipping-v6-transition and
draft-ietf-sipping-ipv6-torture-tests discuss some of the potential
issues.

I'm not sure that I understand the matching comment.  The current
understanding is that an IPv6 address does not equal an IPv4 address
from a SIP equality perspective.  However there are obviously
situations/services on a device where they might be treated the same:
identity, access control, etcetera.

There are situations where an IPv6 address contains an IPv4 address.
However I currently doubt that we need to discuss the matter beyond
highlighting such an address concerning equality and maybe additionally
503, looping, downgrading to IPv4, etcetera.

(As WG chair)

We working group last called this a few weeks back.

I have been checking the revised version, and it seems to me that all
the comments have been addressed.

Does anyone else have any issues to raise on this document. I am
starting to prepare the IESG publication request, and it would be
helpful to know if more discussion is needed way before I finish this.

In the absence of response I will be declaring this document done, bar
the normal checks I do before the publish request in order to get this
document into a format for IESG.

Regards

Keith

   From: Jonathan Rosenberg <jdrosen@cisco.com>

   This strikes me as a problem in theory and not in practice. AFAICT, the 
   only characters you can't use are ascii 0x00-0x19 (0x20 is space and is 
   possible through the LWS construct as Christer pointed out). Is there a 
   practical use case for any of these? They are:

HT (horizontal tab) should be included, but that's also in LWS.  As
for the remaining characters, I don't think that anyone has ever
*intended* that they be used in SIP headers, and their inclusion in
quoted-pair was a typographical error.

Dale

Howdy,
Jonathan asked for use-cases for what types of things would need an in-dial=
og SIP message for user-user communication, vs. should be done either out o=
f dialog or in the media plane.  If the only use-case is DTMF, then we coul=
d just document the DTMF negotiation/use only and not have to create a gene=
ral info-events framework.  That seems a very reasonable argument to me.  I=
 also don't want to do work for no use.

There is a counter-argument that there are proprietary uses of INFO in the =
wild, and that a framework for negotiation at least removes the manual conf=
iguration of vendor-specific profiles, which is a problem of interop today =
- even if the IETF should not bless/document the specific use cases themsel=
ves.  But that would make the draft a very different one than it currently =
is as well, and I will ask that in a separate email thread.

The chairs have asked for 3 use cases, and I assume they mean 3 NEW use cas=
es (we already have 3 RFCs which use INFO, as well as DTMF).  I am not sure=
 if they mean potential future use-cases, or current use-cases (i.e., alrea=
dy implemented).  Can I get a clarification on that?

So anyway, taking the shot-gun approach, here's a first go at some use-case=
s, and my personal take on whether they should be in INFO vs. SUB/NOT vs. m=
edia-plane, FWIW.
[apologize for formatting ugliness]

/***************
*  Already standardized use-cases:
***************/
1) SIP-T/ISUP/QSIG/PSTN
        -Documented in RFC 3372 and RFC 4497.

2) ECMA TR/87 uaCSTA
        -Uses INFO to send ECMA-323 XML for monitoring and controlling phon=
es from a PC.

3) Sending media server control commands.
        -Documented in RFC4722 MSCML.


/****************
*  Use-cases that I think are potentially/possibly valid for INFO:
****************/
1) Sending a vcard asynchronously.  Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can you se=
nd me John's vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.
        -Alternatives: send a re-Invite or Update with a Call-Info, with ei=
ther a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL.
        -Counter-argument: IMO this type of data really belongs in MIME for=
 a number of reasons, including length is less restricted for mime attachme=
nts; one AD has said the Data URL may be deprecated.  And sending a re-Invi=
te for this purpose seems odd.
        -Also, the Call-Info header is really about the caller or callee, a=
nd thus Bob shouldn't be sending me John's vcard info in it technically.  T=
hat may sound like a nit, but UA's may well store the call-info vcards into=
 their address-books automatically and so tie it to the wrong user/call.
        -Pros of using INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you send =
the vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, and you=
 can send it based on user input.

2) Sending a user-icon jpeg/bitmap/gif.  Alice calls Bob, Bob has an icon t=
hat represents himself, sends it when he picks up the phone.
        -Alternatives: send a 200ok, re-Invite, or Update with call-info, w=
hich explicitly has a type for icon.
        -Counter-argument: same as for vcard, plus with call-info there is =
no way to know which picture format the far-end supports a priori.  With a =
supported-package negotiation one could know.

3) Sending a vcalendar-type invitation.  Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey let=
's have a con call at time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a vcalendar=
.
        -Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or not and thus wh=
ether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or not is certainly debatab=
le.  Message method can already be used for this anyway.

4) Sending an HTTP URL.  Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for more =
info or a datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her web-brow=
ser.
        -One could also argue this is just making SIP the new SMTP, or this=
 should be sent using MESSAGE (which really is the new SMTP).

5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice does =
a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info with an inc=
rementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not really max-forwar=
ds), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.
        -It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, SBCs) would ever a=
llow this type of thing to happen, due to security concerns, but I think th=
ey may do it at domain boundary hops.  I think this is a reasonable use for=
 INFO though, maybe.

6) Sending geo-location information after call establishment.  Alice calls =
Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for directions to hotel, clicks butt=
on and sends him location info of her phone (or Bob clicks button and sends=
 her his location).
        -The location conveyance draft specifically calls out INFO as accep=
table for geo-loc info.  Whether this is a real use-case is debatable, and =
obviously it could be done with a sub/not.

7) Sending softkey-labels (not digit-match maps, but rather softkey button =
labels).  Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends softkey-labels =
for the menu items available in the response, Alice presses softkeys and se=
nds them in INFO.
        -This could (and maybe should) be done with sub/not, a la KPML, whe=
re the vmail server sends the softkey labels in the Subscribe, UA sends but=
tons pressed in Notifies.  But this is similar to the DTMF use case so may =
well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons are rarely press=
ed.

8) Sending a screen-pop-up message, e.g., "Do you want to continue with thi=
s session?"
        -There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  I guess Al=
ert-Info could be used for this, but it's not clear it should?


/*****************
*  Use-cases which have been proposed by others or even implemented,
*  which are dubious for INFO (IMHO):
*****************/
1) Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call.
        -There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the signa=
ling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media plane box tha=
t gets RTCP.  Again this could (and IMO should) be done with sub/not, so it=
 can get stats after the call is over, and since it will probably want peri=
odic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be dwarfed by the number =
of Notifies.

2) Sending access-location information after call establishment.
        -There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have proposed to=
 send an update for it as a phone roams access points or cells.  But I thin=
k this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite session, vs. in a sub/not or =
Register (and besides half the time the network inserts this header, not th=
e UA).

3) Sending media-control indications (ie, remote-control "play/pause/etc.")
        -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if it'=
s the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, excep=
t at a media content layer above RTP, so not done in RTCP nor SDP.

4) Sending video fast update command
        -This is an informational draft, which documents what has been impl=
emented, but states it should really be done in the media plane.

5) Sending peripheral control commands (ie, USB commands)
        -There is actually a patent on this, amazingly.  Someone thinks it =
makes sense to create a SIP session to your laptop, or vice-versa, and then=
 send USB commands inside MIME in INFO messages.  Methinks this should be m=
edia-plane, if anything.

6) Sending charging information for a call (i.e., minutes remaining or cost=
 so far).
        -There was a proposal to use this for Advice of Charge information =
in TISPAN.  IMO it should be a sub/not though, as they want this to survive=
 the Invite session.

In my initial review of the document prior to submission, I have
identified the following points that are slightly more than editorial.

1)	I don't believe we need the abbreviation "RPH" at all. One of
the major usages is in conjunction with the word "namespace" and the
correct name of the namespace is the "Resource-Priority namespace" not
the "Resource-Priority header namespace". I would prefer to do what RFC
4412 does which is in the IANA section and at the first instance in the
document refer to the full name, and just use "namespace" elsewhere.

2)	Change abstract to:

   This document creates additional Session Initiation Protocol=20
   Resource-Priority namespaces, and places these namespaces in the IANA
register. =20

3)	Section 2:

Change: This MAY change in future efforts.

To: 	Other namespace definitions in the future could change this.

Reason: Inappropriate usage of RFC 2119 language.

4)	RFC 4412 states:

  o  A namespace may either reference an existing list of priority
      values or define a new finite list of priority values in relative
      priority order for IANA registration within the sip-parameters
      Resource-Priority priority-values registry.  New priority-values
      SHOULD NOT be added to a previously IANA-registered list
      associated with a particular namespace, as this may cause
      interoperability problems.  Unless otherwise specified, it is
      assumed that all priority values confer higher priority than
      requests without a priority value.

The multiple namespaces defined in this document all use the same finite
list of priority values. Why do we need multiple new entries within the
Resource-Priority Priority-values registry, rather than just reuse the
same one.

NITS:

1)	Change section 1 from

Each will be RFC 4412 defined as preemption=20
   based in nature, and will have the same 9 priority-values.=20

To=20

Each will be preemption=20
in nature, as defined in RFC 4412, and will have the same 9
priority-values.=20

2)	Change section 1 From

   DISA has a requirement to be able to assign different RPH namespaces
   to different units of differing sizes throughout their networks.=20
   Examples of this may be

To=20

   DISA has a requirement to be able to assign different

Subject: [Sip] INFO use-cases



Howdy,
Jonathan asked for use-cases for what types of things would need an =
in-dialog SIP message for user-user communication, vs. should be done =
either out of dialog or in the media plane.  If the only use-case is =
DTMF, then we could just document the DTMF negotiation/use only and not =
have to create a general info-events framework.  That seems a very =
reasonable argument to me.  I also don't want to do work for no use.

There is a counter-argument that there are proprietary uses of INFO in =
the wild, and that a framework for negotiation at least removes the =
manual configuration of vendor-specific profiles, which is a problem of =
interop today - even if the IETF should not bless/document the specific =
use cases themselves.  But that would make the draft a very different =
one than it currently is as well, and I will ask that in a separate =
email thread.

The chairs have asked for 3 use cases, and I assume they mean 3 NEW use =
cases (we already have 3 RFCs which use INFO, as well as DTMF).  I am =
not sure if they mean potential future use-cases, or current use-cases =
(i.e., already implemented).  Can I get a clarification on that?

So anyway, taking the shot-gun approach, here's a first go at some =
use-cases, and my personal take on whether they should be in INFO vs. =
SUB/NOT vs. media-plane, FWIW.
[apologize for formatting ugliness]

/***************
*  Already standardized use-cases:
***************/
1) SIP-T/ISUP/QSIG/PSTN
        -Documented in RFC 3372 and RFC 4497.

2) ECMA TR/87 uaCSTA
        -Uses INFO to send ECMA-323 XML for monitoring and controlling =
phones from a PC.

3) Sending media server control commands.
        -Documented in RFC4722 MSCML.


/****************
*  Use-cases that I think are potentially/possibly valid for INFO:
****************/
1) Sending a vcard asynchronously.  Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can you =
send me John's vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.
        -Alternatives: send a re-Invite or Update with a Call-Info, with =
either a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL.
        -Counter-argument: IMO this type of data really belongs in MIME =
for a number of reasons, including length is less restricted for mime =
attachments; one AD has said the Data URL may be deprecated.  And =
sending a re-Invite for this purpose seems odd.
        -Also, the Call-Info header is really about the caller or =
callee, and thus Bob shouldn't be sending me John's vcard info in it =
technically.  That may sound like a nit, but UA's may well store the =
call-info vcards into their address-books automatically and so tie it to =
the wrong user/call.
        -Pros of using INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you =
send the vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, =
and you can send it based on user input.

2) Sending a user-icon jpeg/bitmap/gif.  Alice calls Bob, Bob has an =
icon that represents himself, sends it when he picks up the phone.
        -Alternatives: send a 200ok, re-Invite, or Update with =
call-info, which explicitly has a type for icon.
        -Counter-argument: same as for vcard, plus with call-info there =
is no way to know which picture format the far-end supports a priori.  =
With a supported-package negotiation one could know.

3) Sending a vcalendar-type invitation.  Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey =
let's have a con call at time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a =
vcalendar.
        -Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or not and thus =
whether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or not is certainly =
debatable.  Message method can already be used for this anyway.

4) Sending an HTTP URL.  Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for =
more info or a datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her =
web-browser.
        -One could also argue this is just making SIP the new SMTP, or =
this should be sent using MESSAGE (which really is the new SMTP).

5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice =
does a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info =
with an incrementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not =
really max-forwards), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.
        -It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, SBCs) would =
ever allow this type of thing to happen, due to security concerns, but I =
think they may do it at domain boundary hops.  I think this is a =
reasonable use for INFO though, maybe.

6) Sending geo-location information after call establishment.  Alice =
calls Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for directions to hotel, =
clicks button and sends him location info of her phone (or Bob clicks =
button and sends her his location).
        -The location conveyance draft specifically calls out INFO as =
acceptable for geo-loc info.  Whether this is a real use-case is =
debatable, and obviously it could be done with a sub/not.

7) Sending softkey-labels (not digit-match maps, but rather softkey =
button labels).  Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends =
softkey-labels for the menu items available in the response, Alice =
presses softkeys and sends them in INFO.
        -This could (and maybe should) be done with sub/not, a la KPML, =
where the vmail server sends the softkey labels in the Subscribe, UA =
sends buttons pressed in Notifies.  But this is similar to the DTMF use =
case so may well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons =
are rarely pressed.

8) Sending a screen-pop-up message, e.g., "Do you want to continue with =
this session?"
        -There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  I guess =
Alert-Info could be used for this, but it's not clear it should?


/*****************
*  Use-cases which have been proposed by others or even implemented,
*  which are dubious for INFO (IMHO):
*****************/
1) Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call.
        -There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the =
signaling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media plane =
box that gets RTCP.  Again this could (and IMO should) be done with =
sub/not, so it can get stats after the call is over, and since it will =
probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be =
dwarfed by the number of Notifies.

2) Sending access-location information after call establishment.
        -There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have proposed =
to send an update for it as a phone roams access points or cells.  But I =
think this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite session, vs. in a =
sub/not or Register (and besides half the time the network inserts this =
header, not the UA).

3) Sending media-control indications (ie, remote-control =
"play/pause/etc.")
        -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if =
it's the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, =
except at a media content layer above RTP, so not done in RTCP nor SDP.

4) Sending video fast update command
        -This is an informational draft, which documents what has been =
implemented, but states it should really be done in the media plane.

5) Sending peripheral control commands (ie, USB commands)
        -There is actually a patent on this, amazingly.  Someone thinks =
it makes sense to create a SIP session to your laptop, or vice-versa, =
and then send USB commands inside MIME in INFO messages.  Methinks this =
should be media-plane, if anything.

6) Sending charging information for a call (i.e., minutes remaining or =
cost so far).
        -There was a proposal to use this for Advice of Charge =
information in TISPAN.  IMO it should be a sub/not though, as they want =
this to survive the Invite session.

   1)	Change section 1 from

   Each will be RFC 4412 defined as preemption 
      based in nature, and will have the same 9 priority-values. 

   To 

   Each will be preemption 
   in nature, as defined in RFC 4412, and will have the same 9
   priority-values. 

I think the way you want to phrase that is "Each will use a preemption
policy, as defined in RFC 4412, ...".  It would read even more easily
if you said "Each will be preemptive [in nature], ...", but
"preemptive" does not appear in RFC 4412.  But "preemption policy" is
used in section 4.5.1.

Hadriel,

I buy some of your use cases, but not others. Comments below.

A competitor for INFO in several of these is MESSAGE. I think a good 
case can be made for that if the information is to be rendered to the 
recipient.

For this case MESSAGE seems entirely appropriate.

(Not so much so for vcard, which probably isn't intended to be directly 
rendered to the recipient.)

Yes to MESSAGE.

> 5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice does a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info with an incrementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not really max-forwards), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.

UPDATE with geo-loc is reasonable here, or even reINVITE.

But this is similar to the DTMF use case so may well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons are rarely pressed.

This is very definitely a use case for MESSAGE.

Also, all of the above could probably be justifiably sent via MSRP - 
either directly or via the file transfer extensions.

>         -There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the signaling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media plane box that gets RTCP.  Again this could (and IMO should) be done with sub/not, so it can get stats after the call is over, and since it will probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be dwarfed by the number of Notifies.

>         -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if it's the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, except at a media content layer above RTP, so not done in RTCP nor SDP.

Jonathan asked for use-cases for what types of things would need an =
in-dialog SIP message for user-user communication, vs. should be done =
either out of dialog or in the media plane.  If the only use-case is =
DTMF, then we could just document the DTMF negotiation/use only and not =
have to create a general info-events framework.  That seems a very =
reasonable argument to me.  I also don't want to do work for no use.=0A=
=0A=
There is a counter-argument that there are proprietary uses of INFO in =
the wild, and that a framework for negotiation at least removes the =
manual configuration of vendor-specific profiles, which is a problem of =
interop today - even if the IETF should not bless/document the specific =
use cases themselves.  But that would make the draft a very different =
one than it currently is as well, and I will ask that in a separate =
email thread.=0A=
=0A=
The chairs have asked for 3 use cases, and I assume they mean 3 NEW use =
cases (we already have 3 RFCs which use INFO, as well as DTMF).  I am =
not sure if they mean potential future use-cases, or current use-cases =
(i.e., already implemented).  Can I get a clarification on that?=0A=

        -Documented in RFC4722 MSCML.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
/****************=0A=
*  Use-cases that I think are potentially/possibly valid for INFO:=0A=
****************/=0A=
1) Sending a vcard asynchronously.  Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can you =
send me John's vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.=0A=
        -Alternatives: send a re-Invite or Update with a Call-Info, with =
either a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL.=0A=
        -Counter-argument: IMO this type of data really belongs in MIME =
for a number of reasons, including length is less restricted for mime =
attachments; one AD has said the Data URL may be deprecated.  And =
sending a re-Invite for this purpose seems odd.=0A=
=0A=
        -Also, the Call-Info header is really about the caller or =
callee, and thus Bob shouldn't be sending me John's vcard info in it =
technically.  That may sound like a nit, but UA's may well store the =
call-info vcards into their address-books automatically and so tie it to =
the wrong user/call.=0A=
        -Pros of using INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you =
send the vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, =
and you can send it based on user input.=0A=
=0A=
2) Sending a user-icon jpeg/bitmap/gif.  Alice calls Bob, Bob has an =
icon that represents himself, sends it when he picks up the phone.=0A=
        -Alternatives: send a 200ok, re-Invite, or Update with =
call-info, which explicitly has a type for icon.=0A=
        -Counter-argument: same as for vcard, plus with call-info there =
is no way to know which picture format the far-end supports a priori.  =
With a supported-package negotiation one could know.=0A=
=0A=
3) Sending a vcalendar-type invitation.  Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey =
let's have a con call at time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a =
vcalendar..=0A=
        -Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or not and thus =
whether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or not is certainly =
debatable.  Message method can already be used for this anyway.=0A=
=0A=
4) Sending an HTTP URL.  Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for =
more info or a datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her =
web-browser.=0A=
        -One could also argue this is just making SIP the new SMTP, or =
this should be sent using MESSAGE (which really is the new SMTP).=0A=
=0A=
5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice =
does a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info =
with an incrementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not =
really max-forwards), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.=0A=
        -It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, SBCs) would =
ever allow this type of thing to happen, due to security concerns, but I =
think they may do it at domain boundary hops.  I think this is a =
reasonable use for INFO though, maybe.=0A=
=0A=
6) Sending geo-location information after call establishment.  Alice =
calls Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for directions to hotel, =
clicks button and sends him location info of her phone (or Bob clicks =
button and sends her his location).=0A=
        -The location conveyance draft specifically calls out INFO as =
acceptable for geo-loc info.  Whether this is a real use-case is =
debatable, and obviously it could be done with a sub/not.=0A=
=0A=
7) Sending softkey-labels (not digit-match maps, but rather softkey =
button labels).  Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends =
softkey-labels for the menu items available in the response, Alice =
presses softkeys and sends them in INFO.=0A=
        -This could (and maybe should) be done with sub/not, a la KPML, =
where the vmail server sends the softkey labels in the Subscribe, UA =
sends buttons pressed in Notifies.  But this is similar to the DTMF use =
case so may well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons =
are rarely pressed.=0A=
=0A=
8) Sending a screen-pop-up message, e.g., "Do you want to continue with =
this session?"=0A=
        -There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  I guess =
Alert-Info could be used for this, but it's not clear it should?=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
/*****************=0A=
*  Use-cases which have been proposed by others or even implemented,=0A=
*  which are dubious for INFO (IMHO):=0A=
*****************/=0A=
1) Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call.=0A=
        -There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the =
signaling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media plane =
box that gets RTCP.  Again this could (and IMO should) be done with =
sub/not, so it can get stats after the call is over, and since it will =
probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be =
dwarfed by the number of Notifies.=0A=
=0A=
2) Sending access-location information after call establishment.=0A=
        -There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have proposed =
to send an update for it as a phone roams access points or cells.  But I =
think this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite session, vs. in a =
sub/not or Register (and besides half the time the network inserts this =
header, not the UA).=0A=
=0A=
3) Sending media-control indications (ie, remote-control =
"play/pause/etc.")=0A=
        -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if =
it's the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, =
except at a media content layer above RTP, so not done in RTCP nor SDP.=0A=
=0A=
4) Sending video fast update command=0A=
        -This is an informational draft, which documents what has been =
implemented, but states it should really be done in the media plane.=0A=
=0A=
5) Sending peripheral control commands (ie, USB commands)=0A=
        -There is actually a patent on this, amazingly.  Someone thinks =
it makes sense to create a SIP session to your laptop, or vice-versa, =
and then send USB commands inside MIME in INFO messages.  Methinks this =
should be media-plane, if anything.=0A=
=0A=
6) Sending charging information for a call (i.e., minutes remaining or =
cost so far).=0A=
        -There was a proposal to use this for Advice of Charge =
information in TISPAN.  IMO it should be a sub/not though, as they want =
this to survive the Invite session.=0A=
=0A=

In fact if INFO is outlawed for anything but DTMF....   ATIS  and tispan =

Hadriel,

I buy some of your use cases, but not others. Comments below.

A competitor for INFO in several of these is MESSAGE. I think a good
case can be made for that if the information is to be rendered to the
recipient.

For this case MESSAGE seems entirely appropriate.

(Not so much so for vcard, which probably isn't intended to be directly
rendered to the recipient.)

Yes to MESSAGE.

UPDATE with geo-loc is reasonable here, or even reINVITE.

This is very definitely a use case for MESSAGE.

Also, all of the above could probably be justifiably sent via MSRP -
either directly or via the file transfer extensions.

Hi Brett,

Though IPv6 was initially designed to address the IP address space
issue, I feel like the mobility feature afforded by IPv6 address design
is a true value added. =20

When we are mapping from IPv6 to IPv4, we will certainly loose some
information.  However, when we are mapping from IPv4 to IPv6, how can we
expand the digits in a way that we can actually  make the mapped IPv6
address to support mobility?  That is my question.

Thanks!

Jane

Yes; the draft is expanding beyond the current ABNF fix to also correct
or more clearly document other IPv6 areas of rfc3261.

I'm not sure which aspect of mapping you are mentioning.
Draft-ietf-sipping-v6-transition and
draft-ietf-sipping-ipv6-torture-tests discuss some of the potential
issues.

I'm not sure that I understand the matching comment.  The current
understanding is that an IPv6 address does not equal an IPv4 address
from a SIP equality perspective.  However there are obviously
situations/services on a device where they might be treated the same:
identity, access control, etcetera.

There are situations where an IPv6 address contains an IPv4 address.
However I currently doubt that we need to discuss the matter beyond
highlighting such an address concerning equality and maybe additionally
503, looping, downgrading to IPv4, etcetera.

Hey Paul,
Yeah I agree MESSAGE makes a lot of sense for things to be rendered nativel=
y/directly to the user.

Regarding using MSRP: while that is obviously possible and for some cases u=
ndoubtedly the right thing to do, for some uses it is a crazy amount of ove=
rhead.  For example if I want to send you a vcard mid-call, it seems silly =
to send a re-Invite to add an MSRP session, potentially go get msrp-relay i=
nfo to do so, and/or possibly go through ICE procedures, all just to send y=
ou a 100 byte little vcard I could have sent in an INFO.  But clearly if I =
need to send you a 10MB file it will be appropriate.  My 2 cents anyway.

For example if I want to send you a vcard mid-call, it seems silly to send a re-Invite to add an MSRP session, potentially go get msrp-relay info to do so, and/or possibly go through ICE procedures, all just to send you a 100 byte little vcard I could have sent in an INFO.  But clearly if I need to send you a 10MB file it will be appropriate.  My 2 cents anyway.

Yes, I agree. In some cases even though it is a rediculous amount of 
overhead it just won't matter and will be the right thing to do anyway 
if the infrastructure is there to do it. In other cases that isn't so. 
I'm certainly open to some uses for INFO or for more marginal uses of 
MESSAGE.

Especially if we go ahead with this INFO enhancement I think we need to 
draw the line carefully between INFO and MESSAGE.

These 3 use cases below seem misuse of INFO as there are established =
mechanism of doing these using non-INFO way.

into it, but you're right I should have included that use-case.  Sorry!

	Dear folks,
	 How about the Midcall INFO ?
	 When 'Hook-Flash' from the SIP or POTS phone during a dialogue, we =
(KT) use INFO method from the CSCF/MGCF to AS.
	 I submitted a draft I-D two years ago but it was not accepted,
	But we still use the case.
	 Can it be another Use-Case ?

	=C1=A6=B8=F1: [Sip] INFO use-cases
=09
=09
	Howdy,
	Jonathan asked for use-cases for what types of things would need an =
in-dialog SIP message for user-user communication, vs. should be done =
either out of dialog or in the media plane.  If the only use-case is =
DTMF, then we could just document the DTMF negotiation/use only and not =
have to create a general info-events framework.  That seems a very =
reasonable argument to me.  I also don't want to do work for no use.
=09
	There is a counter-argument that there are proprietary uses of INFO in =
the wild, and that a framework for negotiation at least removes the =
manual configuration of vendor-specific profiles, which is a problem of =
interop today - even if the IETF should not bless/document the specific =
use cases themselves.  But that would make the draft a very different =
one than it currently is as well, and I will ask that in a separate =
email thread.
=09
	The chairs have asked for 3 use cases, and I assume they mean 3 NEW use =
cases (we already have 3 RFCs which use INFO, as well as DTMF).  I am =
not sure if they mean potential future use-cases, or current use-cases =
(i.e., already implemented).  Can I get a clarification on that?
=09
	So anyway, taking the shot-gun approach, here's a first go at some =
use-cases, and my personal take on whether they should be in INFO vs. =
SUB/NOT vs. media-plane, FWIW.
	[apologize for formatting ugliness]
=09
	/***************
	*  Already standardized use-cases:
	***************/
	1) SIP-T/ISUP/QSIG/PSTN
	        -Documented in RFC 3372 and RFC 4497.
=09
	2) ECMA TR/87 uaCSTA
	        -Uses INFO to send ECMA-323 XML for monitoring and controlling =
phones from a PC.
=09
	3) Sending media server control commands.
	        -Documented in RFC4722 MSCML.
=09
=09
	/****************
	*  Use-cases that I think are potentially/possibly valid for INFO:
	****************/
	1) Sending a vcard asynchronously.  Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can =
you send me John's vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.
	        -Alternatives: send a re-Invite or Update with a Call-Info, =
with either a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL.
	        -Counter-argument: IMO this type of data really belongs in MIME =
for a number of reasons, including length is less restricted for mime =
attachments; one AD has said the Data URL may be deprecated.  And =
sending a re-Invite for this purpose seems odd.
=09
	        -Also, the Call-Info header is really about the caller or =
callee, and thus Bob shouldn't be sending me John's vcard info in it =
technically.  That may sound like a nit, but UA's may well store the =
call-info vcards into their address-books automatically and so tie it to =
the wrong user/call.
	        -Pros of using INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you =
send the vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, =
and you can send it based on user input.
=09
	2) Sending a user-icon jpeg/bitmap/gif.  Alice calls Bob, Bob has an =
icon that represents himself, sends it when he picks up the phone.
	        -Alternatives: send a 200ok, re-Invite, or Update with =
call-info, which explicitly has a type for icon.
	        -Counter-argument: same as for vcard, plus with call-info there =
is no way to know which picture format the far-end supports a priori.  =
With a supported-package negotiation one could know.
=09
	3) Sending a vcalendar-type invitation.  Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey =
let's have a con call at time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a =
vcalendar..
	        -Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or not and =
thus whether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or not is =
certainly debatable.  Message method can already be used for this =
anyway.
=09
	4) Sending an HTTP URL.  Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for =
more info or a datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her =
web-browser.
	        -One could also argue this is just making SIP the new SMTP, or =
this should be sent using MESSAGE (which really is the new SMTP).
=09
	5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice =
does a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info =
with an incrementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not =
really max-forwards), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.
	        -It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, SBCs) would =
ever allow this type of thing to happen, due to security concerns, but I =
think they may do it at domain boundary hops.  I think this is a =
reasonable use for INFO though, maybe.
=09
	6) Sending geo-location information after call establishment.  Alice =
calls Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for directions to hotel, =
clicks button and sends him location info of her phone (or Bob clicks =
button and sends her his location).
	        -The location conveyance draft specifically calls out INFO as =
acceptable for geo-loc info.  Whether this is a real use-case is =
debatable, and obviously it could be done with a sub/not.
=09
	7) Sending softkey-labels (not digit-match maps, but rather softkey =
button labels).  Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends =
softkey-labels for the menu items available in the response, Alice =
presses softkeys and sends them in INFO.
	        -This could (and maybe should) be done with sub/not, a la KPML, =
where the vmail server sends the softkey labels in the Subscribe, UA =
sends buttons pressed in Notifies.  But this is similar to the DTMF use =
case so may well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons =
are rarely pressed.
=09
	8) Sending a screen-pop-up message, e.g., "Do you want to continue with =
this session?"
	        -There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  I =
guess Alert-Info could be used for this, but it's not clear it should?
=09
=09
	/*****************
	*  Use-cases which have been proposed by others or even implemented,
	*  which are dubious for INFO (IMHO):
	*****************/
	1) Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call.
	        -There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the =
signaling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media plane =
box that gets RTCP.  Again this could (and IMO should) be done with =
sub/not, so it can get stats after the call is over, and since it will =
probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be =
dwarfed by the number of Notifies.
=09
	2) Sending access-location information after call establishment.
	        -There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have =
proposed to send an update for it as a phone roams access points or =
cells.  But I think this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite session, =
vs. in a sub/not or Register (and besides half the time the network =
inserts this header, not the UA).
=09
	3) Sending media-control indications (ie, remote-control =
"play/pause/etc.")
	        -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if =
it's the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, =
except at a media content layer above RTP, so not done in RTCP nor SDP.
=09
	4) Sending video fast update command
	        -This is an informational draft, which documents what has been =
implemented, but states it should really be done in the media plane.
=09
	5) Sending peripheral control commands (ie, USB commands)
	        -There is actually a patent on this, amazingly.  Someone thinks =
it makes sense to create a SIP session to your laptop, or vice-versa, =
and then send USB commands inside MIME in INFO messages.  Methinks this =
should be media-plane, if anything.
=09
	6) Sending charging information for a call (i.e., minutes remaining or =
cost so far).
	        -There was a proposal to use this for Advice of Charge =
information in TISPAN.  IMO it should be a sub/not though, as they want =
this to survive the Invite session.

Howdy,=0A=
Jonathan asked for use-cases for what types of things would need an =
in-dialog SIP message for user-user communication, vs. should be done =
either out of dialog or in the media plane.  If the only use-case is =
DTMF, then we could just document the DTMF negotiation/use only and not =
have to create a general info-events framework.  That seems a very =
reasonable argument to me.  I also don't want to do work for no use.=0A=
=0A=
There is a counter-argument that there are proprietary uses of INFO in =
the wild, and that a framework for negotiation at least removes the =
manual configuration of vendor-specific profiles, which is a problem of =
interop today - even if the IETF should not bless/document the specific =
use cases themselves.  But that would make the draft a very different =
one than it currently is as well, and I will ask that in a separate =
email thread.=0A=
=0A=
The chairs have asked for 3 use cases, and I assume they mean 3 NEW use =
cases (we already have 3 RFCs which use INFO, as well as DTMF).  I am =
not sure if they mean potential future use-cases, or current use-cases =
(i.e., already implemented).  Can I get a clarification on that?=0A=
=0A=
So anyway, taking the shot-gun approach, here's a first go at some =
use-cases, and my personal take on whether they should be in INFO vs. =
SUB/NOT vs. media-plane, FWIW.=0A=
[apologize for formatting ugliness]=0A=
=0A=
/***************=0A=
*  Already standardized use-cases:=0A=
***************/=0A=
1) SIP-T/ISUP/QSIG/PSTN=0A=
        -Documented in RFC 3372 and RFC 4497.=0A=
=0A=
2) ECMA TR/87 uaCSTA=0A=
        -Uses INFO to send ECMA-323 XML for monitoring and controlling =
phones from a PC.=0A=
=0A=
3) Sending media server control commands.=0A=
        -Documented in RFC4722 MSCML.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
/****************=0A=
*  Use-cases that I think are potentially/possibly valid for INFO:=0A=
****************/=0A=
1) Sending a vcard asynchronously.  Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can you =
send me John's vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.=0A=
        -Alternatives: send a re-Invite or Update with a Call-Info, with =
either a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL.=0A=
        -Counter-argument: IMO this type of data really belongs in MIME =
for a number of reasons, including length is less restricted for mime =
attachments; one AD has said the Data URL may be deprecated.  And =
sending a re-Invite for this purpose seems odd.=0A=
=0A=
        -Also, the Call-Info header is really about the caller or =
callee, and thus Bob shouldn't be sending me John's vcard info in it =
technically.  That may sound like a nit, but UA's may well store the =
call-info vcards into their address-books automatically and so tie it to =
the wrong user/call.=0A=
        -Pros of using INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you =
send the vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, =
and you can send it based on user input.=0A=
=0A=
2) Sending a user-icon jpeg/bitmap/gif.  Alice calls Bob, Bob has an =
icon that represents himself, sends it when he picks up the phone.=0A=
        -Alternatives: send a 200ok, re-Invite, or Update with =
call-info, which explicitly has a type for icon.=0A=
        -Counter-argument: same as for vcard, plus with call-info there =
is no way to know which picture format the far-end supports a priori.  =
With a supported-package negotiation one could know.=0A=
=0A=
3) Sending a vcalendar-type invitation.  Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey =
let's have a con call at time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a =
vcalendar..=0A=
        -Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or not and thus =
whether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or not is certainly =
debatable.  Message method can already be used for this anyway.=0A=
=0A=
4) Sending an HTTP URL.  Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for =
more info or a datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her =
web-browser.=0A=
        -One could also argue this is just making SIP the new SMTP, or =
this should be sent using MESSAGE (which really is the new SMTP).=0A=
=0A=
5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice =
does a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info =
with an incrementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not =
really max-forwards), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.=0A=
        -It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, SBCs) would =
ever allow this type of thing to happen, due to security concerns, but I =
think they may do it at domain boundary hops.  I think this is a =
reasonable use for INFO though, maybe.=0A=
=0A=
6) Sending geo-location information after call establishment.  Alice =
calls Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for directions to hotel, =
clicks button and sends him location info of her phone (or Bob clicks =
button and sends her his location).=0A=
        -The location conveyance draft specifically calls out INFO as =
acceptable for geo-loc info.  Whether this is a real use-case is =
debatable, and obviously it could be done with a sub/not.=0A=
=0A=
7) Sending softkey-labels (not digit-match maps, but rather softkey =
button labels).  Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends =
softkey-labels for the menu items available in the response, Alice =
presses softkeys and sends them in INFO.=0A=
        -This could (and maybe should) be done with sub/not, a la KPML, =
where the vmail server sends the softkey labels in the Subscribe, UA =
sends buttons pressed in Notifies.  But this is similar to the DTMF use =
case so may well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons =
are rarely pressed.=0A=
=0A=
8) Sending a screen-pop-up message, e.g., "Do you want to continue with =
this session?"=0A=
        -There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  I guess =
Alert-Info could be used for this, but it's not clear it should?=0A=

=0A=
/*****************=0A=

1) Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call.=0A=

probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be =
dwarfed by the number of Notifies.=0A=
=0A=
2) Sending access-location information after call establishment.=0A=
        -There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have proposed =
to send an update for it as a phone roams access points or cells.  But I =
think this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite session, vs. in a =

=0A=
3) Sending media-control indications (ie, remote-control =

        -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if =
it's the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, =

4) Sending video fast update command=0A=

6) Sending charging information for a call (i.e., minutes remaining or =

Hi,

Just to clarify, when we talk about MESSAGE I assume we do allow it to =
be used within the invite dialog if appropriate (RFC3428 does allow it)?

Yes, I agree. In some cases even though it is a rediculous amount of
overhead it just won't matter and will be the right thing to do anyway
if the infrastructure is there to do it. In other cases that isn't so.
I'm certainly open to some uses for INFO or for more marginal uses of
MESSAGE.

Especially if we go ahead with this INFO enhancement I think we need to
draw the line carefully between INFO and MESSAGE.

Using it in support of an existing dialog should be fine.

Hi,
=20
I guess the MSRP overhead issue applies also to other cases where there =
may be some small amount of data sent at some point during the session. =
User-to-user information is one example.
=20
But, I fully agree that INFO shall not be used for sending 10MB of data.
=20

Yes, I agree. In some cases even though it is a rediculous amount of
overhead it just won't matter and will be the right thing to do anyway
if the infrastructure is there to do it. In other cases that isn't so.
I'm certainly open to some uses for INFO or for more marginal uses of
MESSAGE.

Especially if we go ahead with this INFO enhancement I think we need to
draw the line carefully between INFO and MESSAGE.

Hi,
=20
Use-case 1:
-----------------
=20
One use-case is the transport of user-to-user information, and the =
reasons people don't think it's feasible to establish a media plane =
connection for this are (at least):
=20
1. The information will not be sent for every call, and when sent the =
amount of information is relatively small
2. In interworking cases the information may be received out-of-band =
from the "other side", so it is seen as unfeasible to send it down to =
the MG - in some cases the interworking may even be performed without a =
MG.
=20
=20
Use-case 2:
-----------------
=20
Pretty much the same arguments are also used for sending DTMF =
out-of-band. In addition there may be intermediate entities, without =
media access, which are interested in the DTMF information.
=20
=20
(I hope we have understood the arguments why people want to use INFO =
instead of SUB/NOT, so I will not go into that again.)
=20
Regards,
=20
Christer

Subject: [Sip] INFO use-cases



Howdy,
Jonathan asked for use-cases for what types of things would need an =
in-dialog SIP message for user-user communication, vs. should be done =
either out of dialog or in the media plane.  If the only use-case is =
DTMF, then we could just document the DTMF negotiation/use only and not =
have to create a general info-events framework.  That seems a very =
reasonable argument to me.  I also don't want to do work for no use.

There is a counter-argument that there are proprietary uses of INFO in =
the wild, and that a framework for negotiation at least removes the =
manual configuration of vendor-specific profiles, which is a problem of =
interop today - even if the IETF should not bless/document the specific =
use cases themselves.  But that would make the draft a very different =
one than it currently is as well, and I will ask that in a separate =
email thread.

The chairs have asked for 3 use cases, and I assume they mean 3 NEW use =
cases (we already have 3 RFCs which use INFO, as well as DTMF).  I am =
not sure if they mean potential future use-cases, or current use-cases =
(i.e., already implemented).  Can I get a clarification on that?

So anyway, taking the shot-gun approach, here's a first go at some =
use-cases, and my personal take on whether they should be in INFO vs. =
SUB/NOT vs. media-plane, FWIW.
[apologize for formatting ugliness]

/***************
*  Already standardized use-cases:
***************/
1) SIP-T/ISUP/QSIG/PSTN
        -Documented in RFC 3372 and RFC 4497.

2) ECMA TR/87 uaCSTA
        -Uses INFO to send ECMA-323 XML for monitoring and controlling =
phones from a PC.

3) Sending media server control commands.
        -Documented in RFC4722 MSCML.


/****************
*  Use-cases that I think are potentially/possibly valid for INFO:
****************/
1) Sending a vcard asynchronously.  Alice calls Bob, Alice says "can you =
send me John's vcard?", Bob clicks something and voila it's sent.
        -Alternatives: send a re-Invite or Update with a Call-Info, with =
either a URL reference, data URI, or MIME and CID URL.
        -Counter-argument: IMO this type of data really belongs in MIME =
for a number of reasons, including length is less restricted for mime =
attachments; one AD has said the Data URL may be deprecated.  And =
sending a re-Invite for this purpose seems odd.
        -Also, the Call-Info header is really about the caller or =
callee, and thus Bob shouldn't be sending me John's vcard info in it =
technically.  That may sound like a nit, but UA's may well store the =
call-info vcards into their address-books automatically and so tie it to =
the wrong user/call.
        -Pros of using INFO: it's explicit what you're doing when you =
send the vcard, and you can send it knowing the other end can accept it, =
and you can send it based on user input.

2) Sending a user-icon jpeg/bitmap/gif.  Alice calls Bob, Bob has an =
icon that represents himself, sends it when he picks up the phone.
        -Alternatives: send a 200ok, re-Invite, or Update with =
call-info, which explicitly has a type for icon.
        -Counter-argument: same as for vcard, plus with call-info there =
is no way to know which picture format the far-end supports a priori.  =
With a supported-package negotiation one could know.

3) Sending a vcalendar-type invitation.  Alice calls Bob, Bob says "hey =
let's have a con call at time X", clicks and voila his phone sends a =
vcalendar.
        -Whether the vcalendar is related to the session or not and thus =
whether it should be sent in an in-dialog request or not is certainly =
debatable.  Message method can already be used for this anyway.

4) Sending an HTTP URL.  Alice calls Bob, a sales guy; Alice asks for =
more info or a datasheet and Bob sends a URL for Alice to open with her =
web-browser.
        -One could also argue this is just making SIP the new SMTP, or =
this should be sent using MESSAGE (which really is the new SMTP).

5) Sending a session traceroute.  Alice calls Bob, Bob answers, Alice =
does a sip-traceroute to figure out the path to Bob, by sending Info =
with an incrementing max-forwards type header starting at 0 (but not =
really max-forwards), with a sip-frag type response body or some such.
        -It's debatable if certain types of B2BUA's (ie, SBCs) would =
ever allow this type of thing to happen, due to security concerns, but I =
think they may do it at domain boundary hops.  I think this is a =
reasonable use for INFO though, maybe.

6) Sending geo-location information after call establishment.  Alice =
calls Bob, a hotel receptionist.  Alice asks for directions to hotel, =
clicks button and sends him location info of her phone (or Bob clicks =
button and sends her his location).
        -The location conveyance draft specifically calls out INFO as =
acceptable for geo-loc info.  Whether this is a real use-case is =
debatable, and obviously it could be done with a sub/not.

7) Sending softkey-labels (not digit-match maps, but rather softkey =
button labels).  Alice calls her vmail server.  Vmail server sends =
softkey-labels for the menu items available in the response, Alice =
presses softkeys and sends them in INFO.
        -This could (and maybe should) be done with sub/not, a la KPML, =
where the vmail server sends the softkey labels in the Subscribe, UA =
sends buttons pressed in Notifies.  But this is similar to the DTMF use =
case so may well have the same benefit of lower overhead since buttons =
are rarely pressed.

8) Sending a screen-pop-up message, e.g., "Do you want to continue with =
this session?"
        -There is a patent for doing screen pop-ups using INFO.  I guess =
Alert-Info could be used for this, but it's not clear it should?


/*****************
*  Use-cases which have been proposed by others or even implemented,
*  which are dubious for INFO (IMHO):
*****************/
1) Sending RTP/RTCP statistics during call.
        -There is an implementation of this, and the rationale is the =
signaling plane box that wants this info is not actually the media plane =
box that gets RTCP.  Again this could (and IMO should) be done with =
sub/not, so it can get stats after the call is over, and since it will =
probably want periodic reports the overhead of the Subscribe should be =
dwarfed by the number of Notifies.

2) Sending access-location information after call establishment.
        -There is a P-Access-Network-Info header, and some have proposed =
to send an update for it as a phone roams access points or cells.  But I =
think this is an odd thing to do inside an Invite session, vs. in a =
sub/not or Register (and besides half the time the network inserts this =
header, not the UA).

3) Sending media-control indications (ie, remote-control =
"play/pause/etc.")
        -This is done today by at least one vendor, but is debatable if =
it's the right model.  The argument is it's like SDP re-Invite for hold, =
except at a media content layer above RTP, so not done in RTCP nor SDP.

4) Sending video fast update command
        -This is an informational draft, which documents what has been =
implemented, but states it should really be done in the media plane.

5) Sending peripheral control commands (ie, USB commands)
        -There is actually a patent on this, amazingly.  Someone thinks =
it makes sense to create a SIP session to your laptop, or vice-versa, =
and then send USB commands inside MIME in INFO messages.  Methinks this =
should be media-plane, if anything.

6) Sending charging information for a call (i.e., minutes remaining or =
cost so far).
        -There was a proposal to use this for Advice of Charge =
information in TISPAN.  IMO it should be a sub/not though, as they want =
this to survive the Invite session.

   From: Jonathan Rosenberg <jdrosen@cisco.com>

   This strikes me as a problem in theory and not in practice. AFAICT, =
the
   only characters you can't use are ascii 0x00-0x19 (0x20 is space and =
is
   possible through the LWS construct as Christer pointed out). Is there =
a
   practical use case for any of these? They are:

HT (horizontal tab) should be included, but that's also in LWS.  As
for the remaining characters, I don't think that anyone has ever
*intended* that they be used in SIP headers, and their inclusion in
quoted-pair was a typographical error.

I'm certainly not going to claim that Section 11 of RFC4474, or my older =
work in RFC3824, adequately describes the situation with telephone =
numbers in SIP today. The sentence you highlight below was intended to =
suggest that the appearance of telephone numbers as the user part of a =
SIP URI, rather than as a bare TEL URI with no host portion, constitutes =
the "majority of cases". It was not making a statement either way about =
whether or not SBCs are involved in the majority of calls. The guidance =
given in RFC4474 for signing such telephony-related SIP URIs for =
Identity is obviously non-optimal when an intermediary such as an SBC =
must modify content covered by the signature, but of course, that is =
also true for all the rest of the guidance in RFC4474.

My primary concern in the microphone discussion was to separate out the =
difficulties of managing telephone numbers in this context from (in my =
perspective) the unrelated and excessive dilution of necessary security =
properties which was proposed to accommodate SBCs.

The following rfc3261 section 20 text defines when a name-addr must be
used instead of an addr-spec.  However the text currently does not
appear generic enough to apply to all headers.

RFC 3261 section 20: "The Contact, From, and To header fields contain a
URI.  If the URI contains a comma, question mark or semicolon, the URI
MUST be enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).  Any URI parameters are
contained within these brackets.  If the URI is not enclosed in angle
brackets, any semicolon-delimited parameters are header-parameters, not
URI parameters."

RFC 3515 does not mention the rfc3261 rules.  RFC 4508 only mentions the
parameter impacts.

Does the rfc3261 rule concerning comma and question mark apply to the
refer-to header? =20

Does the rfc3261 rule apply to all sip headers defined as containing
name-addr or addr-spec?  And if so, should the text be update per
sip-essential-correction process?

If comma and question mark aspects of the rfc3261 text is not relevant
Refer-To, what is reason for the difference?

Thanks,
Brett

That language is intended to apply to any uses of name-addr.
There's a closely related bug captured already: http://bugs.sipit.net/

Yeah, but I think we do have to recognize there really are use cases that a=
re simply wrong to do using INFO.  There's nothing the IETF or anyone can d=
o to stop people from doing them (there's no RFC interpol), but that doesn'=
t mean we should give them explicit blessing either, and a draft such as Er=
ic's really is the best we can do if we can't find legitimate use cases.  T=
hat's why I like Jonathan's proposal for finding good use-cases, which is w=
hat I wanted to say at the mic at the end of that debate.

There is, though, another aspect to this.  As we all know, interoperability=
 is a major SIP issue, and even if we discourage INFO use we know it will b=
e used.  So an unresolved question in my mind is whether we should define a=
t least how such proprietary use can be signaled, to avoid vendor-specific =
static configuration profile proliferation making interop harder.  In other=
 words: not accept draft proposals for INFO use, not be bothered with repea=
ting these discussions anymore in the IETF, etc.; but at least give them a =
standardized way to negotiate it so their UAs can interoperate with legitim=
ate IETF-following UAs without needing configuration.

In regard to your use case 1, then if we follow the Alan Johnston draft, =
this would be a header being transported rather than a body, whereas all =
the cases we have been discussing so far have been message body =
transport issues. If you mean something different, then it would be =
probably be better to use a different term that "user to user".

(As WG chair)

This document has a somewhat complicated history, in that we completed
it once in the WG and sent it to the IESG, but it came back from them
because of concerns over security issues.

The editor's have now followed the instructions from the previous
meeting, i.e. to:

      Integrated Max-Breadth based on working group discussion of the
      secdir review

      Added a paragraph pointing out that removing or modifying other
      node's branch parameters defeats their ability to loop detect

      Moved the total number of messages from O(2^70) to O(2^71) based
      on an observation by Jan Kolomaznik.  To see this, note that the
      total number of requests is the sum from i=3D0 to Max-Forwards of
      2^i which is 2^(Max-Forwards+1) - 1.  The point of the text
      doesn't change - (the point being that the number is _big_).

      Made the new 4xx concrete (choosing 440)

      Added a sentence reinforcing that if you forward to only one
      branch, you still potentially have a constant multiplier of
      messages in the network as Max-Forwards runs out (based on
      feedback from Thomas Cross.)

These changes are significant enough to justify a revised WGLC, and I
would therefore like the working group to review the document and
provide comments to the SIP list and authors by=20

	Friday 21st December 2007.=20

It would be appropriate to concentrate on the text with the changes
identified about.

The document may be found at:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06.txt

And the wdiff document may be found at:

http://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?difftype=3D--hwdiff&url2=3Dhttp://tools.iet=
f.o
rg/id/draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-06.txt

[Note that unfortunately this identifies a significant portion of text
as new text, when it fact it merely moved.]

Regards

Keith

I agree completely. There are arguably some good uses for INFO, and  
very likely there will be people who choose to do very silly things  
with it. I really don't want to waste SIP working group time deciding  
which are which. I just want to set up a framework that keeps all  
these uses, good or bad, silly or ingenious, from stepping on each  
other.

The only question in my mind is whether the registry for INFO package  
names should be "specification required" or "First come, first served".

The IPv6 mobility topic would likely be beyond intended purpose of the
draft.

Your question would potentially be relevant to
draft-ietf-sipping-v6-transition. =20

If IPv6 mobility has impacts upon SIP which have not been analyzed
within SIPPING or another working group, the community would likely
welcome the analysis even if it doesn't produce new SIP related
requirements.

Thanks,
Brett

Sorry I should have clarified - meant that just as a general comment, but p=
artly because I thought you were saying anything fitting into your use-case=
-1 would qualify as legitimate use.
I didn't mean to imply you weren't in agreement. :)

Jonathan,

Thanks for taking care of most of my review comments. The following is
outstanding:

"As such, this document formally defines a
   "SIP specification" as:

   o  Any specification that defines an extension to RFC 3261, where an
      extension is a mechanism that changes or updates in some way a
      behavior specified there."
This means RFC 3261 is not a SIP specification! Suggest:
"The basic SIP specification, RFC 3261 [RFC3261], or any specification
that defines an extension to RFC 3261..."

John

Hi,

I'm a bit confused about which is the correct behavior for the CANCEL response handling with regard to the To-tag. There seems to be contradiction between RFC3261 and RFC3665. 

Here's the scenario: (as stated in RFC3665, section: 3.8)


   Alice           Proxy 1          Proxy 2            Bob
     |                |                |                |
     |   INVITE F1    |                |                |
     |--------------->|   INVITE F2    |                |
     |     100  F3    |--------------->|   INVITE F4    |
     |<---------------|     100  F5    |--------------->|
     |                |<---------------|                |
     |                |                |      180 F6    |
     |                |     180 F7     |<---------------|
     |     180 F8     |<---------------|                |

Questions:

1) All the 200 OK for the CANCEL responses do not contain any To-tags. But according to RFC3261 section 16.10, a stateful proxy should act as a UAS, which then require the response to have a To-tag. Isn't it?

2) Assume that CANCEL response should contain a To-tag, then what tag should it use? The same one as in the 180 response, which then should match the 487 response for INVITE as well?

3) If the proxy never received any provisional response, except for 100 trying, meaning it has not received any To-tag, then when it received the CANCEL request, should it generate a local To-tag in the response? 

4) And since RFC3261 only stated that the To-tag in the CANCEL response SHOULD, not MUST, matches the one in the 487 response, I suppose it is OK to pass the 487 response from the UAS (Bob) towards the UAC (Alice) without changing the To-tag to match the one in the CANCEL response?

Hope someone could clarify it. Thanks for your time.

Best Regards,
Tonny

Hi,<br><br>I'm a bit confused about which is the correct behavior for the CANCEL response handling with regard to the To-tag.

This is an error in RFC 3665. All final responses must have to-tag.

The UAS should use the same to-tag for the 200-OK to the CANCEL that it use=
d in the 180, and that same to-tag should be used in the 487 response for t=
he INVITE. As it says in section 9.2 of RFC 3261 :

   ....the UAS answers the CANCEL
   request itself with a 200 (OK) response.  This response is
   constructed following the procedures described in Section 8.2.6
   noting that the To tag of the response to the CANCEL and the To tag
   in the response to the original request SHOULD be the same.

>3) If the proxy never received any provisional response,
> except for 100 trying, meaning it has not received any To-tag,

Yes. The CANCEL is hop-by-hop and each proxy is responding as a UAS, so it =
generates its own to-tag. If it previously forwarded a 1xx response with a =
to-tag, it may use that to-tag.

Yes. Proxies should not change the to-tag in a response it is proxies back =
toward the UAC (see page 110 of RFC 3261).

   From: "Brett Tate" <brett@broadsoft.com>

   The following rfc3261 section 20 text defines when a name-addr must be
   used instead of an addr-spec.  However the text currently does not
   appear generic enough to apply to all headers.

   RFC 3261 section 20: "The Contact, From, and To header fields contain a
   URI.  If the URI contains a comma, question mark or semicolon, the URI
   MUST be enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).  Any URI parameters are
   contained within these brackets.  If the URI is not enclosed in angle
   brackets, any semicolon-delimited parameters are header-parameters, not
   URI parameters."

   RFC 3515 does not mention the rfc3261 rules.  RFC 4508 only mentions the
   parameter impacts.

   Does the rfc3261 rule concerning comma and question mark apply to the
   refer-to header?  

   Does the rfc3261 rule apply to all sip headers defined as containing
   name-addr or addr-spec?  And if so, should the text be update per
   sip-essential-correction process?

   If comma and question mark aspects of the rfc3261 text is not relevant
   Refer-To, what is reason for the difference?

The shortest statement of the real rule is "In locations where the
grammar allows either name-addr or addr-spec to appear, the following
restriction applies:  If the URI contains a comma, question mark or
semicolon, the name-addr form must be used."  This rule covers all
extension headers, etc., because it is necessary to disambiguate
"name-addr / addr-spec".

As you can see from section 2.1 of RFC 3515, Refer-To allows both
name-addr and addr-spec and so is subject to this disambiguation rule.

I've overstated things above -- the restriction is needed to
disambiguate appearances of semicolon.  The restriction in regard to
comma is needed to disambiguate uses of addr-spec in lists.  The
restriction in regard to question mark doesn't seem to be needed for
disambiguation -- I wonder why it's there.

Dale

Hi,

      For example, a SIP message has the following SDP:

      v=0
      c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0
      t=2873397496 2873404696
      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
      a=sendonly

   I would like to know whether a=sendonly or c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0 should take
into effect in this particular case.

   From RFC 4566:
   ============

   Section 5, Page 8 mentions the following:

   An SDP session description consists of a session-level section
   followed by zero or more media-level sections.  The session-level
   part starts with a "v=" line and continues to the first media-level
   section.  Each media-level section starts with an "m=" line and
   continues to the next media-level section or end of the whole session
   description.  In general, session-level values are the default for
   all media unless overridden by an equivalent media-level value.


  Section 5, Page 10 mentions the following:

   [The connection ("c=") and attribute ("a=") information in the
   session-level section applies to all the media of that session unless
   overridden by connection information or an attribute of the same name
   in the media description.]

   I find the above statements to be slightly contradictory.

   Please clarify.

Thanks,
Jagan

Hi,
=20
I have had an off-line discussion with Jonathan about this, but I'll let =
everyone else know too.
=20
One issue with Jonathan's proposed mechanism is that it is assumes that =
the entity/proxy who wants to use it (instead of modifying the R-URI =
value) KNOWS whether the next hop device also supports the mechanism or =
not. I think that assumption makes the usability of the proposed =
solution extremely limited and "undynamic", and services which rely on =
the mechanism will be dependent on whether intermediates (which have =
nothing to do with the service as such) support the mechanism
=20
Also, assuming that one or more entities/proxies in the path have =
already used the mechanism, and now an entity/proxy realizes that the =
next hop device does NOT support it. This most likely means that that =
entity/proxy now will have to "fix" the INVITE (e.g put the "correct" =
URI back into the R-URI etc), in order for the next hop to be able to =
deal with it correctly (at least the home proxy of the terminating user =
would need the "fix" in order to find the registered contact, and an MGC =
to correctly map the called party number).
=20
And, yes, I AM thinking about an alternative solution, and my intention =
IS to submit a draft before the deadline.
=20
Regards,
=20
Christer

For when a proxy is talking to a registered UA, yes.

That is not the intent.

The idea is, any proxy that is translating a request-URI, is doing so
based on some kind of mapping table. There are many ways that this
mapping table can get into the proxy:

1. dynamically through register
2. provisioned
3. through an enum query
etc.

If we take provisioning as an example (i.e., someone enters phone number
routing rules via prefix matching rules), when those rules are
provisioned, they would include a flag which says whether the
destination is loose-route compliant. If they are loose route compliant,
the proxy uses a Route header, else it uses r-uri translation as is
currently done.

As above, no.

Yes.

Hopefully the above paragraph answers your question.

Hi,

I was wondering how is Buddy List be exchanged between SIP Server and SIP
UA. Can someone please direct me to some document in relate to this.

Thank you,

Hi all,

I know this is a SIP dedicated mail list and not designed for IMS
related questions but I do not know where else I could post.

I would like to check my understanding of Early and Late media also
know as Early (or Late) operating mode:

- Using Early media, the inviting user may talk immediately, and the
core network should buffer the media before the invited user (or
users) accept the session
- The received media is buffered until at least the first invited user
accepts the invitation
- The buffered media is also sent to all users that accept the invitation
- Conversely, Late media mimics a traditional phone call where the
inviting user must wait until at least one inviting user accepts the
session before being allowed to send media

Is my understanding correct? Are any of the dot points in error?

Thanks in advance,

Simon

Hadriel,

Thanks much for putting down some use cases. These are helpful for a 
good discussion.

Some comments below, but I will say that I'm now convinced that we 
should go ahead and define an info-framework. The real compelling 
argument, I think, is one you make below. Even if we tell everyone they 
shouldn't, its clear that folks are going to be doing this. So, instead 
of saying no, and leaving us with an non-interoperable mess, lets define 
how it works, and give some guidance on what the issues are and when you 
might want to step back and think about whether something else (SUB/NOT, 
media plane, MESSAGE) would be a better choice.

It is very reminiscent of the NAT discussion. Sure, we all agree NAT is 
bad and it makes things harder for lots of apps, and there are better 
ways (v6). But, the architecturally right thing was not as easily 
deployable as the quick-fix NAT solution, and so the latter won out. In 
hindsight, we would have been much better off had we immediately 
standardized clear behaviors for NAT, and not ignored them and just 
declared them bad.

INFO is the same. Sure, there'll often be better ways. But folks have 
spoken with their implementations, that it is more easily deployable 
than any of the other solutions. So lets not re-do the NAT mistake, lets 
define how it works, and not just say 'they're bad', and then end up 
regretting it in a few years when there are hundreds of INFO usages out 
there.

More below:

That argument is bogus since RFC 3261 clearly says call-info is about 
the caller or callee:

    The Call-Info header field provides additional information about the
    caller or callee, depending on whether it is found in a request or
    response.

There is also a purpose parameter (a close cousin to the info-event, 
I'll note), which is specifically about vcard.

That said, I agree data URI is bad so the real use case for call-info is 
when the vcard is to be sent by indirection. But its clear that 
indirection is much more of a pain than just sending the darn thing; you 
need to store it somewhere, get a URL, and then make sure that URL is 
derefenceable from the target, figure out when its retrieved, and then 
delete the content once retrieved at some point. Thats clearly a lot 
harder than just including it.

Another alternative would be MESSAGE, but I think thats wrong. The 
reason is that MESSAGE should only be used when the one and only purpose 
of the content is to *render*. A vcard isn't just rendered; one can 
imagine a UA saying to a user, "bob has sent his vcard, would you like 
to add to your contacts?" and that is NOT rendering. So MESSAGE is wrong.

ANother choice is the media channel. I agree here the overhead is high 
for that relative to the size of the content.

So I think this is a reasonable use case in fact.

Well, here I think the arguments are a bit more compelling for a 
media-path channel. This could be big, very possibly bigger than 1500 
bytes, and this puts us into issues with SIP.

Well, I'll disagree with MESSAGE again under the argument that the 
intention here is not to render, but to have some kind of automated 
handling which depends on the purpose of the content (and not just the 
type). But I think this also passes the litmus test for cases where the 
other choices besides INFO are going to add complexity, overhead, or 
latency for no benefit; SUB/NOT is a lot of work when you have no idea 
if you would ever even receive it. Media-path setup would be overly 
complex and a lot of messages for something which is very likely to 
never be sent. The size of these is small, so in the signaling path is 
reasonable.

Well, here we already have something defined - REFER with an http URL. 
See draft-ietf-sipping-app-interaction-framework.

I'm much less convinced here. This would require handling at proxies and 
we haven't been discussing usage of INFO at proxies like this. Only e2e.

SUB/NOT seems a bit better here, I think, since the recipient knows that 
they want it.

Rarely pressed yes, but this is an application specifically looking for 
them. This is squarely in the territory of 
draft-ietf-sipping-app-interaction-framework and is better handled by 
those mechanisms.

See discussion on indirection above. I think this is reasonable for INFO 
also.

Agree SUB/NOT is better. Its already been defined that way.

I think this is much better done via a media-plane session. There is a

get sent.

Agree.

Correction, yes. Essential? Hardly.

This is another question around essential corrections. I think they not 
only need to clearly represent a bug or a fix, but need to be one that 
is important enough to merit documenting. Just like software, sometimes 
you don't ever bother fixing those sev 5s. Ever.

Based on Hadriels use cases, I'd like to suggest some litmus tests that 
one can use to help determine if something is best done by INFO or 
something else:

Cases where a media-plane session is the best solution:

   * there are requirements for low latency delivery (camera control for 
example)

   * there are requirements that the data shouldn't be retransmitted 
since latency trumps reliability (coordinate updates for a pointer on a 
whiteboard or something like that)

   * the data consists of a large number of messages that are likely to 
be sent during the duration of the session

   * the data is potentially very large

Cases where SUB-NOT is the best solution:

   * the entity that wants to receive the data knows with high 
probability that the other side is likely to send a notification with 
the data, and it knows specifically what type of data it needs to receive

   * the entity that wants to receive the data is likely to receive a 
multiplicity of events containing that data

Cases where INFO is the best solution:

   * the recipient of the data has no idea if the sender will ever 
generate the data; the recipient is just saying that it knows how to 
handle it, should the sender have something to send

   * the recipient could potentially handle many different types of data 
with the above characteristic

   * the size of the data that is to be sent is small and infrequent, at 
most a few times during the session

   * the data needs to be sent reliably and latency is not much of an issue

   * the data has no impact on SIP dialog state, transaction state, 
media session states or intermediate proxy or b2bua states

Apparently the data url has been declared politically incorrect.

But an Alert-Info or Call-Info with a CID URI should be quite reasonable 
in cases where you want to include the content in the message. (We just 
have to get settled what the Content-Disposition should be.)

3261 defines both a Call-Info purpose of "icon" and a 
Content-Disposition of "icon" as ways to send a picture of the caller.

Frankly the whole Content-Disposition meaning is still a bit up in the 
air IMO. It may be worth a discussion of what it means to have a content 
disposition other than "render" in a MESSAGE.

Why isn't this a place that where MESSAGE *is* appropriate? Sure seems

Just would like to raise a small warning with the "essential" vs=20
"non-essential" debate... Sometimes the most "costly" bugs (in terms of=20
interoperability problems) are the smallest stupid nits.
Just one example, the FIRST proxy example of the RFC 3665 is broken...=20
Contact of subsequent request is not correctly pushed in the Request URI=20
with transport parameter, so, at SIPIT, I already have seen many UAs
that behave incorrectly because of this... Ok this is clearly written in=20
3261, but you know how developers do: "don't have time to read this long=20
RFC, I will just look at the example :p"... And
the place you generally look at is 3665, and then, it is broken (!)...=20
This is not "fixed" and I assume it will probably never be... By the way=20
this is a question: would it be interesting for somebody to
fix 3665 examples, and if yes, how to proceed?

Jon, Cullen,

In RFC4474 there is an example (page 19):

Identity:
     "ZYNBbHC00VMZr2kZt6VmCvPonWJMGvQTBDqghoWeLxJfzB2a1pxAr3VgrB0SsSAa
      ifsRdiOPoQZYOy2wrVghuhcsMbHWUSFxI6p6q5TOQXHMmz6uEo3svJsSH49thyGn
      FVcnyaZ++yRlBYYQTLqWzJ+KVhPKbfU/pryhVn9Yc6U="

while the ABNF says:

Identity = "Identity" HCOLON signed-identity-digest
   signed-identity-digest = LDQUOT *32LHEX *RDQUOT

"32LHEX" means 32 hex digits in lower case (as used for e.g. 
request-digest in RFC3261), but this does not seem to be the intention here?

Regards,
Jeroen

My opinion is that people who only implement based on examples, without =

If people are too lazy to read 3261 I don't think there is anything IETF =

I agree, but if you don't care about the first example of the most basic 
example of an RFC being broken and not fixed, you should not be 
surprised if interoperability problems occur
with new implementations.. This was the topic of interoperability 
workshop: new implementors seem to all fall in the same "traps".
I just wanted to outline that "small fix" is not synonym of "non-essential".

Hi,

I think this is a good start, but I have some comments:

Media-plane stuff:
------------------

This looks rather ok, but I am not sure I understand the retransmission =
issue. The CSeq will take care of that, won't it?

Or, do you mean that retransmission can delay the information to reach =
the recevier? If so, isn't it covered with the first bullet (low =
latency)?


SUB-NOT vs INFO stuff:
----------------------

For INFO I think we should say that it can be used when the data may be =
sent is associated to the dialog sent within, and is sent only for the =
duration of that dialog  (unless a media-plane session is more =
appropriate for that specific data type, of course).

For INFO I think we should also add cases when there are dialog-path =
intermediates (without media access) interested in the data.

For SUB-NOT I think we should add text about data which is not =
associated to an invite dialog, or not associated to the lifetime of an =
invite dialog.=20


I think that the current SUB-NOT bullets could be applicable to INFO =
also. I don't think we can forget the multiple dialog issue with SUB-NOT =
(which is one of the reasons why people use INFO in the first place). Of =
course that doesn't automatically mean that people are allowed to use =
INFO for anything they could also use SUB-NOT for, but I see no reason =
why INFO can't be used e.g. in cases where it is "very likely that some =
data will be sent" (ISUP is one example, where in many cases nodes will =
know it will be sent).

To me one important difference between INFO and SUB-NOT is, as described =
earlier, whether the data is associated with a specific invite dialog, =
and whether the data will only be sent during the lifetime of that =
invite dialog. If not, SUB-NOT is better.


What do you mean by "multiplicity of events containing that data"?


Regards,

Christer

This is how it should be:

1. I implement RFC3261 (and whatever extensions needed)

3. I send an e-mail to some SIP list, get a reply that there is a bug in =

I agree, but if you don't care about the first example of the most basic
example of an RFC being broken and not fixed, you should not be
surprised if interoperability problems occur
with new implementations.. This was the topic of interoperability
workshop: new implementors seem to all fall in the same "traps".
I just wanted to outline that "small fix" is not synonym of =
"non-essential".

Welcome to one of the most confusing aspects among the many confusing  
aspects of SIP that were introduced by our attempts to compensate for  
the broken signaling model of ISUP. Personally, I think we  
unwittingly introduced a nightmarish level of complexity and should  
have just said "no! If you need two stage signaling, finalize the  
first stage with a 200 OK and then re-INVITE if the SDP changes for  
the second session." But we didn't do that, so we have what we have.

IETF seems to use the terms "early media" and "early session",  
although I'm afraid I don't completely understand the nuances despite  
having struggled with them for many years.  I suspect I don't want to  
understand just because the whole thing hurts my delicate  
sensibilities. I'm told that RFC 3960 is a useful reference for this  
discussion.

Both uses of "early" refer to the transmission of media before  
completion of some phase of the signaling. Sometimes this is mean to  
be "before completion of the offer/answer phase" (that is, after an  
"offer", but before an "answer", and sometimes (as defined in RFC  
3960) before the completion of a final response (generally a 200) to  
an INVITE request.

RFC 3960 uses the following definition:

    Early media refers to media (e.g., audio and video) that is  
exchanged
    before a particular session is accepted by the called user.   
Within a
    dialog, early media occurs from the moment the initial INVITE is  
sent
    until the User Agent Server (UAS) generates a final response.  It  
may
    be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can be generated by the
    caller, the callee, or both.  Typical examples of early media
    generated by the callee are ringing tone and announcements (e.g.,
    queuing status).  Early media generated by the caller typically
    consists of voice commands or dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) tones
    to drive interactive voice response (IVR) systems.

In IETF and general IMS environments (AFAIK), there is no expectation  
that early media will be buffered. Anything not received by a  
listener is expected to be discarded.

However, OMA's Push to talk Over Cellular (POC) specification does  
(or at least did, the last time I looked) allow a predictive mode  
where a POC controller (which is for all practical purposes a SIP  
B2BUA with media handling) can "answer" on behalf of a POC terminal  
with which it has an active relationship. The POC controller then  
buffers media while it activates the radio bearer needed to send the  
media on to the terminating POC client. Since the POC controller has  
effectively "answered" the INVITE request with a terminal response  
and media answer, I don't believe this mode qualifies as "early  
media" by any of the definitions in use around the IETF.

Good luck in sorting this all out.

Dean

Howdy,

The SIP WG chairs asked me to summarize the INFO use-case emails on the SIP=
 WG mailing list into a draft, so people don't need to go through the lengt=
hy emails.  This is not intended to be a long-lasting document, but rather =
something to reference for the INFO discussion at hand.  Also, I realize th=
is is really a SIPPING thing in some ways, but the discussion is due to a S=
IP WG discussion.



A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-sip-info-use-cases-00.txt



My apologies if I did not get everyone's arguments into the draft - just dr=
op me a note for the next rev. (someone's already sent me another use-case =
for a next rev)

Folks: As a follow up to the 1-slide summary Keith was kind
enough to present at the Vancouver IETF, here are some further
notes from the WGLC review done by Dale and Hadriel (thanks!) on
connect-reuse-08.  These notes also include the post WGLC discussion
we had on the mailing list leading to the Vancouver IETF.

If I am grossly mistaken in summarizing any of the points below,
please let me know.  Otherwise, I will prepare for an update to the
draft based on the summary and consensus reached as detailed below.

1) Assume A opens a TCP connection to B. The -08 version had
  prohibited B from using the same TCP connection to send requests
  to A.  The WG appears to think that this should be relaxed; i.e.,
  A MAY accept requests over the connection from B, however, B MUST
  NOT use this connection to send requests to A unless it has some
  way of verifying the identity of that party to the same level of
  assurance as it would have by doing the DNS lookup and establishing
  its own connection.

  In either case, the "alias" parameter will NOT be added by A for
  a TCP transport when it opens a connection to B.

2) Name-based virtual servers (i.e., multiple servers on same
  IP+port) present a challenge for TCP connection reuse, and in such
  scenarios, reuse over TCP is prohibited.

3) Document terminology to clarify terms such as "TCP Connection
  Reuse" and "TCP Connection Sharing" (this input was provided to
  me through private email.)  I will open up a separate thread on
  this to nail down the exact terms and their definitions.

4) Clarify portions of the draft as suggested by Dale, including
  making sure that the reader is not given an impression that the
  "alias table" is mandatory.

I will be working on -09 over the next few weeks.  If your recollection
of the consensus reached does not match the above summary, please
let me know.

Thank you.

Hi: During the WGLC review of connect-reuse-08, I received a
private email requesting that the document contain explanation
of terms being used.  To quote the email:

   > A connection is established, and two things can happen....
   >
   > 1. One end sends multiple messages over the same connection
   > for multiple sessions, where these sessions are sequential.
   > Example: A sends INVITE to B, and all dialog messages for the
   > call sessions traverse the same TCP connection until the BYE
   > and 200 OK BYE is completed, at which time the connection
   > is not torn down but remains up and a subsequent INVITE session
   > is then initiated over the same connection. We had been
   > calling this TCP Connection Reuse.
   >
   > 2. One end sends multiple messages over the same connection
   > for multiple simultaneous sessions. Example: A sends INVITE to
   > B for one call session and then sends another INVITE to B for
   > another call session and so on. Each session is maintained in
   > parallel with the others, and all dialog messages for all
   > sessions traverse the same TCP connection until the BYE and
   > 200 OK BYE is completed for each session. We had been calling
   > this TCP Connection Sharing.
   >
   > These are not just our usages of the terms, but are also being
   > used by our customers as well.

Note that there are existing techniques in SIP to disambiguate
multiple dialogs/sessions arriving on the same TCP stream.  So the
difference between connection reuse and connection sharing is not
tied to whether the sessions are sequential or not.  Rather, the
difference is whether or not the connection can be used to send
requests in the backwards direction.  More specifically,

Connection Reuse: The process of using the same connection to send
  new requests in the backwards direction (i.e., A opens a connection
  to B to send requests, and B uses the same connection to send
  new requests to A.)

Connection sharing: The process of using the same connection to send
  multiple requests on the same connection (and of course, receive
  multiple responses over the connection.)  A shared connection will
  not be reused for requests in the backwards direction.

Comments?  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Other terms to document?

Thanks,

- vijay

> expectation that early media will be buffered. 

Brian Stucker's draft-sipping-stucker-media-path-middleboxes-00 does mention a
situation where queuing can occur with 'latching' (commonly done by SBCs when
they do 'hosted NAT traversal'):

   ...
   13.  Media from the UAS is relayed to the UAC.  It is up to local
        policy at the media relay as to whether or not packets that had
        arrived from the UAS for the UAC are queued or dropped prior to
                                             ^^^^^^
        the UAC's address/port information being updated in step 11.

Regarding the INFO use-case discussion, one comment from people is MESSAGE =
is really for things to be rendered to the user, and not for such things as=
 vcards or vcalendars.  Not that I want to contradict myself on it being a =
valid use-case for INFO, but personally I'm not so sure that vcard/vcalenda=
r is wrong for MESSAGE.  I mean we can argue if sending that type of data i=
s really justification for an "Instant Message" request, but I'm talking mo=
re about whether content that isn't directly rendered to the user can be pu=
t into MESSAGE.

In some ways a vcard/vcalendar *is* being rendered to the user - it's just =
that by definition the content type is formatted in a vcard or vcalendar fo=
rmat and needs to be interpreted, if the app understands it.  Just as, for =
example, a MESSAGE can contain message/cpim when we don't really expect to =
visibly render the message/cpim headers without interpretation.

It just so happens that some applications know a vcard/vcalendar type conte=
nt can be integrated into their contact or calendar program, and bypass "re=
ndering" it directly to the user in visible form.  From a SIP protocol pers=
pective it is still user "data" for "rendering".

Keith has been kind enough to define a process for rolling up all the  
updates/corrections/revisions to RFC 3261 we might process in a given  
year into a single document. This process is documented in draft- 
drage-sip-essential-correction-02. We hope to apply this same process  
to other RFCs in the core set.

We've recently been having some discussion on what, if any, drafts  
should be steered into this process vs. conventional standards and  
BCP tracks.

Let's revisit the rationale for the "essential corrections" process:  
the idea is to reduce the number of documents that an implementer  
will have to read in order to produce a correct implementation of our  
RFCs. Problems and their corrections belong not in a bug-tracking  
system, but need to be resolved in IETF-published documents.

I believe that Jonathan sees draft-ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide-04 as  
the place where all of the core RFCs, their extensions, and  
corrections thereto are put into a usable order and given the  
perspective needed to make them work. That's certainly one way to  
track the relationships between various documents, and I think we  
need it. But I think we need something else.

There are two primal approaches to updating RFCs. In one, every  
change is an optional extension to the RFC that might or might not be  
used. Negotiation mechanisms like option tags are required for every  
extension, as is fallback behavior to operation without that  
extension. The nature of the core protocol remains unchanged --  
perhaps certain modalities are never exercised, but they remain in  
the specifications as paths that need to be tested for when  
considering compliance against the specifications.

The second approach is to issue revisions that actually change the  
specification, potentially eliminating or replacing entire blocks of  
functionality that need no longer be tested, and potentially  
inserting new behavior that becomes "the standard" against which  
implementations are judged. The most obvious way to make these sort  
of changes to an RFC is to issue a new RFC that replaces (and makes  
obsolete) an older one. IETF also allows new RFCs to "revise" older  
ones, essentially including them by reference into a new  
specification. The problem with this approach is that it might be  
possible for many such revisions to be made to a large spec such as  
RFC 3261, and it then becomes very difficult to effectively "merge"  
all these changes into a working specification against which one can  
implement (and test) correctly.

Out "essential corrections" process is an attempt to manage the  
complexity of many revisions by collecting those revisions into  
periodic batches and issuing each batch as an RFC that revises a core  
specification.

The question is: Which, if any, changes need to be processed as  
extensions and which as revisions?

Here's a test I'd like to propose: If the change is such that if we  
were re-writing the affected RFC we'd include the new behavior as  
normative behavior, then we track it as a revision. This allows us to  
fully deprecate the behavior that it replaces, such that we no longer  
have to consider the old behavior when compliance testing. If we  
can't deprecate the replaced behavior, then we really do have an  
extension (not a revision), and we need an extension negotiation  
mechanism to know when it can be used or is being used.

I'd actually like to see us go beyond the batching of "essential  
corrections" and start maintaining complete and fully-revised  
versions of the normative behaviors as internet drafts, perhaps  
occasionally publishing them as RFCs that replace the older versions.  
So for example with RFC 3261, we'd maintain a "draft-ietf-sip-rfc3261- 
bis" that would start as a copy of RFC 3261 (with current  
boilerplate, of course) and then be edited to reflect the changes  
documented in each "essential correction" we agree to. Then instead  
of telling implementors to go read RFC 3261 plus a dozen more  
potentially conflicting revision documents, we could just say "see  
draft-ietf-sip-rfc3261-bis-xx".

that sounds like a good idea.  would only corrections go to the bis
documents or would also clarifications be allowed?

   Connection Reuse: The process of using the same connection to send
     new requests in the backwards direction (i.e., A opens a connection
     to B to send requests, and B uses the same connection to send
     new requests to A.)

   Connection sharing: The process of using the same connection to send
     multiple requests on the same connection (and of course, receive
     multiple responses over the connection.)  A shared connection will
     not be reused for requests in the backwards direction.

   Comments?  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Other terms to document?

This is good, but I'd replace the sentence "A shared connection will
not..." with "Connection sharing does not imply connection reuse."
Once you get that straightened out, you can say "TCP connections are
shared by default, but should not be reused except when the recipient
has some way to authenticate the source."  If "shared" *excludes*
"reused", that straightforward statment requires awkward
circumlocutions.

Perfect; I'll make the change.  Thanks, Dale.

I will say something to the following effect:

   ... Connection sharing does not imply connection reuse except
   when the recipient has some assurance of the authenticity of
   the source.

Since this text that defines these terms will go in the beginning
of the draft (probably in the terminology section), I will leave
out the details of which connections can be shared by default (like
TLS) and which ones (like TCP) should only be shared under certain
circumstances.  The reader will, in time, read the relevant sections
and arrive at the requisite conclusion.

Thanks,

We are still talking the sip-essential-correction model here, right?
Or is what you propose above a new model?

Isn't that what we essentially did with rfc2543-bis set of drafts?
Of course, the domain of influence of SIP back then was a bit more
limited than it is now.

Hadriel,

I am entirely with you if the *intent* of sending the vcard is to render 
it to the user in some human readable way. Its hardly any different from 
sending HTML.

Its much more questionable if the intent is that the vcard be filed in 
the recipients address book without being rendered.

Even so, I think it is an open question whether content-dispositions 
other than "render" are valid with MESSAGE. And if so, which ones?

	Paul

Not that I want to contradict myself on it being a valid use-case for INFO, but personally I'm not so sure that vcard/vcalendar is wrong for MESSAGE.  I mean we can argue if sending that type of data is really justification for an "Instant Message" request, but I'm talking more about whether content that isn't directly rendered to the user can be put into MESSAGE.

I'm not sure I agree with this. I think we have some extensions which 
we'd arguably include as, 'things we'd make as new normative behavior 
that is core to sip'. I personally would have wished that nat traversal 
were an integral part of sip and if I could do it over, would not have 
it split out. But clearly ICE and outbound and all that are not 
essential corrections.

In my mind, the right litmus test is that the new behavior:

   1. cannot be negotiated using the standardized techniques, AND
   2. represents a change that impacts interoperability with other 
implementations which might not implement this new behavior

THEN its an essential correction.

THings like BNF bugs are clearly in scope. Something like record-route 
fix doesn't meet this litmus test because of the second item. I can 
implement this and fully interoperate with existing implementations.

I thought the idea is that there is just one revision document 
(essential corrections) and not seven.

I promise you that once you open the floodgates to an rfc3261 revision 
spec, the temptation to do LOTS of other things to the document will be 
too great. Clarify this while we're at it? OK. Maybe we should pull that 
extension in. ANd so on. I don't want to do that. Segmenting this into 
an essential corrections document keeps pandoras box from opening.

The amount of work that went into rfc2543 -> rfc3261 was astoundingly 
large, as any of the editors who basically did this as a full time job 
for like 6 months will tell you (my boss would ask me when I was coming 
back to work...). I do not think we as a working group have or want to 
spend the cycles on such a monumentally large task at this time.

buffer? as in, the network would hold the media and delivered to the 
called party only after 200 OK? No IETF spec makes that recommendation.

As above.

SIP says that the calling UA must be prepared to accept media after 
sending an offer. The called UA has to be prepared to receive after 
sending the answer. There is nothing about buffering.

I guess the question is if "render" is synonymous with "inline", as 3261 so=
unds like it is?  If so, then I think you're right "render" is wrong.  How =
is it done in email?  I think content-disposition "attachment" vs. inline. =
 So yeah, the question is if MESSAGE can handle non-render ones.  (clearly =
"session" would NOT be valid :)

   I am entirely with you if the *intent* of sending the vcard is to render 
   it to the user in some human readable way. Its hardly any different from 
   sending HTML.

   Its much more questionable if the intent is that the vcard be filed in 
   the recipients address book without being rendered.

IMHO, filing information is as good as actually rendering it.  The
real question is layering -- "render" means "deliver to the layer
above the SIP UA".  Anything that partakes of media is "rendered" and
is acceptable for MESSAGE, anything that partakes of signaling is not
"rendered" and is acceptable for INFO.

One criterion is "Would it make sense to let the user arbitrarily
re-route where this information goes?"  With a vcard, it makes sense.
With the information INFO was intended to carry, it does not:

   RFC 2976 1.1 Example Uses

      The following are a few of the potential uses of the INFO message:

      - Carrying mid-call PSTN signaling messages between PSTN
        gateways.

      - Carrying DTMF digits generated during a SIP session.

      - Carrying wireless signal strength information in support of
        wireless mobility applications.

      - Carrying account balance information.

More importantly MESSAGE allows out-of-dialog requests.  :)
I was thinking the same as you, but I believe Paul's right in that render=
=3Dinline and vcard/vcalendar are not inline.  The question is if we want t=
o let "attachment" disposition be allowed.  I dread to do that, because peo=
ple are already using MESSAGE to transfer 10MB images, but that's a separat=
e ugly problem. :(

I'm not very well informed of MIME, but I question whether "render" is 
synononymous with "inline". Rather I suspect "render" was chosen because 
"inline" didn't make sense for SIP.

My impression is that with mail "inline" is used for "extra" body parts 
to indicate that they should be rendered "inline" with the rendering of 
the overall message, which makes sense since for mail the expectation is 
that the overall message *is* being rendered. So the headers of the 
message are rendered (usually not literally, but rather in a pretty 
way), and the body parts marked inline are rendered inline with that.

In the case of sip, the overall message is *not* being rendered, at 
least not in the case of INVITE. (At the time this was being defined 
MESSAGE wasn't in the picture.)

If "render" were used with a body part in an invite, then I think it 
makes sense to expect that the UA goes out of its way to present it to 
the user of the device in some way - unusual because most invites don't 
have this.

If somebody had thought about it at the time, MESSAGE should probably 
have been handled just like mail, using "inline" and "attachment", etc. 
But I guess for purposes of MESSAGE we might be able to treat inline and 
render as synonymous.

> If so, then I think you're right "render" is wrong.  How is it done in email?  I think content-disposition "attachment" vs. inline.  So yeah, the question is if MESSAGE can handle non-render ones.  (clearly "session" would NOT be valid :)

Attachment could be good for a vcard in a MESSAGE. But it might be a bit 
strange without also having an inline or render part as well. (Just as 
it would be strange to get an email that only had "attachment" parts - 
there is nothing to attach them to.)

So you might have a MESSAGE that says: "Here is my vcard." and has the 
vcard as an attachment.

Does it? Lots of things could mean that. E.g. "inline" and "attachment" 
could mean that too. If the "layer above the sip ua" can get these 
things with different dispositions then we have simply passed the buck 
on what it means.

I *think* each different type of sip message needs to define the content 
dispositions that are valid with it and what they mean for it.

I don't understand the above.

I'm not certain I understand that either, or to the extent I do I don't

Balance, and maybe signal strength, could also be usefully rendered to 
the user.

I'm thinking that the body of a MESSAGE ought to allow almost all the 
same things, with the same meanings, as the body of an MSRP message.

BUT it should be strictly limited in the overall size it can be. If what 
you want to send won't fit in a MESSAGE then switch to MSRP.

So, who makes the decission whether a bug (I guess we all agree it IS a =
bug) is "important enough"?

My understanding is that this bug was found at SIPit, so it is not pure =
"theoretical".

I do agree with you that it shouldn't occur that often, because I see no =
reason why one would need to use the affected characters.=20

But, never the less, the fix MAY be important from a parser =
implementation perspective.

Just to correct the context here :

This bug was not FOUND at SIPit, in any test scenario. But, was rather =
pointed out by me as an issue in the spec.

While it is unlikely that we would face this issue in a "real" =
situation, as Christer said, it will be helpful (and unambiguous) for =
parser implementors.

The working group, by consensus.

If you cannot think of a use case when this would come up, then how can 
you claim it may be important?

You are confusing 'small' with 'non-essential'. I agree small bugs can 
be essential to fix, and the one you pointed out (which is not an 
rfc3261 bug) is small and essential.

But this BNF problem that was raised is small but NON-ESSENTIAL, and its 
because I don't believe its essential, that I don't think it merits 
addressing.

It's the "logical product" of the essential corrections process.

Each draft in the essential corrections process has to specify line- 
by-line changes to the RFC it is correcting. If we were to extract  
those changes and apply them to the source, we would get the  
"tracking draft" I'm talking about.

Not really. The 2543-bis work was more traditional draft editing. The  
various editors would get input, make changes to the draft, then we'd  
review the changes and maybe accept them or back them out or change  
them again.

In the extended essential corrections process, we'd formally review  
and reach consensus on each change before committing the change into  
the -bis document. So every -bis document would reflect WG consensus  
on the changes at any given time.

Ok, there's probably a valid argument here. It's important to note  
also that if something is an "essential correction", we'd be willing  
to say that an implementation that does not conform to the correction  
is in violation of the specification and needs to be fixed. In other  
words, there is the same sort of justification for fixing it as there  
is for "MUST" in RFC 2119 -- failure to conform creates a failure to  
interoperate or function correctly.

Now, it's arguable whether the record-route-fix falls into this  
category or not. Route rewriting, as opposed to double recording,  
prevents route signing. Is the ability to use route-signing important  
enough that we'd say that any implementation that precludes its use  
is "broken"? I'd say that this is the test.

Let's say we roll the 7 changes (I just made that number up, there  
may be more or less) for 2008 into the 2008 essential corrections  
RFC. What do we do in 2009? Copy all of the 2008 changes into the  
2009 RFC? What happens when we've had overlapping changes, such that  
the same part of the spec has been touched twice? Does the second  
change need to write step-by-step edits against the base RFC, or  
against the base RFC as amended by the first change? This gets hairy,  
and it is made a lot easier if we write the first change against the  
RFC, apply the first change to the RFC to generate the -bis spec, and  
then make subsequent corrections bundles against the -bis spec. This  
gives us a "fully assembled" spec to work against. Reverse deltas as  
opposed to forward deltas, from a source-code-control perspective.

I'll certainly agree that a substantial amount of discipline is  
required in either case.

The question is: Do we want one document an implementor can go to, or  
do we want a base document plus many "diff" deltas?

Looking at the bug tracker for RFC 3261, I can see that there have  
been 85 different bugs filed. While some may not meet the criteria of  
"essential" (is confusing "excepting" and "accepting" essential?),  
I'll bet you there are still a lot of things that need fixing in the  
doc. And RFC 3261 isn't the only spec that needs polishing -- there  
are over 200 bugs in that tracker.

I'm not proposing SIP 3.0 here -- just proposing ways to correct the  
known bugs in our RFCs that produces a result usable by developers,  
students, other SDOs, and other readers of those RFCs. What we're  
doing now IS NOT WORKING.

there should be one document that implementor needs to read, not a base
plus corrections docs.

Thanks! I know when you agree with something that it's probably  
technically right. However, it's also usually a sign that I'm going  
to have a hard time convincing the other folks in the WG about it!

Have a happy holiday season and new year.

Here's another indication.  I think it should be one document too.

Marketing for the eComm March 2008 conference (see www.eCommMedia.com) is
away to drive ahead with the messages which I give them. One of these
messages is critical towards SIP. Before the marketing material is
finalised, I'd like to first welcome responses. I'd love to copy all the
messages but I may run the risk of getting accused of spamming the list so
below I've just copied the section that relates to SIP:

"Voice Industry Stagnancy
Telcos still see themselves as masters of communications innovation and the
guardians to the creation of new services. Yet 3G, FMC, IPTV, NGN and IMS
services are failing in the market place. At the same time consumer
attention drifts increasingly towards Internet based applications such as
Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, FlickR, SecondLife, World of Warcraft Etc. which
are becoming increasingly voice enabled.

Yet within the Internet realms VoIP is still heralded as the communication
revolution. But VoIP on it's own is nothing more than digital telephony and
it will never be profitable. It has gained little consumer traction and can
be announced as dead-on-arrival. SIP the VoIP signaling protocol even after
a decade of development has had little consumer reach and the entire notion
of a common signaling protocol is now under question. "

Now it would seem stupid to ask people to call their baby ugly. BUT what I
do hope for, is that there is enough people with a balanced view who if they
feel strongly against this position and can provide clear rationale, then I
will have it modified/changed accordingly. Otherwise it will be accepted as
true. Seems fair?

Thanks Lee

SIP is a protocol, not an application. Protocols don't have any  "consumer
traction". 

Now within the voice industry if you can tell me a single large
wireline/wireless telco that hasn't done some work or planning in replacing
class 4 and later class 5 switching equipment with a SIP/IMS core, you
probably work in another industry. Same core we will use for 4G in wireless. 

>From my experience telco investment cycles  have a 5 to 10 year period. All
major telcos have started working towards the change just 2 or 3 years ago.
It will take 2 or 3 more, at least, before we start. Once we do, it will be
fun. Nobody is planning to deploy voip just because it sounds cool or
because the "industry analysts" recommend it. What's more, in the way most
telcos are planning it, it will go mostly unnoticed by customers. We sell
voice or multimedia communications, not voip.

Facebook might have a lot of consumer traction but it doesn't generate any
net income. And they don't offer you any service you pay for. Telcos can
complement facebook while the hype lasts, yes; many are working on that. BTW
anyone remembers secondlife virtual stores?  

Just my $0.02

Marketing for the eComm March 2008 conference (see www.eCommMedia.com)
is away to drive ahead with the messages which I give them. One of these
messages is critical towards SIP. Before the marketing material is
finalised, I'd like to first welcome responses. I'd love to copy all the
messages but I may run the risk of getting accused of spamming the list
so below I've just copied the section that relates to SIP:=20

"Voice Industry Stagnancy
Telcos still see themselves as masters of communications innovation and
the guardians to the creation of new services. Yet 3G, FMC, IPTV, NGN
and IMS services are failing in the market place. At the same time
consumer attention drifts increasingly towards Internet based
applications such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, FlickR, SecondLife,
World of Warcraft Etc. which are becoming increasingly voice enabled.=20

Yet within the Internet realms VoIP is still heralded as the
communication revolution. But VoIP on it's own is nothing more than
digital telephony and it will never be profitable. It has gained little
consumer traction and can be announced as dead-on-arrival. SIP the VoIP
signaling protocol even after a decade of development has had little
consumer reach and the entire notion of a common signaling protocol is
now under question. "=20

Now it would seem stupid to ask people to call their baby ugly. BUT what
I do hope for, is that there is enough people with a balanced view who
if they feel strongly against this position and can provide clear
rationale, then I will have it modified/changed accordingly. Otherwise
it will be accepted as true. Seems fair?

Ari - firstly thanks for you response.

This is just semantics. Lets rephrase which keeps the line the same - there
has been a lack of consumer traction with applications which use SIP.

I'm aware of the plans and it seems to be getting a bit long in the tooth
now; the last operator I did some consulting work for (Hutchinson 3G)
evaluated packet based video (over the air interface) and decided to go
circuit switched. At a greenfield 3G deployment (Orange) I watched in
amazement that analogue signalling links (V35 based SS7) were put in place!
My impression is that there is a large difference between any action on the
ground and Powerpoint slides.

But really this bypasses more fundamental points. The first question is
whether any investment directly relates to any significant ROI? Customer
behaviour is markedly different to the environment into which SIP was
originally envisaged; is voice not pass=E9 now? Voice as a standalone offer=
ing
is not going to be profitable long term. The profits are to be chased in th=
e
ways into which voice can be combined into business processes, social
networking Etc. (I really can't go into this here - more combinations are
listed on the eCommMedia.com about page). A dark cloud is appearing over
SIP/IMS in terms of being the technology underpinning such combinations. Fo=

As said voice is dead as a standalone product long term. It needs to be
looked at as an adjunct to ecommerce, social networking etc. Besides
it is pass=E9,
the kids are instant messaging given the chance. T-Mobile (States) where I
did some work recently told me that if they offer a data plan with no voice=
,
the teenage market virtually only takes it and runs IM. Talking of which I
don't even see SIMPLE playing in the IM field so late in the day. The kids
are Twittering, Beboing and IMing - voice is rare for them (tweenagers).

The direction of SIP is voice centric. Voice as a discrete service is dead
long term in terms of profit (and high application use).

When you say multimedia communications, operators can not name these. And
there is no way they can compete in this direction with the innovation
ecology of the Internet.

Facebook is still in the stage that Google was in, pre-AdSense and pre-IPO.

Just my $0.02


As indicated before I am not after upsetting folks. I'm interested in a
great conference; my understanding at this point is that telephones and mai=
n
stream media are being displaced. If I imagine how long role outs etc. take
and note the changes in consumer behaviour since the advent of broadband an=

project forwards, it is hard to see SIP lining up with the market. It
reminds me that in 1999 people started coming to SS7 training classes askin=
g
what is the point in learning SIP as it will replace SS7 within a few years=
.
Last year I did more SS7 training than any other year and AFAIK SS7 is stil=
l
used in 99% of networks. And if you want to do billable VoIP besides voice
being passe long term, then every company I have dealt with uses H.323 quit=
e
simply because it integrates with existing billing systems (those setup for
SS7). Strangely enough there is no money in free/low-cost VoIP and the
appeal of such an offering decreases over time as people wish to drive a
more "fused" application experience.

Henry to make such affirmative statements is rather lofty of you.

Having worked for most telecom vendors and many operators, in 30 countries,
exclusively in the realms of signalling, it is rather staggering that you
retort "confused" and leave it at that. That signalling work includes first
NGN trials and 3G deployments.

The "others" you refer to is "other" and I've just replied to that.

As said I asked for a balanced view as far as possible and simply hitting
reply, typing "confused"/"half-truth" is far from balanced.

to drive ahead with the messages which I give them. One of these messages is
critical towards SIP. Before the marketing material is finalised, I&#39;d like to

section that relates to SIP: <br>
<br>
&quot;Voice Industry Stagnancy<br>
Telcos still see themselves as masters of communications innovation and the
guardians to the creation of new services. Yet 3G, FMC, IPTV, NGN and IMS
services are failing in the market place. At the same time consumer attention
drifts increasingly towards Internet based applications such as Facebook,
MySpace, YouTube, FlickR, SecondLife, World of Warcraft Etc. which are becoming
increasingly voice enabled. <br>
<br>
Yet within the Internet realms VoIP is still heralded as the communication
revolution. But VoIP on it&#39;s own is nothing more than digital telephony and it
will never be profitable. It has gained little consumer traction and can be
announced as dead-on-arrival. SIP the VoIP signaling protocol even after a
decade of development has had little consumer reach and the entire notion of a
common signaling protocol is now under question. &quot; <br>
<br>
Now it would seem stupid to ask people to call their baby ugly. BUT what I do
hope for, is that there is enough people with a balanced view who if they feel
strongly against this position and can provide clear rationale, then I will
have it modified/changed accordingly. Otherwise it will be accepted as true.
Seems fair?<br>

Sure that is probably best to avoid list flame wars that could ensure
on this rather large list.

I quickly setup a mailman private mailing list (no public archiving)
for the purposes of continuing the discussion.

Sign up here:
http://ecommmedia.com/mailman/listinfo/sip_discussion_ecommmedia.com

Once signed up, post using:
sip_discussion@ecommmedia.com

Now dropping off this list on this issue.

Thanks

As a further consideration, MMUSIC already seems to be taking an
approach for SDP similar to Dean's proposal for SIP:

OK; I am with you now.  In that case, yes, maintaining one draft
is preferable.

This also means that -- as Jonathan said earlier -- we have to be

for the maintenance i suggest keeping the draft in subversion repository
and each time a change is agreed, a commit will be made.  this way it is
easy keep the draft up to date.  also, a change history is automatically
visible.  once in a while, editors can issue a new tag, which will
become next rfc bis.

Right, and to be clear, 'violation of the specification' basically 
refers to 3261 itself.

Clearly no. RFC3261 explicitly says you can't do it. I can't think of 
any reasonable use case for it.

That was Keith's original proposal.

Well, this may be a problem in theory only and not in practice. We don't 
have this problem AFAIK for any of the existing stuff.

I agree that it is easier for someone, starting from scratch, to pick up 
a document which is all of sip including the corrections, all built in. 
However for folks who already implemented rfc3261 and want to know what 
has changed, a separate document that clearly states the new 
functionality is easier.

I think we'll find the discipline much harder to follow if we are 
actually producing an rfc3261bis. Would we indeed reject a one-line 
clarifying correction?

OK - so that is more than just a few essential corrections, its a real 
revision.

WELL, rfc2543->rfc3261 wasn't a sip3.0 either; it was meant to be only 
fixes, clarifications and elimination of unimplemented things. But it 
was still huge.

I was asked by Dean to provide a SIP Expert Review of this draft, with 
special note to section 2.3. In general I like this draft. It begins to 
exploit the power of sip, and to unify it with other protocols. I did 
find some issues, all of which should be fairly straightforward to address.

I've broken my comments down by section. In many cases I have includes 
snips from the draft for reference and followed those with pertinent 
comments.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Section 2.1:

The ABNF of the URI seems excessively rigid in the ordering of 
parameters - first the init-parameters, then the vxml-parameters, then 
then any other uri-parameters. It also doesn't note that 
'uri-parameters' is defined in 3261.

I would suggest something like:

   dialog-parameters = *(";" dialog-parameter)

   dialog-parameter  = init-param /
                       vxml-param /
                       uri-parameter ; defined in RFC 3261

   init-param        = (dialog-param /
                        maxage-param /
                        maxstale-param /
                        method-param /
                        postbody-param)

   vxml-param        = vxml-keyword "=" vxml-value

That achieves the same effect but allows all the params in any order. 
This is almost a nit, but the rigid ordering is likely to be a source of 
interop problems.

I'm confused about postbody:

    postbody:  Used to set the application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded
       [HTML4] HTTP body for "post" requests (or is otherwise ignored).
       The postbody value is the prepared application/
       x-www-form-urlencoded content, subsequently URL-encoded (see note
       below).

...

    Note: Special characters in Request-URI parameter values need to be
    URL-encoded as required by the SIP URI syntax, for example '?' (%3f),
    '=' (%3d), and ';' (%3b).  The VoiceXML Media Server MUST therefore
    unescape Request-URI parameter values before making use of them or
    exposing them to running VoiceXML applications.  It is important that
    the VoiceXML Media Server only unescape the parameter values once
    since the desired VoiceXML URI value could itself be URL encoded, for
    example.  When a postbody is included, its entire content including
    any line breaks (represented by a CR LF pair) is encoded as a single
    parameter value following the above rules (such that the line breaks
    would be replaced by '%0D%0A', for example).

[HTML4] says:

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    This is the default content type. Forms submitted with this content
    type must be encoded as follows:

    1. Control names and values are escaped. Space characters are
       replaced by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as
       described in [RFC1738], section 2.2: Non-alphanumeric characters
       are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits
       representing the ASCII code of the character. Line breaks are
       represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., `%0D%0A').
    2. The control names/values are listed in the order they appear in
       the document. The name is separated from the value by `=' and
       name/value pairs are separated from each other by `&'.

The interaction between these two escaping rules seems potentially 
confusing. I *think* when this is all put together it means that the 
body must first be encoded according to the [HTML4] section above. At 
that point it will already be almost conformant to the 3261 syntax of a 
token, except for the use of '&'. Then it needs to be encoded again, 
which will take care of the ampersands, but which will re-encode the '%' 
characters of the first encoding.

Exactly what, if anything, I would recommend changing depends on whether 
I understood what is expected. I guess I might just recommend that you 
clarify further. (Perhaps I'm just being dense. If so please just tell 
me so.)

Section 2.2:

    The Application Server SHOULD insert its own URI in the Record-Route
    header so that it remains in the signaling path for subsequent
    signaling related to the session.  This is of particular importance
    for call transfers so that upstream Application Servers or proxy
    servers see signaling originating from the Application Server and not
    the VoiceXML Media Server itself.

I don't understand the purpose of the above. The SHOULD strength of this 
requirement suggests to me an assumption of a particular operating 
environment. In the general case, why should this be more than MAY strength?

Section 2.3:

IMO the use of a media-less session is an entirely valid sip usage. The 
only concern I might potentially have is if it were to catch some UA 
unaware, because some UAs just aren't prepared to handle this case. But 
the recommended usage here always puts the choice of doing this in the 
hands of *other* UA, not the media server. So I see no problem.

I do find it disconcerting that the initial invite and subsequent 
reinvites are handled in different ways. For the initial one you stall 
the VXML awaiting a media stream, but on subsequent ones you assume the 
absence of a stream is equivalent to having a stream that doesn't send 
anything. Why isn't the behavior consistent in these cases? If you need 
to support both behaviors, then it might be better to explicit and 
unique signaling for each. For instance, you might define that a media 
stream with a=inactive or a=sendonly (from the client's perspective - 
client putting media server "on hold") could be treated as the absence 
of input but the absence of the stream means you should wait for a 
stream to be negotiated.

Section 2.4:

I don't feel qualified to comment on the validity of the mappings of 
History-Info. It might be good to get somebody else who knows it well to 
comment on that.

       In addition, the array's toString() function returns the full SIP
       Request-URI.  For example, assuming a Request-URI of sip:dialog@
       example.com;voicexml=http://example.com;obj={"x":1,"y":true} then

I don't believe the above URI is valid. The ',' '{' and '}' aren't 
syntactically correct in a URI pvalue. You would need to escape them.

Section 2.6.2:

IIUC, message (1) contains no offer, (5) contains an offer with media, 
and (6) accepts the call but rejects the media. If so, then (9) will 
most likely be invalid. To make it valid, the o-line from (8) needs to 
be replaced with one consistent to that used in (6), with the version 
number incremented. And if (5) has more m-lines than (8), then (9) needs 
to be padded with extra (rejected) m-lines.

Section 5.2:

    On receipt of the REFER request, the VoiceXML Media Server MUST issue
    a provisional response, 100 Trying.  The 202 Accepted response
    indicates that the VoiceXML document has been fetched and parsed
    correctly.  The VoiceXML Media Server proceeds to place the outbound
    INVITE and will execute the application after the ACK is sent.

The rules of RFC 4320 need to be followed here. REFER is a non-invite 
transaction and so the timing of the 100 must be as specified in 4320.

In the call flow, the sending of the initial NOTIFY before the 202 for 
the REFER, and especially before determining if REFER is going to 
succeed or fail, is at best unusual and almost certainly incorrect. 
Sending the NOTIFY and then sending a failure response would certainly 
be incorrect.

I think you have two choices:

- wait until the get is complete before sending the NOTIFY, and probably 
send it after the 202.

- send a 202 for the REFER before doing the GET. Inform of a GET failure 
via a NOTIFY.

Section 6.3:

In the call flow I think you probably need another NOTIFY between 
messages (6) and (7). Its potentially too long until (13).

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for users to make
anonymous calls.  However, users receiving such calls have the right
to reject them because they are anonymous.  SIP has no way to
indicate to the caller that the reason for call rejection was that
the call was anonymous.  Such an indication is useful to allow the
call to be retried without anonymity.  This specification defines a
new SIP response code for this purpose.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

STANDARDS TRACK: This document specifies an Internet standards track
protocol for the Internet community,and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.Please refer to the current edition of the Internet
 Official Protocol Standards (STD 1) for the standardization state and
 status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : G. Camarillo, et al.
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-03.txt
	Pages           : 15
	Date            : 2007-12-18

This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this
method can be used to refer to multiple resources in a single
request.  These extensions include the use of pointers to Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI)-lists in the Refer-To header field and the
"multiple-refer" SIP option-tag.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-03.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-multiple-refer-03.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I have just submitted a new version of the multiple REFER draft, as you 
can see in the announcement e-mail below. There is only one change, but 
it had impact in many places in the whole document. The change came from 
the Gen-ART reviewer Francis Dupont, who commented that the draft was 
hard to follow because of mixing terminology. In fact, the draft was 
using UAC, UAS, UA, REFER-Issuer, REFER-Recipient, REFER-Target, 
URI-List service, conference server, and server, in a mixed way. So, the 
effort in this revision has been to homogenize the terminology and use 
REFER-Issuer/Recipient/Target whenever possible.

You can track the changes of the document in the following URL:

Hi All,
=20
There is a weird situation with us:
(1) A Linksys phone sends an INVITE out with incorrect destination TN.
As a result, our application server will set up a call between the
Linksys phone and an IVR
(2) A user incorrectly hits the on-hold key, which is basically sending
a re-INVITE to the IVR
(3) Our server seems to have answered the re-INVITE with a BYE
(4) The Linksys phone responds to the BYE with a 200
(5) Afterwards, the Linksys phone still thinks that its original
re-INVITE has not been responded.  So, it will keep resend re-INVITE
=20
The consequence of these re-INVITEs is a registration migration, which
we don't like.  We have been trying to figure out which side is not
following RFC 3261, the phone, the SBCs are wrong, or the application
servers.
=20
I am wondering:
(A) Is it legal for a server to ignore the re-INVITE and respond with a
BYE and has nothing in between?
=20
(B) If a UA has responded to a BYE with 200, is it supposed to forget
about the re-INVITE request that it has sent out and not try to resend
the re-INVITE, assuming a dialog has already been terminated with the
BYE/200 transaction?  Maybe in another sentence, is it legal to send our
re-INVITEs outside an dialog, even if these re-INVITEs are the repeats
of an original in-dialog re-INVITE?
=20
Thanks!

Jane

Jane,

Can you provide a call flow for what is happening? Its a little hard to 
follow from the textual description.

But in the meantime there is one fundamental principle of importance 
here: every transaction completes independently.

While the BYE may in some way have been provoked by the reINVITE, the 
two are distinct. The reINVITE still needs to be answered with some 
final response which then must be ACKed, and the BYE also needs to be 
responded to.

It is not legal to send a *new* reINVITE after the dialog has been 
terminated. But it is appropriate to continue retransmissions if no 
response has been received.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : An Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) Diff Event Package
	Author(s)       : J. Urpalainen
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-00.txt

This document describes an "xcap-diff" SIP event package, with the
aid of which clients can receive notifications of the partial changes

This is really off-target for this list, and possibly more appropriate
for the sip-implementors list. It just occurred to me that we may also
need something more like a sip-users list for people who are trying to
make off-the-shelf stuff work. Perhaps there is such a list somewhere.

My rather old-fashioned point of view suggests that every device in your
chain is misbehaving.

It seems a bit odd to me that the Linksys phone does a reinvite-to-hold
before it completes the first INVITE transaction, but I'm perhaps
misreading your report. Were there 200 (OK) and ACK messages completing
the transaction of the initial INVITE? Or is the INVITE that the Linksys
resends the reinvite-to-hold? What do the CSeq and SDP of the
retransmitted INVITE look like?

A) It is not reasonable to respond to an INVITE with a BYE. There needs
to be a response message (like 200 or 404 or some other kind of
response) as a result of the INVITE.

B) No, every INVITE transaction needs to be completed by a final response.

B part 2) A re-INVITE sent "outside a dialog" is a new
dialog-establishing INVITE. It should have a new Call-ID. But there are
possibly some odd conditions where not every node in the dialog realizes
a dialog has ended. The dialog-uses doc would be a good thing to look at
here.

Hi guys,

because of some problems with my SIP-Client, I have traced the traffic of=
 a=20
snom SIP-phone. Now I'm a little confused about the Record-Route header.

I've made two incoming testcalls with different providers.

At the first test the snom-phone received an invite-message with record-r=
oute=20
with ftag-field. When the phone hangup it sends it's BYE-Request to the=20
IP-address defined in the last route-header-field.

At the second test (2nd provider) the snom-phone received an invite-messa=
ge=20
with record-route and NO ftag-field. When the phone hangup it sends it's=20
BYE-Request to the IP-address of the registrar.

Is it correct, that a SIP-application which receives a record-route with =
ftag=20
must send the traffic depending on this call to that destination?

Regards=20

Marc :-)

I agree with Paul, and add to this that the CSeq value indicates 
which request a 200 OK response is for.  Having the call flow would 
be better to diagnose this, and we might ask that you include some 
SIP headers of each message in the flow (Status line, To, From, CSeq, 
Route, ...) to help further.

Hi Paul,

just to add another example to this discussion (same as the vcard example):
an application/im-iscomposing+xml content-type can be put in the body of 
a SIP MESSAGE and it is not (or it is not supposed to be) rendered
as is to the recipient; an application that understood it would render 
it in whatever way it indicates that a user is in the process of 
composing a message.

This would've been appropriate on sip-implementers mailer.

The behavior below looks correct to me and has nothing to do with ftag
field in RR header.=20

In the 1st case since UAS is getting a request with a RR header, next
request on that dialog is sent to the address in RR header and since the
proxy adding RR supports loose routing, request uri of BYE is contact
address from previous request.

In the 2nd case, since there are 2 RR headers, route set for UAS is:
<sip:213.218.28.202;lr=3Don>, <sip:213.218.28.102;lr=3Don>.=20
And the next request on that dialog is correctly sent to 213.218.28.202.

Okay, I'm now completely convinced that most uses of MESSAGE are  
really candidates for the new INFO events.

I think application/im-iscomposing+xml IS rendered; and its rendering 
causes the UI to show that the user is typing.

As a litmus test for this stuff, a question is whether it can reasonably 
be converted to a text/plain content and sent in a MESSAGE, and if it is 
rendered, is the resulting behavior reasonable. For the iscomposing 
indicators, I think you could. You could instead send a text IM like 
"Joe is typing a reply..." and render that, and this would achieve the 
same objective.

Also, I would not want to send iscomposing over the SIP dialog - I think 
it should be on the media path. There will be a LOT of them, and there 
is a requirement for timeliness. See my other note on the criteria for 
sending something in dialog vs. along the media path.

RFC 4826 specifies the XML format for representing the buddy list. XCAP

I agree with Jonathan re the rendering.

Regarding suitability of using MESSAGE in a sip dialog for this, I think 
its suitability for this is no better or worse than for sending the 
actual text itself. I suppose the is-typing functionality increases the 
number of messages used by roughly a factor of two. If you thought 
MESSAGE was suitable without this, then you might still think it is 
suitable with it.

Its probably not a good example. The point is that rendering doesn't 
necessarily mean literal rendering of communicated text. E.g. you could 
send some MIDI encoding and have it rendered audibly.

I think INVITE is rendered, and its rendering causes the uses phone  
to make a ringing nose that causes the user to press a button that  
causes a new message to be sent.

If you displayed the current iscomposing object on  the screen, I'm  
afraid you'd just confuse my mom. It's not just text.

Before you send it, you really need to know that the other end  
understands what you mean. That's the crux of what is wrong with INFO  
today.

Well, that's reasonable, but we have what we have, and that's a SIP  
message for iscomposing, and probably some IPR on that too.

Do you think its ok for the message to contain html?

If you rendered html text directly it would also confuse your mom.

Whatever is sent is just an *encoding* that must be translated into a 
meaningful rendering for the recipient.

That's actually debatable.

HTML at least has relatively standard "rendering"  -- XML, especially  
in the absence of some kind of style sheet, doesn't.

True. It would be nice to make sue her UA supports HTML before  
sending it to her, wouldn't it?

But at least here (this use of MESSAGE) we have an existing way to  
say "I don't support that MIME type in a render-to-user context",  
which may be adequate. That does put is in a better position than we  
were with INFO.

        I have some questions about the frame work proposed in the draft which defines a framework for SIP policy. See bellow:          1. What the advantage is in the proposed framework in which UA require its policy (which means it contacts policy server after contacts proxy) by itself? An alternative is, the proxy contacts the proxy server on behalf of the UA, and return or not return determined policies, which means UA need not involved in the procedure of contacting policy server. So why the one proposed in the draft is better?
   
      2. If it retrieves policies according to call flow this draft, how a proxy knows that the policies in the resending request for the UA is genuine, especially for the specific ongoing request?(which means there should be security mechanism to avoid replay attacks).Can anyone give me some ideas or solutions?
   
  Thanks.

Not that I like responding to my incoherent posts, but this one totally 
failed to make sense. I've got to stop posting after midnight and before 
noon.

That's "make sure her UA supports HTML before sending it" . . .

That should have read  "does put us in a batter position than we were 
with INFO".

Hi,

I have an editorial (?) question on the MIME message body example in
chapter 23.4.3 of 3261.


INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.com SIP/2.0
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com;branch=3Dz9hG4bKnashds8

Etc etc etc


Now, as far as I know (please correct me if I am wrong) Content-Length
is NOT a MIME header. If so, I guess it shouldn't be used as a MIME
header (together with Content-Type, Content-Transfer-Encoding etc)?

Regards,

Christer

Right, it isn't.  It could be argued that SIP's Content-Length was taken from
HTTP (RFC1945) rather than MIME.  It could be argued HTTP took the idea from
email -- Content-Length used to be common in email headers a decade or two ago
(but Content-Length didn't work too well for email for a variety of reasons).
RFC2076 (February 1997) lists it, and says it was not a standard email header
at the time.

RFC2045 does say:

   Any sort of field may be present in the header of an entity,
   but only those fields whose names begin with "content-" actually have
   any MIME-related meaning.

but of course Content-Length doesn't have any meaning to MIME (neither would
Content-Crayon).  But neither of those headers do harm to a MIME parser,
because a MIME parser ignores fields it doesn't understand.


I guess you're saying SIP should have used something like "Length:" instead of
"Content-Length:" to avoid collision with MIME's self-claimed ownership of all
field names that begin with "Content-"?

No no.

I am not talking about the usage of Content-Lenght (or any other
Content- header) in the SIP part of the message. I was referring to the
usage of Content-Length in the MIME part of the message body.

Perhaps the salient difference isn't whether the contents are directly  
rendered (or indirectly rendered), but whether there are additional  
side-effects that alter an application-level state machine.

This is an aspect of the ongoing attempt to nail down what the content 
dispositions mean, and whether they mean the same thing for all methods. 
Its especially pertinent for "render" because that is the default 
disposition code for sip body parts, and because its far from clear that 
"render" could mean the same thing for all methods.

Ah - thanks for clarifying.  So you are referring to the second Content-Length
field in the example at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#page-212 -- the
Content-Length field with the value 231.  I agree it shouldn't be in that
example.  Looks like something to add to the Essential Corrections.

Hi All,

when an INVITE client transaction is in the Calling state, on receipt of
Success (200 OK) response. As per RFC 17.1.1.2(Figure 5: INVITE client
transaction), the 2xx response MUST cause the client transaction to enter
the "Terminated" state. But, I'm not sure what would be To_Tag in generating
ACK for that 200 OK.

Any response is highly appericated.

Thanks,
Sudhir

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)       : M. Garcia-Martin, G. Camarillo
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt
	Pages           : 19
	Date            : 2007-12-21

This document specifies a mechanism that allows a SIP User Agent
Client (UAC) to send a SIP MESSAGE request to a set of destinations,
by using a SIP URI-list (Uniform Resource Identifier list) service.
The UAC sends a SIP MESSAGE request that includes the payload along
with the URI list to the MESSAGE URI-list service, which sends a
MESSAGE request including the payload to each of the URIs included in
the list.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

OK. But what should be the body of the 200 OK PRACK (Pattern 5)  before =
sending 488 to INVITE for termination of the dialog.

A new version of I-D, draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message-03.txt has been 
successfuly submitted by Miguel Garcia-Martin and posted to the IETF 
repository.

Filename:	 draft-ietf-sip-uri-list-message
Revision:	 03
Title:		 Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests in the Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP)
Creation_date:	 2007-12-21
WG ID:		 sip
Number_of_pages: 19

Abstract:
This document specifies a mechanism that allows a SIP User Agent
Client (UAC) to send a SIP MESSAGE request to a set of destinations,
by using a SIP URI-list (Uniform Resource Identifier list) service.
The UAC sends a SIP MESSAGE request that includes the payload along
with the URI list to the MESSAGE URI-list service, which sends a
MESSAGE request including the payload to each of the URIs included in
the list.
 



The IETF Secretariat.

The 200 Ok can have the port number in m line set to 0 to indicate that
the media stream is not acceptable.

	OK. But what should be the body of the 200 OK PRACK (Pattern 5)
before sending 488 to INVITE for termination of the dialog.

		Hi,
		=20
		I have a call scenario, where UAC had sent an offer (not
initial) in PRACK and the UAS needs to refuse the offer. Can the UAS
refuse the offer using a 4xx response (e.g. 488) ? I don't find any
specific example in the currently available RFCs and/or drafts.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.


	Title           : An Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) Diff Event Package
	Author(s)       : J. Urpalainen
	Filename        : draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-00.txt
	Pages           : 14
	Date            : 2007-12-18

This document describes an "xcap-diff" SIP event package, with the
aid of which clients can receive notifications of the partial changes
of Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
(XCAP) resources.  The initial synchronization and document updates
are based on using the XCAP-Diff format.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-00.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of 
the message.
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce
to change your subscription settings.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the 
username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After 
logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-xcapevent-00.txt".

NOTE:   The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

.... that the SIP Forum has a "discussion" mailing list which is for  
general discussion of items related to SIP and recently has had some  
of this type of traffic on the list:

http://sipforum.org/mailman/listinfo/discussion

Good to know about the "sip-implementors" list, too.  I was not aware  
of that one.

Dan

Hi,

When a UA gets record-route header and contact header
in 200 OK. like below
------------------------------------------------
contact:sip:{fqdn}:5060
Record-Route:<sip:{ip};lr=on;ftag=100428709;vsf=AAAAAAAEFwQNBB8EChgLATU1Mzc3NkA2My4yNTEuMjIuODI->

What should be the uri in the re-invite message to put
UAS on hold.. And if we use the record-route header as
uri, should/may we put the contact header in 200 OK as
route header?

And the issue I am having for the end of above
scenario; should uri of ACK message be contact header
coming from UAS in 200 OK regardless of whatever
record-route or contact header  we previously got in
initial call setup.?

I will really appreciate if anyone can suggest any
reference-document which is including sample flows
about processing record-route headers on UAC side.

Thanks..

Since the proxy supports loose routing, for subsequent requests on the
dialog, the request-uri should be the Contact header uri and
Record-Route header value should be put in Route header.

Dear All,

I have a quarry related to OPTION.

I have seen that one of the proxies is sending OPTION to its client at some
particular time interval.

Is Proxy can send OPTION to its client?

If yes, then what is purpose of doing so?

Regards,
Dharmesh Desai

The speechsc team has asked us to review draft-ietf-speechsc- 
mrcpv2-15, so I'm curious as to who here (outside of the speechsc  
chairs, of course) has been following this work. I confess, I haven't.

I'd also like to hear from folks who might be interested in reviewing  
it from a SIP perspective.

I think you are in good shape. I noted a couple of little things below.

You don't want ";" in the def of init-param because it is in the def of 
dialog-parameters.

Well, as long as you have thought about it, it is your call.
