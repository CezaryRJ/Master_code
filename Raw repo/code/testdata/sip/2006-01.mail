Neither Burst nor Dribble are mandatory according to:
http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0166.html#protocol-negotiate-modes
which says only:

  "An implementation SHOULD support both modes: dribble and burst."

Failing to declare a mandatory-to-implement mode will cause 
interoperability problems with Jingle clients, not to mention with
SIP.

To interoperate with IETF's ICE, Jingle clients need to support 
Burst.  I suggest that jep-0166 make Burst mode mandatory to 
implement.

Ignoring interop for a paragraph or two ....

A question I have about Jingle's dribble mechanism is how a client
would know that it should get some TURN-derived addresses and
Dribble them?  That is, does it first send two candidate addresses
(local address, STUN address), wait <some number of> seconds, and
then get a TURN-derived address and Dribble that address?  

I'm curious if that's the technique, and how the value of <some 
number of> is obtained.  Perhaps that could be useful for ICE to 
consider for SIP.  

As to sending UPDATE to interoperate between a Dribble client and
a SIP client, that is interesting but I don't believe anyone has
considered what it would do to an already-running ICE state
machine, especially as the newly-added TURN address would be
on the m= line (because TURN is most likely to work it gets stuck
on the m= line) and not on an additional candidate on the
a=candidate line -- at least, per ICE's intention today.  Of
course, today, nobody has specified how UPDATE would work
in conjunction with ICE.

That's fair.

I am confidant that we can interop SIP and Jingle signaling.

It is endpoint interop that is most important; without that, 
we'll be forced to use media relays to interoperate between 
SIP and Jingle.  Media relays, bad.

Jerome,

No I didn't consider this was necessary.=20

In fact the need for a parameter at all in the P-Answer-State header is
really only for completeness and to ensure that you can positively
indicate a confirmed response since a value of "Confirmed" in the
P-Answer-State header in a 200 OK has the same semantics of a 200 OK
without the P-Answer-State header.

Andrew, Cullen,

Brief question: Did you consider to allow generic parameters in the
P-header=20
(even though none are defined right now?)
I remember someone saying that this was commonly done for new SIP
headers,=20
it wouldn't be the first time that in hindsight we'd like to add a=20
parameter...

I side with Jerome on this. It is just good insurance for the future. 
Not providing for this can prove unfortunate in the future.

For example, the P-Asserted-Identity header is defined to not take 
parameters at all. It has recently started to look like parameters on 
that header would be an excellent way to assert roles for the identity. 
But that option is not available because the existing definition is not 
extensible for parameters.

yes - it's just a way to provide the configuration information

This was originally suggested but many people were against sending a message
that would be invalid and wanted to require configuration indicating STUN
was allowed before sending a stun message.

I think people thought the SIP OPTIONS was always a worse idea than the CRLF
keep alive but I follow your idea.

The IESG has approved the following document:

- 'Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) '
   <draft-ietf-sip-identity-06.txt> as a Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Allison Mankin and Jon Peterson.

A URL of this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-identity-06.txt

Technical Summary
 
   The existing security mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol
   are inadequate for cryptographically assuring the identity of the end
   users that originate SIP requests, especially in an interdomain
   context.  This document specifies a mechanism for securely identifying
   originators of SIP messages.  It does so by defining two new SIP
   header fields, Identity, for conveying a signature used for
   validating the identity, and Identity-Info, for conveying a reference
   to the certificate of the signer.  It specifies the mechanisms and
   procedures for using these and how they can be used with the
   existing SIP privacy capabilities.

   It is desirable for SIP user agents to be able to send requests to
   destinations with which they have no previous association - just as
   in the telephone network today, one can receive a call from someone
   with whom one has no previous association, and still have a
   reasonable assurance that their displayed Caller-ID is accurate.  A
   cryptographic approach, like the one described in this document, can
   probably provide a much stronger and less-spoofable assurance of
   identity than the telephone network provides today.


Working Group Summary
 
 This specification required a number of tries and much analysis.  
 There was strong consensus on the solution by the time it reached
 the version in this draft.
 
Protocol Quality
 
 Eric Rescorla provided early architectural review of the work.
 The careful reading by the GEN-ART reviewer, Lakshminath
 Dondeti was valuable.  Allison Mankin is the Responsible Area Director.

Hi
Actually if we look at the intent of ACK in case of 2xx response things 
become similar.
the ACK for 2xx resonse may carry SDP and it will un-necessarily congest the 
network if it is sent thru all the proxies which are handling the messaging 
statefully. Ack is usually exchanged directly
purpose of ACK is also to tell the end UAS that the originator has received 
200 message (which has SDP) so that conversation can begin. so this signfies 
the need of ACK.

in case of non-2xx final response, intent of ACK just to ackknowledge the 
previous node that i have received the non-2xx response. and if ACK is not 
received retransmit the non-2xx final response.  if ACK is not sent then 
there is no way to tell the pevious node that final response is received.

This is not needed in case of 2xx response becos, if 2xx is lost in between, 
UAC will not send ACK to the UAS and UAS will re-transmit 2xx response 
again.
ACK for 2xx is exchanged directly (normally) between UAC and UAS so it does 
not congest the network.
now if for non-2xx we leave the responsiblity of delivery to UAC (the way it 
makes sure for 2xx), then even if non-2xx is lost at some intermediate node, 
UAS will send non-2xx again and will traverse thru all the nodes which is 
not neded. so by using hop-by-hop reliablity mechanism, some network traffic 
is saved.

UAS must know if 2xx is received at UAC or not because its acknolwedegement 
of SDP exchanged , else processing at UAS stops (convesation would not 
beging)
for non-2xx response UAS does not care. it does not stop any processing for 
UAS

so in essence:
for non-2xx final response (for invite) reliability is ensured hop-by-hope 
and
for 2xx final response (for invite) reliablity is ensured end to end.

If there is anything the history of the Internet has taught us it is
"Allow for upward-compatible extensions."

This is especially sensible in a case like this, where all we need to do
is provide a minimal extension to a parser to permit (and ignore)
parameters.

Is there a standardized method for mapping SIP diversion into a PRI
redirecting number information element? RFC 3398 and ITU 1912 do not seem to
address the issue completely.

The current proposed manner of dealing with this within SIP is a combination of RFC 4244 and use of the URI parameters within http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jennings-sip-voicemail-uri-04.txt

Thanks for the response ,
But i am  bit  confused now !
AFIK any final resopnse should terminate the session, then how came after 
non-2xx
response the ACK still can be part of the same transcation !!

I have the following scenario (using a "customized" SIPCOMMUNICATOR and=20
JAINSIPPRESENCEPROXY, from JAIN):

* a SIP server in a public IP address
* two SIP clients in a local network (accessing internet through a=20
gateway - called 'A' from now on)

The requests from clients to server find their way through the server=20
(naturally).
The requests from the server to the clients do not find their way to the=20
clients.(naturally, unfortunatelly ;) )

So I am testing STUN in my clients. I get the public IP address from the=20
client, which allows me to write in the contact and via headersof my=20
requests, the  public IP address that gives my client access to internet.
In that way, the server will send subsequent request to the client, to=20
that public address (to the gateway A).
My question is: How does that request (from server to client) find its=20
way "FROM the gateway A, TO the client in the local network"? Does STUN=20
give any help in this process?

Thanks

depends on your NAT and it's configuration but
basically two things to attention ;
1-private address&port binding against public ip &
port
2-keeping the binding alive by periodically.
in case your NAT is symetrical and/or  both clients
are in same private domain you will face STUN is not
enough for you , check-out ICE which Mr.Rosenberg
freezed lately :-)

Hi there!

My clients have private addresses, and the server, a public address.=20
(besides, no dynamic IP)

In my scenario, both clients are either in the same private LAN=20
sometimes, or one in a private LAN and another having a public address.
I am not sure about the NAT type that I have (clients in the LAN access=20
the public IP through 2 routers, a SMC router, and a coyote linux=20
Software router).

I 'll simply give STUN a try and analyze what happens.

Thanks.

In Paragraph 9 for " UAS Behavior" there is a line stating:
 
If the incoming request contains a Supported header field with a
   value 'timer' but does not contain a Session-Expires header, it means
   that the UAS is indicating support for timers but is not requesting
   one.  The UAS may request a session timer in the 2XX response by
   including a Session-Expires header field.  The value MUST NOT be set
   to a duration lower than the value in the Min-SE header field in the
   request, if it is present.

Its the incoming request to the UAS and this is discussing about the UAS
behaviour to handle that request then shouldnt that be a UAC in the above
paragraph instead of a UAS? So if the incoming request has supported header
with timer with no session-expires header, the "UAC" is saying it supports
timers but not requesting one.
 
Please correct me if I am missing something.

If the incoming request contains a Supported header field with a
   value 'timer' but does not contain a Session-Expires header, it means
   that the UAS is indicating support for timers but is not requesting
   one.  The UAS may request a session timer in the 2XX response by
   including a Session-Expires header field.  The value MUST NOT be set
   to a duration lower than the value in the Min-SE header field in the
   request, if it is present.

Its the incoming request to the UAS and this is discussing about the UAS
behaviour to handle that request then shouldnt that be a UAC in the above
paragraph instead of a UAS? So if the incoming request has supported header
with timer with no session-expires header, the "UAC" is saying it supports
timers but not requesting one.
 
Please correct me if I am missing something.

In Paragraph 9 for " UAS Behavior" there is a line stating:
 
If the incoming request contains a Supported header field with a
   value 'timer' but does not contain a Session-Expires header, it means
   that the UAS is indicating support for timers but is not requesting
   one.  The UAS may request a session timer in the 2XX response by
   including a Session-Expires header field.  The value MUST NOT be set
   to a duration lower than the value in the Min-SE header field in the
   request, if it is present.

Its the incoming request to the UAS and this is discussing about the UAS
behaviour to handle that request then shouldnt that be a UAC in the above
paragraph instead of a UAS? So if the incoming request has supported header
with timer with no session-expires header, the "UAC" is saying it supports
timers but not requesting one.
 
Please correct me if I am missing something.

[ABN] looks like a typo error in RFC....you are right UAC is indicating
it supports session timer but not requesting for this session....

Hi everybody,

   If this mail shouldn't be here then i am quite sorry for it, but i am
really confused how the real implementation is.

  I have tested 7 network NAT types, 4 of them are symmetric NATs, 2 of the=
m
block UDP and some TCP traffic,
1 of them (this one is ADSL, not a corparation) is full cone, and none of
them support hairpin.
  draft-ietf-sipping-nat-scenarios-03.txt is said to be the best current
practice, but it only handles symmetric NATs,
and using relay server is really inefficient, how do you deal with the bloc=
k
type NAT ?
  And there are draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-04.txt and
draft-ietf-sip-outbound-01.txt serving for the purpose of connection
reuse, but i don't see much difference, what's their real using scenario?
And is there any proxy which supports these extensions?
  Hi guys, what's the real implementation, i can't get this information by
simply searching the internet, i need your help.

Any of your help will be greatly appreciated !!!
Thx !!!

sincerely,
zbf

hai vikram ,

 ACK is considered as part of Transaction for non-2xx final responses. because Trasacation will not be considered as closed until the recepion of ACK , ensures the reliable delivery of non-2XX final responses to client.

thanks

Hi,

Just want to know if "WWW-Authenticate" header is case-sensitive while 
parsing the SIP message,
because one of the tool that I am using is rejecting "Www-Authenticate"

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Suppression of Session Initiation Protocol REFER Method Implicit Subscription
	Author(s)	: O. Levin
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-04.txt
	Pages		: 10
	Date		: 2006-1-17
	
This specification defines a way to suppress an implicit subscription
   with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER method.  A new SIP
   option tag "norefersub" is defined to indicate support for this
   extension.  A new SIP header field "Refer-Sub" is defined to request
   the usage of this extension.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-04.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.  
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.


Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-04.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-04.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Rejecting Anonymous Requests in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-acr-code-00.txt
	Pages		: 7
	Date		: 2006-1-17
	
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for users to make
   anonymous calls.  However, users receiving such calls have the right
   to reject them because they are anonymous.  SIP has no way to
   indicate to the caller that the reason for call rejection was that
   the call was anonymous.  Such an indication is useful to allow the
   call to be retried without anonymity.  This specification defines a
   new SIP response code for this purpose.

Hi,
  =20
  The spec seems doesnt seem to be very clear on this.=20
  An ACK to first Invite is a new transaction as the Invite transaction c=
ompleted as soon as UAS sends final response as 200OK. UAC is now free to=
 send a new re-invite along with the ACK to the first Invite. Now since t=
he packet ordering is not _ensured_, a reinvite can always come to UAS be=
fore ACK and hence UAS should be able to accept it.
  =20
  BTW, this might also be an implementation option, where you chose to Ig=
nore the re-invite in case the first INVITE did not have an offer and 200=
 OK was the one with the offer and ACK will contain the media-answer.=20
  =20
  My two cents.

If the ACK is expected to contain an SDP, a 500 response with Retry-After
must be returned.  Otherwise I think that it is implementer specific to
accept it or return the 500 response.

I don't believe so.  I believe the stated behavior of the UAC is that it=20
cannot send a new INVITE within a dialog until the ACK is sent.  The UAC is=

free to send any new INVITE outside of an existing dialog though. Section=20
14.1 covers this I believe.

Section 14.2 faintly implies a 491 is appropriate for the reINVITE in this=

situation (prior to receiving the ACK to the original INVITE/200 OK=
 exchange)

  Actually I think 14.1 supports more what I mentioned above:
  =20
  Quote:
  "   Note that a UAC MUST NOT initiate a new INVITE transaction within a
   dialog while another INVITE transaction is in progress in either
   direction.

      1. If there is an ongoing INVITE client transaction, the TU MUST
         wait until the transaction reaches the completed or terminated
         state before initiating the new INVITE."
  UNQUOTE
  =20
  ACK is a new transaction and receiving a final response (200OK) actuall=
y completes the INVITE transaction and hence UAC is free to Initiate a ne=
w (re)Invite transaction.

        RFC 4320

        Title:      Actions Addressing Identified Issues with the
                    Session Initiation Protocol's (SIP) Non-INVITE
                    Transaction
        Author(s):  R. Sparks
        Status:     Standards Track
        Date:       January 2006
        Mailbox:    rjsparks@estacado.net
        Pages:      7
        Characters: 13853
        Updates:    3261

        I-D Tag:    draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions-03.txt

        URL:        ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4320.txt


This document describes modifications to the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) to address problems that have been identified with the
SIP non-INVITE transaction.  These modifications reduce the
probability of messages losing the race condition inherent in the
non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic.  They also
improve the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding.
These changes update behavior defined in RFC 3261.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG with the message body 
help: ways_to_get_rfcs.  For example:

        To: rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
        Subject: getting rfcs

        help: ways_to_get_rfcs

Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the
author of the RFC in question, or to RFC-Manager@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Unless
specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for
unlimited distribution.

Submissions for Requests for Comments should be sent to
RFC-EDITOR@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Please consult RFC 2223, Instructions to RFC
Authors, for further information.

I  consider that ACK to INVITE's 200 OK is a individual transaction, but it
must send rapidly after receive

200 OK, otherwise it is no significance to acknowledge the INVITE
transaction. Even ACK send before the 

re-INVITE, for the reason of network delay, UAS may receive ACK after
re-INVITE.

 

 Deal with this scenario may be an implementation or client policy.

Actually I think 14.1 supports more what I mentioned above:

 

Quote:

"   Note that a UAC MUST NOT initiate a new INVITE transaction within a
   dialog while another INVITE transaction is in progress in either
   direction.

      1. If there is an ongoing INVITE client transaction, the TU MUST
         wait until the transaction reaches the completed or terminated
         state before initiating the new INVITE."

UNQUOTE

 

ACK is a new transaction and receiving a final response (200OK) actually
completes the INVITE transaction and hence UAC is free to Initiate a new
(re)Invite transaction.

The WiMAX Summit and the International SIP conference will jointly open
their doors in one month, on February 21st, in Paris.

Everything you must know about broadband wireless access, VoIP and
convergence will be delivered by operators and key technical players.

An exhibition, close to the two conferences, welcome industrials wishing to
demonstrate their solutions.

Do Correct me if I am wrong.

1. I think unless an ACK is receved by the UAS, its
transaction will not be complete and the UAS will
continue to re-transmit the original 200 OK. 

2. As per sec.13 of RFC 3261, 
  If the server retransmits the 2xx response for 64*T1
seconds without receiving an ACK, the dialog is
confirmed, but the session SHOULD be terminated.  This
is accomplished with a BYE, as described in Section15.

In this case, it is really difficult from the UAS
perspective to predict if it will receive a "ACK"
after the "Re-Invite" although its more likely to
receive it.

Hence, the UAS may chose to send 491 response.

If you look at the following sections from the RFC:
=20
13.2.2.4
" The UAC core considers the INVITE transaction completed 64*T1 seconds
   after the reception of the first 2xx response. "

=20

13.3.1.4

" The 2xx response is passed to the transport with an
   interval that starts at T1 seconds and doubles for each
   retransmission until it reaches T2 seconds (T1 and T2 are defined in
   Section 17).  Response retransmissions cease when an ACK request for
   the response is received.  This is independent of whatever transport
   protocols are used to send the response.
=20
      Since 2xx is retransmitted end-to-end, there may be hops between
      UAS and UAC that are UDP.  To ensure reliable delivery across
      these hops, the response is retransmitted periodically even if the
      transport at the UAS is reliable.
=20
   If the server retransmits the 2xx response for 64*T1 seconds without
   receiving an ACK, the dialog is confirmed, but the session SHOULD be
   terminated.  This is accomplished with a BYE, as described in Section
   15.

"

=20

One the UAC side, the INVITE transaction is considered completed only
after 64*T1 of the first 2xx. On the UAS side, the server is expecting
ACK within 64*T1 after the 2xx is sent, otherwise the session will be
terminated. This, in essence, means that INVITE transaction will not
complete until the ACK is sent and received. As a result I don't think
the "reinvite before ack" makes practical sense.

I  consider that ACK to INVITE's 200 OK is a individual transaction, but
it must send rapidly after receive

200 OK, otherwise it is no significance to acknowledge the INVITE
transaction. Even ACK send before the=20

re-INVITE, for the reason of network delay, UAS may receive ACK after
re-INVITE.

 Deal with this scenario may be an implementation or client policy.

Actually I think 14.1 supports more what I mentioned above:

=20

Quote:

"   Note that a UAC MUST NOT initiate a new INVITE transaction within a
   dialog while another INVITE transaction is in progress in either
   direction.

      1. If there is an ongoing INVITE client transaction, the TU MUST
         wait until the transaction reaches the completed or terminated
         state before initiating the new INVITE."

UNQUOTE

=20

ACK is a new transaction and receiving a final response (200OK) actually
completes the INVITE transaction and hence UAC is free to Initiate a new
(re)Invite transaction.

&gt;The spec seems doesnt seem to be very clear on this.<br>

Guys,

I have updated the two drafts below according to the WG latest
agreements:

=20

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub
-04.txt

- as suggested on the list, corrected the text explaining the usage of
the Required header with the new tag

=20

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-feature-param-0

- included the agreed text from the last IETF meeting recommending when
the extension SHOULD be used

I believe that both drafts are ready for the last call. Please, review
them ASAP.

Note " but the session SHOULD be terminated ",there use " SHOULD" not
"MUST".
That is the protocol allow other cases to the session isn't terminated.
I think if ACK is used to acknowledge that UAC received 200 OK and not
taking SDP, the session may not be terminated if the timer fired and UAS
received re-INVITE.
Why may UAC send re-INVITE after send ACK?
Because the protocol doesn't forbid. If the protocol explicit set a rule
that UAC MUST wait 64*T1 after received the first 200 OK before send
re-INVITE, this will not be flexible. 
In many cases, UAC need rapidly to send re-INVITE to UAS for exchange new
SDP after old INVITE transaction complete.
Another cases, the value of T1 set in UAC may not equal to UAS's, therefore,
UAC don't know wait how long.
Alternatively, if UAS receive re-INVITE before ACK that means to UAC already
received 200 OK of old INVITE, and UAS must deal with the re-INVITE and not
simple to return 491 or else failure response.

It seems to me that a well behaving UAC will send an UPDATE before sending 
a reINVITE if it has not sent the ACK yet.

Can the UAS assume (or is this stated somewhere explicitly?) the UAC has 
sent the ACK if it receives a reINVITE? This seems to mean the reINVITE 
should not be processed until the ACK arrives, or the timer triggers, which 
causes the UAS to BYE the original INVITE, and reject the reINVITE.

And when Orit sways "last call", I think that means IETF last call.

The changes that she made were in response to feedback from the WGLC.

So this is close to being your last chance . . . going . . .  
going . . . .

Hi;
What is the status of draft-ietf-sip-privacy ? 
<http://www.softarmor.com/wgdb/docs/draft-ietf-sip-privacy-05.txt>
I Can not see any other draft / RFC talking about Remote-Party-ID but this
extension is widely deployed. And also is refered in 3GPP / IMS 
Docuemnts or
drafts.

Thanks

Diego, take a look at RFC3323-3325. Seems like most manufacturers follow
these standards in new implementations and Remote-Party-ID is becoming
obsolete.

1. In case an SDP ofer was not made in the original
Invite,
there is no way we can honour this Reinvite before an
ACK and the session must be terminated. On the other
side, if a offer was made  in the Invite, the reinvite
either could be accepted/rejected(as being discussed).

Thus, the UAS needs to  exhibit a different behavior
in cases where an offer was made in Invite and when it
wasn't. This apart from cancelling the re-transmission
of 200 OK on recepton of ACK and also reinvites.

2. 64*T1 is the worst case time period before which a
ACK is to reach the UAS. For every T1 and doubling
thereafter till T2, the UAS retransmits a 200 OK.
Hence, the UAC can safely transmit the next message
from ACK after 2*T1, provided a 200 Ok is not
retransmitted, without worrying about any kind of UAS
problems.

3.Another problem from UAC side would be how it would
handle a retransmitted 200 OK(assuming the ACK is
lost) after initating a Re-Invite.

Considering UAS behavior differences it would be
easier to not to handle the reinvite at the UAS.

Hi;
Yes I'm aware of those RFC, but I know some Gateway vendors that use the 
Remote-Party-ID , also for Caller ID, screening and
billing.

Thanks

Hi All, 

I am posting the same query here in sipping since I did not get any
convincing answers in sip-Implementors list......

Subject: [Sip-implementors] doubt/bug with RFC-3455

Hi All, 

I have a doubt in the rfc 3455 with respect to P-Associated-URI syntax, 

Excerpt from RFC-3455 
<<<
4.1.2 Usage of the P-Associated-URI header

   The registrar inserts the P-Associated-URI header field into the 200
   OK response to a REGISTER request.  The header field value is
   populated with a list containing zero or more URIs that are
   associated to the address-of-record.
   If the registrar supports the P-Associated-URI header extension, then
   the registrar MUST always insert the P-Associated-URI header field in
   all the 200 OK responses to a REGISTER request, regardless of whether
   the REGISTER was an initial registration, re-registration, or
   de-registration and regardless of whether there are zero or more
   associated URIs.
>>>

it says if the registrar supports P-Associated-URI, then it has to
insert the P-Asserted-URI in 200 OK response for REGISTER 
while defining the ABNF for the same its been mentioned as 

      P-Associated-URI       = "P-Associated-URI" HCOLON
                               (p-aso-uri-spec)
                               *(COMMA p-aso-uri-spec)
      p-aso-uri-spec         = name-addr *(SEMI ai-param)
      ai-param               = generic-param

This ABNF syntax says as one or more, not zero or more number of
p-aso-uri-spec, 

Now my question is? 
1) Why do we need to insert the P-Associated-URI header if there are no
entry to fill in ? 
2) How do we specify the zero or more P-Associated-URI header values ?

Nataraju A.B.

RFC does not forbid sending re-INVITE soon after sent the ACK for the
200OK. 

I guess it would be reasonable to drop that particular retransmitted
INVITE when UAS was in expectation of ACK for the initial INVITE. If so,
the ACK Might reaches the UAS and the actual intention of the re-INVITE
would be taken care by the subsequent retransmitted re-INVITE. 

Here we are assuming, if re-INVITE can reach UAS, for sure ACK might
also reach UAS, 

Assume if all the re-INVITEs were dropped because ACK was not received
for the earlier INVITE transaction, that lead to call termination (BYE &
200) that is very much inline RFC.

Thanks & Regards,

Subject: RE: [Sip] Re: Re-Invite before ACK

1. In case an SDP ofer was not made in the original
Invite,
there is no way we can honour this Reinvite before an
ACK and the session must be terminated. On the other
side, if a offer was made  in the Invite, the reinvite
either could be accepted/rejected(as being discussed).

Thus, the UAS needs to  exhibit a different behavior
in cases where an offer was made in Invite and when it
wasn't. This apart from cancelling the re-transmission
of 200 OK on recepton of ACK and also reinvites.

2. 64*T1 is the worst case time period before which a
ACK is to reach the UAS. For every T1 and doubling
thereafter till T2, the UAS retransmits a 200 OK.
Hence, the UAC can safely transmit the next message
from ACK after 2*T1, provided a 200 Ok is not
retransmitted, without worrying about any kind of UAS
problems.

3.Another problem from UAC side would be how it would
handle a retransmitted 200 OK(assuming the ACK is
lost) after initating a Re-Invite.

Considering UAS behavior differences it would be
easier to not to handle the reinvite at the UAS.

So, let us see if I understood the two cases correctly based on this
thread:

1.  Offer-Answer complete (no SDP needed in ACK) case:

UAC:  Upon receipt of 200 OK and transmission of ACK, can send re-INVITE
with new Offer.

UAS:  After sending 200 OK (with Answer), can treat receipt of re-INVITE
as an implied ACK to the 200 OK, because otherwise the UAC would have
never sent the INVITE. =20

Where UAS wants to re-INVITE, wait for ACK to 200 OK with Answer before
sending re-INVITE to confirm Answer received.

2.  Offer-Answer not complete (SDP needed in ACK) case:

UAC:  Send Answer in ACK, then wait to see if 200 OK is retransmitted,
meaning the ACK was not received.  Thus, wait 2*T1 (expected bound for
Timer G?) after receipt of previous 200 OK.  If no 200 OK, then can
assume that ACK was received, and proceed to send the re-INVITE.

UAS:  Reject any re-INVITE before ACK received with 491 Request Pending,
since Answer to Offer in 200 OK was not received.  Accept re-INVITE with
new offer only after ACK received.

Where UAS wants to re-INVITE, wait for ACK with Answer to complete Offer
in 200 OK before sending re-INVITE.

My only question is that Timer G starts with T1 not 2*T1, so is this for
margin of safety?  Also, doesn't this assume that both UAC and UAS use
same T1 value?

I cannot answer the question, but I can indicate that as far as I understand the issue, 3GPP never needs to send only zero URIs, as this is included in a successful registration only, and therefore at least one address must be registered. The associated list is the list of all registered URIs, both implicit and explicit:

Extract from 3GPP TS 24.229 subclause 5.4.1.2.2:

"...create a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request, including:

...

b)	a P-Associated-URI header containing the list of the registered public user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user identities. The first URI in the list of public user identities supplied by the HSS to the S-CSCF will indicate the default public user identity to be used by the S-CSCF. The public user identity indicated as the default public user identity must be a registered public user identity. The S-CSCF shall place the default public user identity as the first entry in the list of URIs present in the P-Associated-URI header. The default public user identity will be used by the P-CSCF in conjunction with the procedures for the P-Asserted-Identity header, as described in subclause 5.2.6.3. The S-CSCF shall not add a barred public user identity to the list of URIs in the P-Associated-URI header;"

I will add this to a number of issues I am in the process of addressing in RFC 3455.

regards

Keith

Keith,

It is a little unclear to me from reading 24.229 whether the 
P-Associated-URI header should contain the URI being registered or not. 
The text doesn't seem very explicit about that. While not definitive, I 
think the examples in Gonzalo's book do *not* include the URI being 
registered. OTOH, since the default URI must be first, if the URI being 
registered is to be the default then it would need to be in the list.

A case when an empty P-Associated-URI might be needed is if the URI 
being registered is barred and there is no unbarred URI. Of course in 
that case the UE isn't going to be able to do anything, but there needs 
to be some way for it to discover that.

I cannot answer the question, but I can indicate that as far as I
understand the issue, 3GPP never needs to send only zero URIs, as this
is included in a successful registration only, and therefore at least
one address must be registered. The associated list is the list of all
registered URIs, both implicit and explicit:

Extract from 3GPP TS 24.229 subclause 5.4.1.2.2:

"...create a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request, including:

...

b)	a P-Associated-URI header containing the list of the registered
public user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered
public user identities. The first URI in the list of public user
identities supplied by the HSS to the S-CSCF will indicate the default
public user identity to be used by the S-CSCF. The public user identity
indicated as the default public user identity must be a registered
public user identity. The S-CSCF shall place the default public user
identity as the first entry in the list of URIs present in the
P-Associated-URI header. The default public user identity will be used
by the P-CSCF in conjunction with the procedures for the
P-Asserted-Identity header, as described in subclause 5.2.6.3. The
S-CSCF shall not add a barred public user identity to the list of URIs
in the P-Associated-URI header;"

I will add this to a number of issues I am in the process of addressing
in RFC 3455.

[ABN] If the P-Associated-URI carries at least the registered publicURI,
then the definition of P-Associated-URI should be changed to carry
atleast one URI (registered publicURI) not zero or more URIs ??? 

Does this make sense...  ????

regards

Keith

Hi Nataraju.

The spirit of the document was to have a simple mechanism where the UAC 
can notice if the P-Associated-URI extension is supported by the 
registrar. The idea was that, if the extension is supported, the 
registrar includes the header in the 200 OK response. That obviously 
requires the possibility of having an empty header, if the user under 
registration, does not have an associated URI.

Unfortunately, as you discovered, the formal syntax does not reflect 
this fact, and there is a contradiction between the formal syntax and 
the normative text. In this case, I consider the normative text to be 
correct (not the syntax).

BR,

       Miguel

Subject: RE: [Sip] Re: Re-Invite before ACK

So, let us see if I understood the two cases correctly based on this
thread:

1.  Offer-Answer complete (no SDP needed in ACK) case:

UAC:  Upon receipt of 200 OK and transmission of ACK, can send re-INVITE
with new Offer.

UAS:  After sending 200 OK (with Answer), can treat receipt of re-INVITE
as an implied ACK to the 200 OK, because otherwise the UAC would have
never sent the INVITE.  

[ABN] we can't assume implicitly, reception re-INVITE does not mean
200OK was received. For UAS to process re-INVITE, ACK should be received
@ UAS. So only I mentioned we will drop the re-INVITE received @ UAS
before ACK. For instance UAS have some flags like ACK_EXPECTED, (similar
to SDP_SENT/SDP_RECEIVED which would be used to decide about delayed or
early media negotiation cases...). any way transaction match does not
happen since transaction would have terminated soon after sending the
200OK, and dialog matches where based on flags like these we can decide
to accept the re-INVITE or not ?

Where UAS wants to re-INVITE, wait for ACK to 200 OK with Answer before
sending re-INVITE to confirm Answer received.

[ABN] TRUE (this is already covered in 3261), again based on some logic
mentioned earlier (ACK_EXPECTED)

2.  Offer-Answer not complete (SDP needed in ACK) case:

UAC:  Send Answer in ACK, then wait to see if 200 OK is retransmitted,
meaning the ACK was not received.  Thus, wait 2*T1 (expected bound for
Timer G?) after receipt of previous 200 OK.  If no 200 OK, then can
assume that ACK was received, and proceed to send the re-INVITE.

UAS:  Reject any re-INVITE before ACK received with 491 Request Pending,
since Answer to Offer in 200 OK was not received.  Accept re-INVITE with
new offer only after ACK received.

[ABN] TRUE

Where UAS wants to re-INVITE, wait for ACK with Answer to complete Offer
in 200 OK before sending re-INVITE.

[ABN] TRUE

My only question is that Timer G starts with T1 not 2*T1, so is this for
margin of safety?  Also, doesn't this assume that both UAC and UAS use
same T1 value?

[ABN] Timer G applicable only for failure responses.. not for 2xx, so
not an issue...

Why not?  If the rule for UAC above were followed, a re-INVITE would
*ONLY* be sent if the 200 OK had been received.  Thus, receipt of the
re-INVITE also implies the UAC received the 200 OK.  This is straight
forward logic contingent on that UAC behavior.

This internal ACK_Expected flag would only be needed if the ACK needed
to carry an SDP Answer as in Case 2 below.

I think RFC-3261 could be more rigorous here.  The table in the back
says INVITE responses, period.  I thought it was clear that the UAS upon
sending a 200 OK will need to retransmit that 200 OK, if it doesn't get
an ACK within some timeframe.  The UAC could have sent the ACK and won't
retranmit it unless it gets another 200 OK.  So, there is definitely a
timer for 200 OK retranmits.  I am contending it is Timer G.  If you say
it is not, then please identify the name of the Timer.

Hmm. I buy the text as describing things that are not expressable in 
ABNF. But its a bit much to expect someone to process messages that 
conflict with the ABNF based on the text.

Can Registrar accepts a REGISTER request (send 200 OK) and set the
expiration interval
to a value greater than one requested in the REGISTER?
The text in RFC 3261 (Section 10.3) (snippet below) is not explicit on on
this question.
It indicates that Registrar MAY reject a REGISTER request with 423 response
code
(if the conditions mentioned are met). Does it mean that it is also allowed
to accept
the REGISTER and set the expiration interval to a value greater than
requested?



>From RFC 3261 (Section 10.3):
The registrar MAY choose an expiration less than the requested
         expiration interval.  If and only if the requested expiration
         interval is greater than zero AND smaller than one hour AND
         less than a registrar-configured minimum, the registrar MAY
         reject the registration with a response of 423 (Interval Too
         Brief).  This response MUST contain a Min-Expires header field
         that states the minimum expiration interval the registrar is
         willing to honor.

RFC 3261 says that the registrar may choose an expiration less than the
requested expiration interval.  It does not say that the registrar may
choose an expiration more than the requested expiration interval.

No. There may be reasons why the client wants its registration to expire 
in a short time. Its better to play it safe by making the client do 
something active to keep its registration, rather than doing something 
active to remove it.

One way to look at this would be to define the Registrar's behavior in
such a way that it has complete control over the registration period
regardless of the expiration duration clients put in their REGISTER
requests. Just like a Registrar has valid reasons to lower the
registration period, it may have valid reasons to up the registration
period.=20

Let's say a Registrar is getting swamped with registration refresh
requests and the resultant read and write operations on the Location
Service database. To combat this, the registrar decides to up the
registration period. While some clients may be able to honor this, some
clients (for good reasons) may not be able to honor this. The clients
that are able to honor this will back off and that will manifest as
reduced load on the Registrar.=20
=20
If a client, such as one behind a NAT, is not able to honor this it can
still go ahead and refresh bindings as frequently as it deems necessary.
I don't think RFC 3261 disallows the client from refreshing
registrations, for instance, every 60 seconds if the registration
expiration period reported by the Registrar was 3600 seconds. If we want
to somewhat relieve the registrar from frequent read and write
operations into the location service, then the client can issue
registration queries instead, which is a read-only operation. =20

I think by giving Registrar a complete control over the registration
period, it helps the Registrar to deal with certain situations and it
also makes it less confusing to describe/implement the registration
period negotiation between the client and the Registrar.=20

Just a thought,
Rajnish

Maybe I just don't understand your use case but there
is nothing stopping the registrar from controlling the refresh
rate. If it wants a lower value, it just lowers it. If it wants
a higher value, it sends a 423 with a Min-Expires header.

True, but I think that negotiation is somewhat rigid. If a client is not
able to honor the Min-Expires period in the 423 response for whatever
reason then it will not be able to register at all.=20

A subtle variation could be that the client is given the freedom to
refresh/query registrations as frequently as it wants, even though the
Registrar only needs to track a bigger expiration period. This is
basically stating that given the current mechanisms in RFC 3261, one can
build a client that will honor the Min-Expires reported in 423 and will
then register for the appropriate duration. However, it can then send
registration queries to the Registrar as frequently as it wants.=20

It is a problem local to the client that it wants to refresh frequently.
Why should the Registrar be burdened with that and forced to run a
smaller timer than it needs to? The NAT scenario would be an exception
to this because in that case the Registrar would want to run the same
timer that the client is running, so that if the client ever became
inaccessible it can be marked so in the location service.=20

Maybe I just don't understand your use case but there
is nothing stopping the registrar from controlling the refresh
rate. If it wants a lower value, it just lowers it. If it wants
a higher value, it sends a 423 with a Min-Expires header.

One way to look at this would be to define the Registrar's behavior in
such a way that it has complete control over the registration period
regardless of the expiration duration clients put in their REGISTER
requests. Just like a Registrar has valid reasons to lower the
registration period, it may have valid reasons to up the registration
period.=20

Let's say a Registrar is getting swamped with registration refresh
requests and the resultant read and write operations on the Location
Service database. To combat this, the registrar decides to up the
registration period. While some clients may be able to honor this, some
clients (for good reasons) may not be able to honor this. The clients
that are able to honor this will back off and that will manifest as
reduced load on the Registrar.=20
=20
If a client, such as one behind a NAT, is not able to honor this it can
still go ahead and refresh bindings as frequently as it deems necessary.
I don't think RFC 3261 disallows the client from refreshing
registrations, for instance, every 60 seconds if the registration
expiration period reported by the Registrar was 3600 seconds. If we want
to somewhat relieve the registrar from frequent read and write
operations into the location service, then the client can issue
registration queries instead, which is a read-only operation. =20

I think by giving Registrar a complete control over the registration
period, it helps the Registrar to deal with certain situations and it
also makes it less confusing to describe/implement the registration
period negotiation between the client and the Registrar.=20

Just a thought,
Rajnish

No. There may be reasons why the client wants its registration to expire

in a short time. Its better to play it safe by making the client do=20
something active to keep its registration, rather than doing something=20
active to remove it.

I don't see what the point of all this is.  If the registrar is getting
overwhelmed, allowing it the luxury of setting longer timers while still
having to cope with the same frequency of REGISTER messages will make
little difference.

As Shaun Bharrat says, SIP provides the 423 response so the registrar
can demand that the UA registers for a longer period, which seems to
solve the problem you stated at the beginning.

If the UA is incapable of registering for longer periods, there is no
solution to the problem.  So the best result is to have the UA not
registered at all, to increase the chance that the user will notice the
problem and take corrective action.

In any case, SIP has clearly defined rules for how registrars and UAs
should behave.  If you'd like to propose an upward-compatible change
that would be an improvement, please do so...

Dale

[Xiao] I fully agree with you. I guess that Nataraju points to a particular
instance for SIP stack.
For UAS, the retransmissions of 2xx response are handled by TU, but the
requests are handled by server transaction(ST). For a  particular instance,
drop re-INVITE before ACK is very simple on coding, but to SIP protocol
handles  re-INVITE before ACK not only dropping is logical and not very
complex.

[Xiao] I know your meaning. What time does UAC send re-INVITE after ACK has
not a exact time. I think this may be a regulative parameter for user that
people can base on a average value of TTL between UACs and UASs add T1, and
set this value to SIP stack.

Why not?  If the rule for UAC above were followed, a re-INVITE would
*ONLY* be sent if the 200 OK had been received.  Thus, receipt of the
re-INVITE also implies the UAC received the 200 OK.  This is straight
forward logic contingent on that UAC behavior.

[ABN] if we decide to accept the re-INVITE, before ACK might lead to a
loop hole in the implementations where your stack assumes ACK is
received but actually not. This might lead some scenarios use to happen
in 2543 complaint stacks (INVITE, CANCEL scenarios, I mean 200 for
CANCEL closes INV transaction also)

[ABN] its always preferred to make sure you have got what you want
within yourself instead of assuming other entity might have sent but not
been received...

This internal ACK_Expected flag would only be needed if the ACK needed
to carry an SDP Answer as in Case 2 below.

I think RFC-3261 could be more rigorous here.  The table in the back
says INVITE responses, period.  I thought it was clear that the UAS upon
sending a 200 OK will need to retransmit that 200 OK, if it doesn't get
an ACK within some timeframe.  The UAC could have sent the ACK and won't
retranmit it unless it gets another 200 OK.  So, there is definitely a
timer for 200 OK retranmits.  I am contending it is Timer G.  If you say
it is not, then please identify the name of the Timer.

[ABN] there is no timer name defined as such, but how often UAS has to
retransmit the 2xx response is mentioned in sec 13.3.1.4.

The table at the end says only brief about the timers being used in SIP
stack implementations... but what is mentioned in the particular section
carries more detailed information...

Michael,

I very much like the way you structurized the problem, it makes it 
very easy to read. Unfortunately the second case doesn't work.

More inline.

Yes, this may work. Although this would be at best seen as 
"optimization" trick in the implementation, not a change in the 
standard. I mean, if you choose to do this, then it may work. If you 
don't want to do this, then it's fine too.

But still I don't like the "implied" bits, it sounds like we're 
violating the standard INVITE cycle. I propose to add additional text 
to your solution:

(UAS): .. But UAS MUST still retransmit the 200 OK until ACK is 
received, and it SHOULD terminate the dialog usage with BYE if ACK is 
not received.

This way we're not violating the standard (I hope).

This will not work in all situations. It will only work in the ideal 
situation where the first 200 OK transmission is received by UAC and 
the ACK is not lost either.

But what if the first three 200 OK responses are lost? The 2*T1 will 
be useless, since the second 200 response seen by UAC will be received 
  2 seconds after it received the first one.

So in general, I think this type of solution will not work, because 
there is no way for UAC to know when the next response will arrive. 
Thus for UAC, the only thing that works is to handle 491 (Request 
Pending) response when it arrives.

BTW, I was not suggesting that this behavior was necessary, only that it
could work.  If from an implementation standpoint, and still compliant
to RFC-3261, you have another way to handle this, then go for it.  The
crux of the matter for me was that there was an open-endedness to when
to send the re-INVITE that could lead to sub-optimal performance from
the user experience in terms of getting the SDP to converge on the
desired stable state, whatever it was that required the re-INVITE.

More in the other emails.

I agree it may be questionable to rely on the compliance of the UAC to
standards.  The re-INVITE MUST not be sent unless the Offer was Answered
in the 200 OK.  I could argue that all bets are off if the UAC is
violating multiple requirements.  But, that is beside the point.  There
is nothing complelling one to do the above optimization.  So, if it
hurts you, don't do it.  :)

I was only suggesting that the sole thing that the ACK tells you is
identical to what the re-INVITE would tell you.  Nothing more.  Of
course, I could be overlooking something.

I re-read the section.  The behavior is identical to the Timer G.  There
seems to be some suggestion that because RFC-3261 split the behavior
into three layers, these timers should be layer specific.  So be it.
Then the Timer table should identify which timers belong to which
layers, and we could call the timer defined in Section 13.3.1.4 Timer G'
or some other letter.  Maybe on the next version.

Agree.  I was only thinking of whether the Post Dial Delay could be
minimized.  I think the implication is sound, but all the same, it is
probably best to verify with continued 200 OK and ACK retransmissions as
you suggest.  It could still be possible that the ACK arrives in time to
end the Timer G' behavior.

You misunderstood the actual suggestion because it was not clearly laid
out.  The idea was that the UAS is going to retransmit 200 OK according
to a Timer G' behavior.  Let us call what the UAC thinks this behavior
is the Timer G".  Assuming T1=3D500 ms, Timer G' at UAS will send 200 OK
at:

Interval: 0, .5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0,  8.0, 16.0
Times:    0, .5, 1.5, 3.5, 7.5, 15.5, 31.5 (Timer H' fires at T1*64=3D32
sec)

Timer G" at UAC can have identical behavior.  Assume one-way transport
time is .1 second.
Interval: 0.0, .5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0,  8.0, 16.0
Times:    0.1, .6, 1.6, 3.6, 7.6, 15.6, 31.6 (Timer H' fires at =
T1*64=3D32
sec)

At time 0 the 200 OK is sent.  At time 0.1 it is received at the UAC.

If the ACK is not received the UAS would send again at time 0.5 and the
UAC would receive it at time 0.6

At time 0.6, if a second 200 OK is received, UAC retransmits the ACK and
sets Timer G"=3D1 so that it fires at time 1.6.

At time 1.6, if a third 200 OK is received, UAC retransmits the ACK and
sets Timer G"=3D2 so that it fires at time 3.6 and so on. =20

This is the theoretical minimum.  The actual suggestion was to start the
Timer G" at 2*T1:
Interval: 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0,  8.0, 16.0
Times:    0.1, 1.1, 3.1, 7.1, 16.1, 32.1 (Timer H" fires at T1*64=3D32
sec)

Compare with the Timer G' behavior adjusted with .1 cross-network
transmit time.
Times:    0.1, .6, 1.6, 3.6, 7.6, 15.6, 31.6 (Timer H' fires at =
T1*64=3D32
sec)

Note that the "200 OK expected" times are increasingly larger than what
the actual 200 OK receipt times at the UAC should be.  The end-game for
Timer H" would need to be handled, but you get the idea now, I hope.

> So in general, I think this type of solution will not work,=20

I would state this the other way.  There is no way for the UAC to know
that the ACK was received and therefore that a 200 OK will not be
forthcoming.  The issue still is answering the question (rather than
waiting some very long time) when is the earliest it is reasonable to
try to send the re-INVITE with high probability of success?

If you send immediately and get a 491 in return, this just puts the UAC
in the same situation of needing to decide when to retranmit.  The ACK
could be received immediately after the 491 was sent.  So, sending the
re-INVITE immediately after ACK has only postponed this decision *IF*
the network delivery and handling at the UAS is misordered. =20

Perhaps a compromise is to wait an RTT before sending the re-INVITE and
allow Timer A to take care of the rest.  (Note Timer A will fire quicker
than Timer G'.)

Michael,

even after your lengthy explanation, I still think it wouldn't work. 
Perhaps it's because I didn't explain it clearly either. More inline.

The problem is, you assumed that timer G" starts in UAC at the same 
time when timer G' starts in UAS. This is not possible (I think). 
Timer G" can only start at UAC when UAC receives the first 2xx 
response. Is this correct, or am I missing something here?

If this is correct, then what if the first 2xx response received by 
UAC is actually the n-th retransmission (because n-1 responses were 
lost). In this case, timer G' and G" won't be synchronized.

Let me illustrate with a diagram. We'll ignore RTT time, for 
simplification.

Time   UAC                          UAS
0.000       lost X <------ 200/OK --
0.500       lost X <------ 200/OK --
1.500       lost X <------ 200/OK --
3.500  <------------------ 200/OK --
        -- ACK -----------> X lost
7.500  <------------------ 200/OK --

At time 3.500, UAC starts timer G". After 2*T1, at time 4.500, UAC 
thinks it's okay to send re-INVITE, because no 200 retransmission is 
received. But this is wrong, since the retransmission WILL be received 
at time 7.500.

Am I missing something?

Yes, Timer G" only gets started once the 200 OK is received and why I
had to include the half RTT.

Yes, I see the problem now.  The UAS is further out in its backoff
interval than the UAC which started its backoff interval later, but more
aggressive.  Thus, the UAC would always beat the UAS to the punch.  Of
course once you have two 200 OKs, you would know where in this sequence
you were, but that is too complex.

This suggested hypothetical behavior would work better (thinking out
loud) if Timer G' and G" were more like Timer E and retrans at MIN(2*T1,
T2), that is at regular intervals.  Or, even just define a T5 value say,
2 seconds, with no back off. =20

Makes me wonder if INVITE response retransmissions in general should not
exhibit a backoff.  That is Timer G, G', G" should all be at some fixed
interval.  This would speed up comletion of the INVITE transaction.
But, that would require a change to RFC-3261.  Would have to think what
the downside to that is.

The current alternative seems to be keep pounding the UAS with
re-INVITEs until one gets through.  That is more brute force and would
seem to aggravate overload conditions.

BTW, I can't claim any credit for this Timer G" idea, I was only
following through the thought introduced earlier by someone else.

Hi;
For example user Tom is registered to Proxy1 from different devices.
Proxy1 receives an incoming INVITE for Tom and starts forking the INVITE 
to all
the registered devices.

Now, my question.

Tom doesn't want to answer, but to reject the call ( some 4xx final 
response for example).
But he can not reject the call from all the devices, because he only has 
access to one of them.

How can Tom sends a response to Proxy1 to:
1- Reject the call ( send to caller non-2xx final response ) and at the 
same time
2- Cancel all pending Client transactions

Thanks;
Diego B

A 6xx response will cause the proxy server to CANCEL all other branches of 
the fork.

>From RFC 3261, section 16.7:

  If a 6xx response is received, it is not immediately forwarded,
  but the stateful proxy SHOULD cancel all client pending
  transactions as described in Section 10, and it MUST NOT create
  any new branches in this context.

Subject: [Sip-implementors] Providing Delayed Call Information

Hi,

I want to solve the following problem.  A large number of the calls that
we get from our providers have all the calling information present
(i.e. the name of the caller, or CNAM if you wish), but some of the calls
don't have that present.  We have several alternative sources for calling
name information that we consult to populate that name (caches, databases,
etc.) but that lookup can take "time" (not a long time, but not
instantaneous).

The problem is, I don't want to hold back the INVITE until I get that
information back; it could take like 100ms or so depending on the source
and I am not willing to wait.  I want to send out the INVITE to the UAC
and when the calling name information has been determined, send that to
update the information that was in the INVITE.  As an example, for any of
you Q.931/850 types out there, it would be the same as getting the Setup
message without a calling name and getting a Facility message sometime
later on with that name.

I initially thought that the UPDATE method was what I wanted, but after
actually reading the RFC, it's not at all what I want.  I then thought
that I wanted an INVITE/Replaces, but that seems to me like using a
sledgehammer to hang a picture :)  and I'm not really sure it would have
the desired effect.

So, I need to know if this is already "handled" in SIP.  I can't find
anything that suggests how to do this and even though I could add support
in our systems for a custom method that would allow this, I would rather
not if the problem has already been solved.

Suggestions?   Thanks in advance!

David

My problem is that sometimes what might be responding might be an
automated system.  It may also be just one piece of a chain of systems
that are working together to provide a service; 100ms is a long time when
you are talking latency.  So, in short, we can't wait.  100ms is a LONG
time; we can serve about 2000 other things in that time, and the more
things I can do in parallel the better.

Most of the time the systems I'm talking to get the initial trying back to
me in about 2ms.  Waiting an additional 498ms to move to the next step of
processing is not an option.  Relying on the resends should _only_ be used
to deal with failures i.e. packet loss, which on "good" networks doesn't
really happen.

The entire crux of my problem is that I don't want to wait.  I want to
provide updated information to the callee about the caller.  Even the POTS
does this type of thing out to your phone... it sends the initial voltage
to make your phone ring and then sends the calling information in the
WINK... Surely we should be able to this within SIP.

Here is another example of why I would want this.  Perhaps the "system" I
consult is actually the caller.  Sometimes we ask the caller if they would
like to provide calling information.  For example, based on the
preferences of the called party we may ask the caller if they want to
"lift" their privacy (if the callee doesn't accept calls from unknown
parties).  That's a LOT of latency.  And again, the act of providing this
information doesn't constitute a new call, but simply changes some of the
attributes of an existing call.

If all else fails, I would be willing to work on a draft of how to support
this type of update.

Certainly we would parallelize the requests and have, like you say,
thousands of these outstanding.  That is the current approach, and it
works.  I just don't like it.  I would rather have a system that can
provide updates.  We can provide updates to the media, why not the caller
info?

Agreed, it might.  However, the large majority of such interactions happen
with a real person and not with an automated system.

I guess the answer I'm getting in that this type of thing is not really
handled, and the details of any method of providing such updates would
have to be explored.

It's a B2BUA.  In terms of using a re-INVITE, I want to present the
updated information _before_ the call is answered, so that's a no go.
That's also why I had initially looked into using the UPDATE method, but,
sadly, that doesn't seem to be able to affect anything but the media
parameters.

Any chance UPDATE could be updated to do so?

There has been discussion on changing UPDATE to be able to modify some of
the non dialog forming information, or at least making UPDATE clearer about
what it means if various bits of information changing from the INVITE to the
UPDATE. I hope this work does happen,  however, I don't think this would
solve your problem...

It sounds like you have a problem where you are trying to modify the From
information before the the dialog is formed and UPDATE won't work in that
case. I also doubt that adding 100 ms to the post dial delay time will
really matter. Consider if your SIP device that is doing this lookup for the
CNAM was instead doing a DNS look up to resolve the host it was going to
send to. The DNS lookup could take way more than 100 ms. Your SIP server
would not stop doing the 2000 other things while this lookup happened - it
would keep doing them and wait for the response from the lookup then
continue with the processing. SIP servers do this all the time and it seem
to work fine.

UPDATE can basically update everything that a re-INVITE can.  However if I
recall correctly, some on the sip list view the concepts of updating
identities and retargeting as evil.

The topic was discussed within the following thread.

But that list is the

Call-ID
To
 From (and tag)
CSeq

and this "problem" seems to want to modify the From (and From tag) fields, 
which makes UPDATE and reINVITE each a non-starter.

I agree that no RFC has yet obsoleted the RFC 3261 backward =
compatibility
requirement concerning changing To and From URIs.  And I do not recall =
if
RFC 3261 has the same requirement concerning the display name of the To =
and
From.

If the devices support the various identity extensions (or changing =
display
names is valid), using UPDATE might solve the problem.

Per RFC 3891 section 4, INVITE with Replaces MUST NOT be sent to replace =
an
early dialog unless the receiver originated the dialog to be replaced.  =
It
indicates forking as the reason.  Thus the "sledgehammer" approach which =
was
mentioned is also not currently valid (unless the restriction is removed =
by
another RFC).

But if the issue is providing information in "trusted" headers, isn't
the From a non-starter?

Wouldn't SASL or some P-header approach be the focus of attention?

Are you suggesting an assertion after the initial INVITE?

This is an interesting thought on the surface

David,

If the intention is to provide the identity (name) to the called party, so
that it can be used to take a decision whether to answer the call or not etc
then it needs to be included in the Invite message.

And BTW in the Traditional PSTN world the called party is not alerted until
the caller-id info (name) is fetched from the LIDB database.

So withholding an Invite and launching a Query to get the name is not a Bad
idea. 
At the same time the caller can be returned a 100 trying or a provisional
response equilvalent to Call-Proceeding  (without SDP even when PRACK is
enabled and Invite is received w/o SDP ).

This way the UAC can be satisfied not to Retransmit and at the same time if
the UAC also can be enabled to  play a local call-setup tone to satisfy the
caller's ear.  

Kasturi

Subject: [Sip-implementors] Providing Delayed Call Information

Hi,

I want to solve the following problem.  A large number of the calls that
we get from our providers have all the calling information present
(i.e. the name of the caller, or CNAM if you wish), but some of the calls
don't have that present.  We have several alternative sources for calling
name information that we consult to populate that name (caches, databases,
etc.) but that lookup can take "time" (not a long time, but not
instantaneous).

The problem is, I don't want to hold back the INVITE until I get that
information back; it could take like 100ms or so depending on the source
and I am not willing to wait.  I want to send out the INVITE to the UAC
and when the calling name information has been determined, send that to
update the information that was in the INVITE.  As an example, for any of
you Q.931/850 types out there, it would be the same as getting the Setup
message without a calling name and getting a Facility message sometime
later on with that name.

I initially thought that the UPDATE method was what I wanted, but after
actually reading the RFC, it's not at all what I want.  I then thought
that I wanted an INVITE/Replaces, but that seems to me like using a
sledgehammer to hang a picture :)  and I'm not really sure it would have
the desired effect.

So, I need to know if this is already "handled" in SIP.  I can't find
anything that suggests how to do this and even though I could add support
in our systems for a custom method that would allow this, I would rather
not if the problem has already been solved.

Suggestions?   Thanks in advance!

David

Hi All,

I just submitted a new draft defining extensions to SIP events for 
allowing conditional subscribes:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt

The issue this attempts to fix were documented in a sipping draft [1], 
and discussed in IETF 63. My impression of that discussion was moderate 
interest, so here's the mechanism proposal.

Comments are very welcome.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi All,

I have one question regarding to TLS and SIPS.

Per RFC 3261, if SIPS URI is used as the R-URI, it indicates all the 
signaling hop (except the last one to the UAS) must be secured by TLS.  
I'm doubting if the converse is true. If transport protocol is TLS, does 
thisimply R-URI and/or topmost route is SIPS?

RFC 3263 (locating SIP server) has one requirement:
    RFC 3263 Section 4.1, 1st paragraph on page 7.
    First, a client resolving a SIPS URI MUST discard any services that
    do not contain "SIPS" as the protocol in the service field.  *The
    converse is not true, however.  A client resolving a SIP URI SHOULD
    retain records with "SIPS" as the protocol, if the client supports
    TLS.
*
If the client retain the DNS records with "SIPS" even when the input to 
DNS is SIP URI, it may use the TLS for the transport if the client 
supports TLS. My question is -- will UE promote the R-URI (or topmost 
route) from SIP URI to SIPS URI after selecting TLS as the transport 
protocol. Result of DNS query shall not modify the DNS input (R-URI or 
topmost URI), but do the promotion or not is not clearly specified in 
either 3263 and 3261 and client behavior may be different.

One potential approach of using SIP URI over TLS is using the security 
negotiation.

    RFC 3329. Section 2.4 "security mechanism initiation" specified:
    If "tls" is chosen, the client uses the procedures of Section 8.1.2
    of rfc 3261 to determine the URI to be used as an input to the DNS
    procedures of rfc3263.  However, if the URI is a SIP URI, it MUST
    treat the scheme as if it were sips, not sip.  If the URI scheme is
    not sip, the request MUST be sent using TLS.
   
    The example in section 4.1 shows SIP URI is used after TLS is 
established as the result of security negotiation.
   
   And, RFC 3329 section 2.3.1 specified
   If a client ends up using TLS to contact the server because it has
   followed the rules specified in [5], the client MUST NOT use the
   security agreement procedure of this specification.  If a client ends
   up using non-TLS connections because of the rules in [5], the client
   MAY use the security agreement of this specification to detect DNS
   spoofing, or to negotiate some other security than TLS.

So, SIPS URI shall not allow security negotiation, and SIP URI may use 
the TLS after security negotiation. Can we assume that SIP URI not SIPS 
URI shall be used for security negotiation (even when TLS is selected as 
the result of negotiation)? And, there is a similar question, will the 
UE promote the R-URI from SIP to SIPS URI, once TLS is selected.

Thanks,
Bourne

Looks like there is some confusion on this timers.

1. You are right. Timers need not be of the same value
on UAS and UAC and need not start at the same time.

2. The discussion was if sending a Re-Invite
immediately to ACK was correct.

3. The question as to what would happen if the 'n'th
200 Ok was the one received by the UAC. In this case,
till the UAC recevies a 200 Ok , it wont send a ACK
and neither an Re-invite.So no problem as this is not
the issue we are discussing.

So my suggestion was merely that, whenever the UAC
recevied a 200 Ok, it would send ACK. Before initating
a reinvite if UAC waited for atleast  2*T1 (with T1
being UAC value and started after sending ACK), then
atleast 1 200 Ok retransmission would be recevied if
UAS never recevied ACK and then the UAC can safely
send Re-Invite without worrying about the UAS
problems.

Hope this clarifies.

Thanks,
Srinidhi

There is some confusion about what does 2*T1 mean.  I think the intent
of the language in RFC 3261 was that a given timer would copy the
configured value of T1=3D0.5 sec, then timer x variable gets doubled =
after
each iteration.  So, T1 remains a constant, but the timer start value
doubles each time.

That said, what I think you are saying is that what I called Timer G"
exhibits this behavior:
Interval: 0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, ...
Times:    0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, ... until BYE received or 7
ACKs sent

Event [re-]setting timer:  receipt of 200 OK and sending of ACK
Event upon timer expiry:  Send re-INVITE
Event disabling timer:  7 ACKs sent or BYE received

Does that capture it?

Mike

We have discussed that this wouldn't work in all cases, and the 
example that I've given has proved it. If you care to read my post 
again carefully, perhaps you'll come to the same conclussion. Or 
perhaps no, in that case I'll be glad to hear it.

Dear Neimi, 

Please find some comments on the draft
"draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt"

1. If I understand correctly, if the e-tags match between the SUBSCRIBE
requests and the one available with NOTIFIER, then the notify request
need not carry the message body (carrying the current state of the
event). 
	But in section 4.3 Suppressing NOTIFY Bodies section, it's been
mentioned as if the entity-tags do not match, the notifier MUST
suppress the body of the resulting NOTIFY request... 

Suggestion 1:  when the suppression has to happen, can we suppress the
whole NOTIFY message instead of only body of the NOTIFY request... since
NOTIFY is not a mandatory request for each successful subscription... 

Suggestion 2: when the suppression has to happen, can we return a
success response (for instance 203 "Subscription extended" or some thing
similar reason phrase) instead or 412 response... ?

<<<<<<<<<
Suggestion 3: to fetch or poll for the subscription state, overload the
SUBSCRIBE header and add a parameter in event header which specifies
fetch the current state of the subscription. Similarly we can add one
more parameter value for poll operation also... 
			OR
Other option would be we can add one more header which specifies action
like fetch, poll, subscribe, terminate
	Subscribe-Action: "subscribe"/"fetch"/"poll"/"terminate"....
>>>>>>>

We also need to describe the notifier behavior for all these
operations....

Thanks & Regards,
Nataraju A.B.

Hi All,

I just submitted a new draft defining extensions to SIP events for 
allowing conditional subscribes:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-sip-subnot-etags-00.txt

The issue this attempts to fix were documented in a sipping draft [1], 
and discussed in IETF 63. My impression of that discussion was moderate 
interest, so here's the mechanism proposal.

Comments are very welcome.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi Nataraju,

Uhh, it should say that if the condition fails, i.e., the entity-tags 
*do* match (since the condition was a if-none-match), then the NOTIFY is 
suppressed.

Thanks for catching this.

Actually, the NOTIFY is mandatory after each successful subscribe. So 
that doesn't really work but...

> Suggestion 2: when the suppression has to happen, can we return a
> success response (for instance 203 "Subscription extended" or some thing
> similar reason phrase) instead or 412 response... ?

...this is another alternative, and the next best one after suppressing 
just the NOTIFY body. That is, we definitely want a 2xx for the 
SUBSCRIBE, so that the expiry can be extended, even if the conditional 
request fails.

But the problem is that RFC3265 says a NOTIFY must always follow a 2xx 
to a SUBSCRIBE; the request also contains the Subscription-State header 
field, which contains relevant state information. So it seems the NOTIFY 
simply can't be suppressed totally, and we have to make due with 
suppressing just the body.

> <<<<<<<<<

I don't quite follow. This is the default operation anyway, i.e., a 
SUBSCRIBE with Expires: 0 fetches the current state without creating a 
subscription.

What the etags allow is to communicate which version of state the 
fetcher already has possession of, so that it need not be sent again.

> 			OR
> Other option would be we can add one more header which specifies action

> 	Subscribe-Action: "subscribe"/"fetch"/"poll"/"terminate"....

This is all there already, and depends on the Expires header field value 
of the SUBSCRIBE. Perhaps it could have been clearer to define specific 
methods for these operations, but this is the age-old debate about which 
is better:

	do(method, params)

vs.

	do_method(params)

Both work.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi,
=20
In the first version "SIP Torture test messages draft "
(http://www.iptel.org/info/players/ietf/callflows/draft-ietf-sipping-tor
ture-tests-00.txt
<http://www.iptel.org/info/players/ietf/callflows/draft-ietf-sipping-tor
ture-tests-00.txt> ), there was a test case "2.15 INVITE with Invalid
Via and Contact Headers" and for this test case, the expected behavior
stated was " The server should respond with a Bad Request error."=20
=20
Later I found that, this particular test case is missing in the latest
versions of the draft (from 01 to latest, this test case is missing).
On analysing the test message, this is what I inferred :
=20
" When we have parsing errors in the VIA header field, we do not send
any error response back because we need the values from the VIA header
to send the response back for that request as according to the RFC, so
in this case we are not able to send any response back. The possible
solutions that we could have is to send the response back using CONTACT
header value or we could send it back from the IP address it came from,
but both these methods can have serious side effects on the intermediate
proxies in certain cases.So, it is better to ignore the INVITE message
with invalid Via or contact header fields rather than sending Bad
request error. "=20
=20
I want to know, whether my inference on this test case is correct? Also,
other than this, is there any particular reason for removal of this test
case in the later versions?=20
=20
Regards,
Andal.

More than 500 participants will attend International SIP and the WiMAX
Summit next February 21st to 24th in Paris.

 


Registration is still open for both events.

 

The 7th edition of the International SIP conference program is mainly
dedicated to IMS architectures and Peer-to-Peer communications:

 <http://www.upperside.fr/sip2006/sip2006intro.htm>
http://www.upperside.fr/sip2006/sip2006intro.htm

 

The 3rd WiMAX Summit is largely devoted to case studies presented by both
incumbent and new entrant operators:

Close to the conference rooms an exhibition welcomes industrials involved in
VoIP and wireless broadband access.
