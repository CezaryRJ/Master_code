I think it was the hope of the authors that all of the meaningful values for
'base' would be characterized in the document. Since 'base' reflects the
lowest common dominator (or, to coin a phrase, least specific ancestor)
variant of the ISUP version in question, the authors hoped that given the
backwards compatibility mechanism in ITU-T 1992 Q.76x, itu92 would be the
proper base for forthcoming ISUP versions (new versions of ANSI following
the 2000 issue support this mechanism, even).

That much said, if there are potential 'base' values which are of use to the
community that cannot be said to derive from itu92, the authors would
certainly like to be made aware of them. Is there anything out there that
the ISUP MIME draft misses?

In the face of serious concerns that useful new 'bases' might come to light
subsequent to the publication of an RFC, I suppose management of 'base' by
IANA could be introduced, but personally I'd rather not trouble IANA with
this additional responsibility if there isn't a substantial risk. Was there
anything specific you had in mind?

Currently, the IANA considerations section of 
draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-07.txt describes how to define new "version" 
fields, but does not describe how to define new "base" fields.

Given that new base protocols may be identified, shouldn't there be a 
description on how IANA assigns new "base" values?

Agreed.  For many advanced PBX features the switchhook+DTMF 
interface sucks.  In this case the legacy PSTN paradigm
is not DTMF.  Digital PBX phones use additional
keys and a display.

If the SIP side of the gateway is retaining state then the UAS side has to know
that the subsequent
digits have to be sent to the same call state machine (on the ISUP side) as the
original digits. If you
choose a different UAS, and the INVITE containing susequent digits is treated as
a new call attempt
by this UAS, how does it know which state machine on the ISUP side to send the
digits to. I'm thinking
of a configuration where there exists a farm of UAS for scalability and load
distribution.

Originally, I did say that sending 484 and completely forgetting about the call
would work, I just don't think
it is the best way; the original state machine on the ISUP side would probably
time out if it received no
further digits and a new state machine created by the subsequent INVITE would
now handle the call.

In the case of 11.3 in the sip-isup document, then the subsequent INVITEs must
arrive at the same gateway,
otherwise unnecessary IAMs are generated. This is pointed out in the text.

K. Robinson

I think you've made one assumption I might question.  Assuming that
subsequent INVITEs are being sent, containing all of the digits so far
collected, so that they are self-contained: why is it necessary that each
ends up at the same UAS?  When the 484 is sent back, call state should be
cleared all along the path, even in the SIP-UAC side of the ingress gateway.
Only the ISUP side of that gateway and, I suppose, the ISUP-SIP interworking
function, should retain call state.

> Greetings,

> I would like to ask for clarification regarding the implementation of
> Overlap.
>
> I'll begin by referring to paragraph 3, section 6.1.2 of
> "draft-ietf-isup-sip-00":
>
> It is stated that INVITEs sent after the first one
> (containing extra digits
> in the 'To' field) are to be treated as new Call-Legs, seeing as the
> contents of their 'To' headers differ. As such, there is no
> relationship
> between their CSeq values.
>
> If this is the case, how is it possible to ensure correct
> digit ordering
> over an 'unreliable' transport layer like UDP? It would seem
> logical that
> the call originator _would_ use contiguous CSeq values, as it would be
> 'aware' of the fact that the INVITEs are for the same call.
>
> I believe that this issue was raised on the SIP list on 19

I suspect I sit somewhere between Henning and Mike in my attitude towards
crypto; I've found myself becoming a strong advocate of TLS for inter-proxy
communication, but I'm still not sure I believe its going to solve the
problems to client to proxy authentication/confidentiality (lack of client
certs being a real problem). There, digest has, for better or for worse,
been used by many vendors. So, from a purely educational standpoint, I'd
like additional clarification on its weaknesses, and why it is "worse than
nothing". As far as I can tell, it does prevent replays (since it uses
nonces which rotate frequently), does not expose plaintext passwords, etc.
It is possible to modify messages in transit to change headers not covered,
I'll give you that. Digest in 2617 does allow for the hash to cover the
body, though, so this helps some. 2617 also does allow for response hashes,
although I have not used it and don't know what problems it has. 

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

I disagree with this.  I think it is fine for a proxy to pull
responses "out of the air".  What's it's not allowed to do is
modify fundamental transaction-identifying headers (From, To,
Call-ID, CSeq, Via immediately spring to mind).

Okay, I would agree that this -- the way that you describe it,
anyway -- cannot be done without a B2BUA.  However, Session
Timer might go some way towards achieving similar goals....

Base CPL does not offer a way to describe how to achieve all of
these things; however, I would say that it is still acceptable
for a proxy to do any of them.

That maybe so.  I must admit that I'm not sure knowing that
something is a proxy or a B2BUA is helpful anyway.  I don't
really care what it is, as long as it performs the services
I think are neat.

Cheers,

This is not a B2BUA as it does not require a UAS|UAC
state machine. This is a stateful proxy operating in 
the same way that it does to filter multiple responses 
after forking. Where the 3xx arrives at the proxy 
from is irrelevant.

Forwarding to voicemail on 4xx/6xx is trivial with CPL. It 
can direct the proxy to send the INVITE on to the VM server,
this avoid having to send back a 3xx.

You have referred to this model before but never explained 
what the additional stateless proxies in the middle are 
needed for?

Also this is not the model that I recall seeing in the DCS
drafts. In that things like the privacy reqs that could be
better guaranteed through B2BUAs were being required of proxies.

I see the disconnect here.  You are assuming that the first IAM gets
propagated through the egress gateway, so an ISUP state machine is set into
play.  I think the synthesis of our thinking is this:

(1) The first problem is to receive enough digits so an egress gateway can
be selected.  Until that happens, the digits have to be accumulated into
successive initial INVITE messages.

(2) Once an egress gateway has been selected, call routing is complete as
far as the SIP domain is concerned.  Hence it is legitimate to use the INFO
method to carry subsequent digits.

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of a configuration where there exists a farm of =
UAS for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; scalability and load</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; distribution.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Originally, I did say that sending 484 and =
completely </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; forgetting about the call</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; would work, I just don't think</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it is the best way; the original state machine =
on the ISUP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; side would probably</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; time out if it received no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; further digits and a new state machine created =
by the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; subsequent INVITE would</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; now handle the call.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; In the case of 11.3 in the sip-isup document, =
then the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; subsequent INVITEs must</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; arrive at the same gateway,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; otherwise unnecessary IAMs are generated. This =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I have recently been trying to get =
clarification on the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; implemenation of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; overlap sending; see attached for the =
discussion that has </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; taken place</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; so far.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Certainly, the mechanism outlined (very =
sketchily) in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; RFC2543bis-02 sect 4.2.1</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; is fundamentally flawed. The Request-URI =
cannot be used to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; carry extra digits</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; as the Record-Route/Route mechanism would =
end up </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; overwriting the R-URI</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; and therefore the subsequent digits would =
be lost.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; This then leads to the idea of using the =
TO field as described in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; sip-isup-00-00.txt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; however, I have the following issues with =
the mechanisms</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; described in this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; document :</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; As the TO field is different on each =
subsequent INVITE, then</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; it is a new call</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; leg</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; on an existing call id; RFC2543bis-02 =
sect. 11.5 does not</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; state what a UAS</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; should make of this. If you follow the =
logic in 11.5 you get</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to case (3), but</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; here it only defines the behaviour&nbsp; =
if the TO and FROM fields match.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; The 484 sent backwards kills that call =
attempt (but not the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; state for that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Call-Id -</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; is this problematic for intermediate =
proxies ?) so subsequent</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INVITEs will</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; actually be initial INVITEs. As these =
INVITEs must get to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; same terminating</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; UAS,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the originating&nbsp; UAC will have to =
create a ROUTE header in an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; initial INVITE</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; using ,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; at least the CONTACT address from the 484. =
This implies the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; use of source</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; routing, an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; issue that I don't believe has been fully =
resolved, and even</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; if it is and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; becomes part</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; of the base protocol some administrations =
may be reluctant to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; admit initial</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INVITEs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; which try to circumvent their routing =
policy, so may reject</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; such INVITEs.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Also on the above point, the CONTACT =
address in the 484 must</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; have the same</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; semantics as that in a 200 response so =
that a ROUTE header</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; can be built; however</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; RFC2543bis-02 sect. 6.14 specifies that a =
CONTACT address in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 4XX responses</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; indicates a location where additional =
error information can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; be found. Indeed, in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; a recent</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; thread entitled Announcements in SIP (401 =
&amp; 407 Contact) J.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Rosenberg believes</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Record-Route does not make sense in any =
non-200 response.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I would raise the question of whether the =
484 response has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; any use in overlap</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; sending</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (certainly in the case of ISUP) at all. If =
a node receives</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; insufficient digits</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to decode than it will wait until it =
receives some more from</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the preceding node</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (or end of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; dialling timers mature). If the preceding =
node receives</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; subsequent digits and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; end of dialling</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; has not been detected then it will pass =
them on. If the 484</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; indicated the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; minimum number of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digits before a decode could take place, =
then it would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; useful in cutting down</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the number</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; of subseqent messages sent.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Indeed, isup-sip-00.txt does cover the =
mechanism where a 183</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; is sent, and not a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 484.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; The case in point is covered in sect. 11.3 =
(Example of SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; bridging and overlap</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; signalling);</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; However, I have the following issues with =
this mechanism:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; As before relies on source routing.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Relies on proxies sending requests on new =
call legs but</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; existing call-ids to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; same</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; downstream server; fine if you administer =
these proxies, what</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; if you don't ?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (Lots of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; wasted IAMs generated). The mechanism =
should not send 5</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (subsequent INVITE)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; until it has received an acknowledgement =
(probably not 100)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; from the first.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Alternatively,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the Reason-Phrase could detail more =
specifically the exact</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; progress of the call</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (&quot;Decoding Address&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; in this case ?) so that the ACM is not =
generated unconditionally.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Sect. 11.2 encourages gateways &quot;to =
return a183 Session</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Progress with a Contact</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; header as soon as they receive an INVITE =
that they are going</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to handle and might</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; contain</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an incomplete number&quot;. Presumably =
this is to allow the UAC to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; build a ROUTE so</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that subsequent</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INVITEs get to the appropriate UAS. Sect =
7.2.3 indicates that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; a node receiving a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 183 prior to generating</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an ACM should generate an ACM. Applied =
together these rules</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; may cause a prior</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; node to never</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; send on any subsequent digits and overlap =
sending would fail.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I think an approach is required whereby =
subsequent digits are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; sent on the same</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; call leg as the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; initial INVITE; either multiple INVITEs =
are allowed before</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 200 OK (already</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; suggested by J. Rosenberg</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; in a different context) , or the INFO =
method is used. In both</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; cases the TO field</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; will have to remain the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; same so a new header (or message body =
type) is required to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; convey the digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Also, replace the 484</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; with, say, 18X indicating the minimum =
number of digits</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; required, perhaps in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Reason-Phrase header.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Greetings,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I would like to ask for clarification =
regarding the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; implementation of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Overlap.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I'll begin by referring to paragraph 3, =
section 6.1.2 of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &quot;draft-ietf-isup-sip-00&quot;:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; It is stated that INVITEs sent after the =
first one</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (containing extra digits</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; in the 'To' field) are to be treated as =
new Call-Legs, seeing as the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; contents of their 'To' headers differ. As =
such, there is no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; relationship</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; between their CSeq values.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; If this is the case, how is it possible to =
ensure correct</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digit ordering</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; over an 'unreliable' transport layer like =
UDP? It would seem</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; logical that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the call originator _would_ use contiguous =
CSeq values, as </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 'aware' of the fact that the INVITEs are =
for the same call.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I believe that this issue was raised on =
the SIP list on 19</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; November 1999 by</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Gonzalo C and Jonathan R. The subject of =
the messages was</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &quot;Re: Comments on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; =
draft-camarillo-mmusic-sip-isup-bcp-00.txt&quot;. The outcome of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the exchange</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; appeared to be an agreement that CSeq =
ordering should be employed.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; However, does this in any way imply that =
under such </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; circumstances the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INVITEs would/should belong to the same =
Call-Leg? After all,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the concept of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Overlap does not seem to 'fit in' with the =
concept behind</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; multiple Call-Legs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; anyway.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; If there has been a change in thinking =
behind the problem,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; and the latest</FONT>

Hi,

I am writing for the first time on this mailing list. So, hoping to get the
answer.
I have a very basic question. 
I understand SIP is useful for inter-MGC communication as well as for
tunneling of PSTN signalling across IP network.
But when we talk about SIP phone or residential gateways... Is SIP better
than MGCP or Megaco? If yes, then how ?
Is there any document which goes into detail about SIP and MGCP/Megaco
comparison?

Moreover, Is there any work going on for SIP trunking gateway?

regards

-nitin

Jon,
I do not agree with your comments. I think ITU-T ISUP 2000 should be the
base,
as it is the base going forward. ITU-T ISUP 2000 is backwards compatible
with
previous versions such as ISUP '92. The options in ITU-T ISUP 2000 that
would
not need to be specified for this activity could be highlighted as not
mandatory.
The ANSI version of ISUP is T1.113 and has been updated to the ITU-T ISUP
2000 
level and is in the final stages for publication.

Subject: RE: [SIP] Question on "base" in draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-07.txt


I think it was the hope of the authors that all of the meaningful values for
'base' would be characterized in the document. Since 'base' reflects the
lowest common dominator (or, to coin a phrase, least specific ancestor)
variant of the ISUP version in question, the authors hoped that given the
backwards compatibility mechanism in ITU-T 1992 Q.76x, itu92 would be the
proper base for forthcoming ISUP versions (new versions of ANSI following
the 2000 issue support this mechanism, even).

That much said, if there are potential 'base' values which are of use to the
community that cannot be said to derive from itu92, the authors would
certainly like to be made aware of them. Is there anything out there that
the ISUP MIME draft misses?

In the face of serious concerns that useful new 'bases' might come to light
subsequent to the publication of an RFC, I suppose management of 'base' by
IANA could be introduced, but personally I'd rather not trouble IANA with
this additional responsibility if there isn't a substantial risk. Was there
anything specific you had in mind?

Currently, the IANA considerations section of 
draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-07.txt describes how to define new "version" 
fields, but does not describe how to define new "base" fields.

Given that new base protocols may be identified, shouldn't there be a 
description on how IANA assigns new "base" values?

Hi,

Let's assume the following case (hopefully I understood you correctly):

You want to call 12345 on the PSTN side, and in the first INVITE you
only send the first digit, ie.

INVITE 1@pstnGW.com 

The GW returns 484, which you ACK.
Then you start sending digits with INFO, ie. 

INFO 1@pstnGW.com
more-digit: 23

The GW returns 200, and we may send more INFOs with the rest of the
digits.

Now:

1. How do we know when the call is established? Since we have sent a
final response to the INVITE, we can't send a 200 OK to it.

2. When all the digits have reached the PSTN network, there may be some
early media/alerting messages etc. to be sent, but again - since the GW
has sent a final response to the INVITE, 18x provisional responses can't
be sent.

What do you think about the following: Instead of sending 484, the GW
sends some provisional response (ie. 186 More digits needed). Then we
use INFO messages(s) to provide the rest of the digits, and when all
digits have reached the PSTN side, and the call can be established, we
receive the 200 OK to the INVITE.

[PTT]
No.  The GW NEVER sends 484 because as far as SIP is concerned, call routing
was successful if the call got as far as the GW.  Instead, a proxy returns
484.

> Then you start sending digits with INFO, ie. 
>

[PTT]
Assuming it was a proxy that returned the 484, instead I send another
initial INVITE:

  INVITE 123@pstnGW.com
> 
> The GW returns 200, and we may send more INFOs with the rest of the

[PTT]
Assume this time there were enough digits to route the call successfully to
a UAS at the GW.  It would return something like a 183 Session Progress to
provide a Contact and establish the call state machine.  The ingress GW
would send additional digits (and possibly encapsulated SAM messages) via
INFO.  The egress GW would start propagating the SAM messages once it had
enough digits to select next hop, but this process would be invisible to the
ingress GW.  The ACM would be sent back in a 180 or 183 interim response as
appropriate, and ANM would come back in the 200 OK.

All,

I sent some comments on this draft to the list in December. Below is an
update to these comments based on some off-line discussions. (The draft
itself is at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-privacy-00.txt)

Five enhancements to the draft are proposed:
1) to provide full support for European regulatory requirements (which are
doubtless duplicated in other markets) relating to Caller Identity
2) to include identity information relating to multiple types of party
involved in the session
3) to include multiple types of identity information about each party
4) to make privacy handling generic
5) to include location information

The basic object is to make Remote-Party-ID a general purpose header which
can be used for any type of identity information requiring standard privacy
and authenticity handling.

More details are below. If there is support for these kind of enhancements,
I will come up with a detailed proposal.

1) Regulatory requirements

It's required in some markets to make a distinction between identity
information which the user has explicitly requested be kept secret, and
identity information which cannot be released for some other reason (usually
Data Protection). It's proposed to add this distinction by having two
'witheld' indications, one for 'user witheld' and another for 'network
witheld'.

2)Types of Party

There are many types of party that could be involved in a call/session. We
should be capable of providing information about any/all of them and be
easily able to add more if required. Support for the following types is
suggested as a starting point:
i) Calling Party
ii) Called Party (whose terminal is alerting)
iii) Connected party (who answers the call)

Whilst these three types of party can be derived from the context (INVITE
implies (i), 1xx => (ii) and 2xx => (iii)), it would be valuable to include
an explicit indication of the party type so that new types can easily be
added in future.

For example, diversion services could use this header to indicate the
redirecting and redirecting-to parties thereby taking advantage of generic
privacy/authenticity handling (see (4) below). These other identity types
could be addressed in the appropriate I-D defining the diversion service.

3) Types of identity

A party involved in a session may have several kinds of identity. Support
should be provided for signalling any/all of them:

i) Subscriber identity - who owns the network subscription under which the
session is being established
ii) User identity - a human being
iii) Display/Alias identity - the identity that the party wishes to be known
as
iv) Return identity - the identity to be used to contact the party (e.g. to
establish a return call/session)
v) Terminal identity

In many practical scenarios one or all of these identities are in fact the
same and the same as the User identity, and so all do not need to be
signalled separately. In any given application scenario it should be
specified what these identities refer to.

4) Handling of privacy requirements

The above implies that the Remote-Party-ID header could be repeated to
specify multiple parties and multiple types of identity for each party.
Because of this the privacy handling should be on a per-Remote-Party-ID
basis - i.e. by tags in the header, not a separate Anonymity header.

Privacy handling can also be carried out by proxies without an understanding
of the party type or identity type. Basically, if the message is to be sent
to an 'untrusted' entity, private information is encrypted or removed. If it
is to be sent to a 'trusted' entity, the information is forwarded unchanged.

So, the header becomes a generic mechanism for any identity information with
privacy requirements. We can add new identity types as these become
necessary for new services, and get the privacy handling for free.

Similarly, authenticity handling can be made generic. Specifically, if
information is received from an untrusted source, the proxy marks it
'verified' or 'unverified' based on its own ability to verify the
information. If information is received from a trusted source, the
verification markings are left unchanged.

5) Location Information

A further type of Party information is the physical location of the Party.
This is useful for calls to emergency service centers and for geographic
routing services. There is apparantly a URL format for geographic location,
so this could be used for this purpose.

I agree with both of your statements.

In case (1), I do think it would be useful if the 484 message could indicate the
minimum number
of subsequent digits required, and perhaps the maximum, if the UAS knew such
things. This
would cut down the number of subsequent initial INVITEs.

In case (2), we need to specify the message that goes back to the ingress
gateway
indicating that SIP routing is complete so subsequent digits may be sent in INFO
messages.
I don't think this can be 200 OK as the call is not yet established, so a 1XX
response seems
the most appropriate.

This mechanism differs from that detailed in sip-isup-00.txt, but I do believe
it is more
appropriate.

K. Robinson

I see the disconnect here.  You are assuming that the first IAM gets
propagated through the egress gateway, so an ISUP state machine is set into
play.  I think the synthesis of our thinking is this:

(1) The first problem is to receive enough digits so an egress gateway can
be selected.  Until that happens, the digits have to be accumulated into
successive initial INVITE messages.

(2) Once an egress gateway has been selected, call routing is complete as
far as the SIP domain is concerned.  Hence it is legitimate to use the INFO
method to carry subsequent digits.

   The advantage to what you suggest above is that
   you cons up a UAS as necessary which still 
   preserves the e2e semantics. This still allows
   you to authenticate e2e which seems
   advantageous. While it doesn't mean that 
   the consed up UAS couldn't turn itself into
   a B2BUA and thus break the e2e semantics, 
   modeling initially as a B2BUA explicitly 
   encourages that which seems like a bad
   precedent to me.

I think there is a general consensus of opinion here (for case (2)); the
question
is what informational response to send back to the ingress when an egress has
been selected. The problem I have with 183 is that following the text in 7.2.3
of sip-isup-00.txt
would cause an ACM to be generated at the ingress which I don't think is what we
want o do
at this point.

K. Robinson

[PTT]
No.  The GW NEVER sends 484 because as far as SIP is concerned, call routing
was successful if the call got as far as the GW.  Instead, a proxy returns
484.

> Then you start sending digits with INFO, ie.
>

[PTT]
Assuming it was a proxy that returned the 484, instead I send another
initial INVITE:

  INVITE 123@pstnGW.com
>

[PTT]
Assume this time there were enough digits to route the call successfully to
a UAS at the GW.  It would return something like a 183 Session Progress to
provide a Contact and establish the call state machine.  The ingress GW
would send additional digits (and possibly encapsulated SAM messages) via
INFO.  The egress GW would start propagating the SAM messages once it had
enough digits to select next hop, but this process would be invisible to the
ingress GW.  The ACM would be sent back in a 180 or 183 interim response as
appropriate, and ANM would come back in the 200 OK.

Hi,

In this case I still think we could use another provisional response
(eg. 186, or whatever available...), which would not generate an ISUP
message, to inform the ingress GW that the call leg has been routed to
the egress GW, but that additional digits are needed.

Then, when all the digits are sent, and the call has reached its
destination on the PSTN side, 183 messages etc can be generated. I am
not sure a GW would generate 183 messages by itself anyway, unless it
"triggered" by an ISUP message, but 186 could be triggered by the GW.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg
Ericsson Finland

Mark Watson's update on the privacy draft discussions reminded me
that I had an action item to bring to the list, regarding multiple
180 responses in a SIP session.

When a SIP call is delivered to a PSTN gateway, and thus to a PSTN
endpoint (B), B may have call forwarding established to (C).  In some
cases (which I admit to not understanding completely) the SS7 signaling
could identify endpoint B as a destination that is ringing, and later
identify endpoint C as an updated destination that is ringing.
Presumably if C forwards to D, and D forwards to E, etc etc etc, there
could be a whole sequence of indications received by the PSTN gateway
about ringing endpoints.

The question is whether these {may/should/shouldnot} result in multiple 
180-Ringing SIP responses.  I don't see anything in 2543 or 2543bis
that limits a UAS to sending a single 180 response, but it doesn't
seem like expected behavior.  So, {should/must} a standard UAC handle 
multiple 180 responses?

Hi, Jon:

In addition, I have one more (indirect) question.

Your draft also refers to the ISUP to SIP Mapping I-D
(draft-ietf-sip-isup-00.txt). The call flows of this draft may also need to
be revisited with respect the call flows provided in the I-D
draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-02. It might be different issues, but may be
relevant later because a lot of unresolved issues mentioned in you draft may
also be addressed in the future.

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy

Jon,
I do not agree with your comments. I think ITU-T ISUP 2000 should be the
base,
as it is the base going forward. ITU-T ISUP 2000 is backwards compatible
with
previous versions such as ISUP '92. The options in ITU-T ISUP 2000 that
would
not need to be specified for this activity could be highlighted as not
mandatory.
The ANSI version of ISUP is T1.113 and has been updated to the ITU-T ISUP
2000 
level and is in the final stages for publication.

Subject: RE: [SIP] Question on "base" in draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-07.txt


I think it was the hope of the authors that all of the meaningful values for
'base' would be characterized in the document. Since 'base' reflects the
lowest common dominator (or, to coin a phrase, least specific ancestor)
variant of the ISUP version in question, the authors hoped that given the
backwards compatibility mechanism in ITU-T 1992 Q.76x, itu92 would be the
proper base for forthcoming ISUP versions (new versions of ANSI following
the 2000 issue support this mechanism, even).

That much said, if there are potential 'base' values which are of use to the
community that cannot be said to derive from itu92, the authors would
certainly like to be made aware of them. Is there anything out there that
the ISUP MIME draft misses?

In the face of serious concerns that useful new 'bases' might come to light
subsequent to the publication of an RFC, I suppose management of 'base' by
IANA could be introduced, but personally I'd rather not trouble IANA with
this additional responsibility if there isn't a substantial risk. Was there
anything specific you had in mind?

Currently, the IANA considerations section of 
draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-07.txt describes how to define new "version" 
fields, but does not describe how to define new "base" fields.

Given that new base protocols may be identified, shouldn't there be a 
description on how IANA assigns new "base" values?

A new response code would obviously be unambiguous, and may be necessary.
The problem doesn't arise in the tandem case, since you could have a rule
that ACM is sent back at the ingress side only when an encapsulated ACM is
received from the egress side.  The problem is to figure out appropriate
rules for generating ACM when the termination is to the SIP network.

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Hi,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; In this case I still think we could use another =
provisional response</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (eg. 186, or whatever available...), which =
would not generate an ISUP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; message, to inform the ingress GW that the call =
leg has been routed to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the egress GW, but that additional digits are =
needed.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Then, when all the digits are sent, and the =
call has reached its</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; destination on the PSTN side, 183 messages etc =
can be generated. I am</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; not sure a GW would generate 183 messages by =
itself anyway, unless it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;triggered&quot; by an ISUP message, but =
186 could be triggered by the GW.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;I think there is a general consensus of =
opinion here (for </FONT>

send back to the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ingress when an egress has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;been selected. The problem I have with 183 =
is that following </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the text in 7.2.3</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;of sip-isup-00.txt would cause an ACM to be =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I see the disconnect here.&nbsp; =
You are assuming that the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; first IAM gets</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;propagated through the egress =
gateway, so an ISUP state</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; machine is set</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into play.&nbsp; I think the =
synthesis of our thinking is this:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(1) The first problem is to =
receive enough digits so an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; egress gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can be selected.&nbsp; Until that =
happens, the digits have to be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;accumulated into successive =
initial INVITE messages.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(2) Once an egress gateway has =
been selected, call routing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; is complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as far as the SIP domain is =
concerned.&nbsp; Hence it is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; legitimate to use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the INFO method to carry =
subsequent digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let's assume the following case =
(hopefully I understood you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly):</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; You want to call 12345 on the PSTN =
side, and in the first </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INVITE you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; only send the first digit, ie.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; INVITE 1@pstnGW.com</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The GW returns 484, which you =
ACK.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; [PTT]</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; No.&nbsp; The GW NEVER sends 484 because =
as far as SIP is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; concerned, call routing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; was successful if the call got as far as =
the GW.&nbsp; Instead, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; a proxy returns</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 484.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you start sending digits with =
INFO, ie.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; INFO 1@pstnGW.com</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; more-digit: 23</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; [PTT]</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Assuming it was a proxy that returned the =
484, instead I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; send another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; initial INVITE:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; INVITE 123@pstnGW.com</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The GW returns 200, and we may send =
more INFOs with the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; rest of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; [PTT]</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Assume this time there were enough digits =
to route the call </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; successfully to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; a UAS at the GW.&nbsp; It would return =
something like a 183 </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Session Progress to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; provide a Contact and establish the call =
state machine.&nbsp; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The ingress GW</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; would send additional digits (and possibly =
encapsulated SAM </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; messages) via</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INFO.&nbsp; The egress GW would start =
propagating the SAM </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; messages once it had</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; enough digits to select next hop, but this =
process would be </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; invisible to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; ingress GW.&nbsp; The ACM would be sent =
back in a 180 or 183 </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; interim response as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; appropriate, and ANM would come back in =
the 200 OK.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. How do we know when the call is =
established? Since we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; have sent a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; final response to the INVITE, we =
can't send a 200 OK to it.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. When all the digits have reached =
the PSTN network, there</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; may be some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; early media/alerting messages etc. to =
be sent, but again -</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; since the GW</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; has sent a final response to the =
INVITE, 18x provisional</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; responses can't</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; be sent.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think about the =
following: Instead of sending </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 484, the GW</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; sends some provisional response (ie. =
186 More digits </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; needed). Then we</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; use INFO messages(s) to provide the =
rest of the digits, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and when all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; digits have reached the PSTN side, =
and the call can be </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; established, we</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; receive the 200 OK to the =
INVITE.</FONT>

In the scenario described, the PSTN returns an ACM message when the call
originally terminates at (B). If (B) has Call Forwarding on No Reply (say),
then when the No Reply timer expires, a CPG (Call Progress) will be returned
indicating that diversion is taking place.

Subsequent diversions will cause further CPG messages.

It would be desireably to map these to 1xx responses in the SIP network, as
they can provide the caller with information as to where the call has been
forwarded.

It doesn't really matter which version of ITU-T ISUP we reference - because
after 1992 they are all backwards compatible with each other.

The point was that there only needs to be a single 'base' value for
post-1992 ITU-T ISUPs. As soon as the ISUP processor sees this, it knows
that it can handle unrecognised information according to the compatibility
procedure and so can sucessfully process the message.

Given this, ISUP 1992 was chosen because it was the first version with the
compatibility mechanism. It would be arbitrary to choose another version -
why not 1997 or 2004 ??

The intent of this 'base' value is to imply that the encapsulated signalling
is based on an ITU-T ISUP version 1992 or later, so it covers ISUP 2000.

Regards,

Mark Watson

Mark,
My concern is the ability to handle the new ISUP messages and parameters.
Insure that these do not end up as unrecognized
messages and parameters. Also there is a need for the new application
transport message (APM) and new application
transport parameter (APP) supporting APM. It is not arbitrary to select
ITU-T ISUP 2000 as it is the last significant version.Having the 'base'
value to encapsulated signalling based on ITU-T ISUP 2000, also covers ISUP
92, from a compatibility point of view.

It doesn't really matter which version of ITU-T ISUP we reference - because
after 1992 they are all backwards compatible with each other.

The point was that there only needs to be a single 'base' value for
post-1992 ITU-T ISUPs. As soon as the ISUP processor sees this, it knows
that it can handle unrecognised information according to the compatibility
procedure and so can sucessfully process the message.

Given this, ISUP 1992 was chosen because it was the first version with the
compatibility mechanism. It would be arbitrary to choose another version -
why not 1997 or 2004 ??

The intent of this 'base' value is to imply that the encapsulated signalling
is based on an ITU-T ISUP version 1992 or later, so it covers ISUP 2000.

Regards, 

Mark Watson

I've had another thought.  If the UAS returns Accept-Content:
application/isup, it could be a signal to the ingress gateway to hold its
ACM until it receives one encapsulated from the egress gateway.  In the
absence of that signal, the ingress gateway would assume that call routing
was complete upon receipt of the first 1xx response.

A new response code would obviously be unambiguous, and may be necessary.
The problem doesn't arise in the tandem case, since you could have a rule
that ACM is sent back at the ingress side only when an encapsulated ACM is
received from the egress side.  The problem is to figure out appropriate
rules for generating ACM when the termination is to the SIP network.

  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; ingress when an egress has</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt;been selected. The problem I have with 183 is that following 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; the text in 7.2.3</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt;of sip-isup-00.txt would cause an ACM to be generated at the 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; ingress which I don't think is what we</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt;want o do at this point.</FONT> <BR><FONT

  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I see the disconnect 
  here.&nbsp; You are assuming that the </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; first IAM 
  gets</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;propagated through the egress 
  gateway, so an ISUP state</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; machine is 
  set</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into play.&nbsp; I think the 
  synthesis of our thinking is this:</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(1) The first problem is to 
  receive enough digits so an</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; egress 
  gateway</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can be selected.&nbsp; 
  Until that happens, the digits have to be</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt;accumulated into successive initial INVITE messages.</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(2) Once 
  an egress gateway has been selected, call routing</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; is complete</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as far as the 
  SIP domain is concerned.&nbsp; Hence it is </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  legitimate to use</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the INFO method 
  to carry subsequent digits.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let's assume the following case (hopefully I 
  understood you</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly):</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; You 
  want to call 12345 on the PSTN side, and in the first </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; INVITE you</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; only send the 
  first digit, ie.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; INVITE 1@pstnGW.com</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The GW returns 484, which you 
  ACK.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  [PTT]</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; No.&nbsp; The GW NEVER sends 484 
  because as far as SIP is </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; concerned, call 
  routing</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; was successful if the call got as 
  far as the GW.&nbsp; Instead, </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; a proxy 
  returns</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 484.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you start sending digits with 
  INFO, ie.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; INFO 1@pstnGW.com</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; more-digit: 
  23</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  [PTT]</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; Assuming it was a proxy that returned 
  the 484, instead I </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; send another</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; initial INVITE:</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; INVITE 123@pstnGW.com</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The GW 
  returns 200, and we may send more INFOs with the </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  rest of the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; digits.</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; [PTT]</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; Assume this time there were enough digits to route the call 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; successfully to</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  a UAS at the GW.&nbsp; It would return something like a 183 </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; Session Progress to</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; provide a 
  Contact and establish the call state machine.&nbsp; </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; The ingress GW</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; would send 
  additional digits (and possibly encapsulated SAM </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  messages) via</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; INFO.&nbsp; The egress GW 
  would start propagating the SAM </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; messages once it 
  had</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; enough digits to select next hop, but 
  this process would be </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; invisible to the</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; ingress GW.&nbsp; The ACM would be sent back in a 
  180 or 183 </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; interim response as</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; appropriate, and ANM would come back in the 200 OK.</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now:</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. How do we know when the call is 
  established? Since we </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; have sent a</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; final response to the INVITE, we can't send a 
  200 OK to it.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. When all the digits have reached the PSTN network, 
  there</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; may be some</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; early media/alerting messages etc. to be sent, but again 
  -</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; since the GW</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; has sent a final response to the INVITE, 18x 
  provisional</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; responses can't</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; be sent.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think about the 
  following: Instead of sending </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 484, the GW</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; sends some provisional response (ie. 186 More 
  digits </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; needed). Then we</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; use INFO messages(s) to provide the rest of the digits, 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; and when all</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; digits have reached the PSTN side, and the call can be </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; established, we</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; receive the 
  200 OK to the INVITE.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT

In San Diego, third party call control was brought up again as an issue
with the manyfolks draft.  I believe it is covered by the draft as it 
exists today, and offer the following call flow to demonstrate this.

A is attempting to call B.  Proxy in the middle, CC, decides that
a transcoder, T, is needed in the call.  Resulting call is A<->T
and T<->B, with CC being the 3rd party controller of T<->B.
T is assumed to not need to ring, and it will respond immediately
with a 200-OK when the INVITE preconditions are satisfied.

In all cases below, item n+1 in a grouping is enabled by item n.
Where independent sequences start, a note indicates where the first
item in the group overlaps with the previous.

There is no question that this call flow is complex, and has lots
of messages with the third party call controller.  However, it
has the very nice property that each endpoint follows exactly the
same resource reservation procedures whether there is a 3pcc involved
or not.  All of the special handling is done by CC.

1. A --INVITE-> CC				   a=qos: required sendrecv
2.		CC ---INVITE--> T		   a=qos: required sr confirm
3.		CC <----183---- T		   a=qos: required sr confirm
4. A <---183--- CC
5. A ====RSVP=================> T
6. A --COMET--> CC				   a=qos: success send
		note that CC used a Record-Route in the 183 to force the
		PRACK and COMET to go through CC.  This is independent of
		the use of a Record-Route in the 200-OK for future signaling.

(also in response to the 183 message (4) above)
5. A --PRACK--> CC ---PRACK---> T
6. A <===RSVP================== T
7.		CC <--COMET---- T		   a=qos: success send
	note that T is now stalled, waiting for CC
		to send a COMET to T.

(also in response to the INVITE message (1) above)
2.		CC ---INVITE--> T		   w/o SDP
3.		CC <----183---- T		   a=qos: required sr confirm
4.		CC -----------------INVITE----> B  a=qos: required sr confirm
5.		CC <------------------183------ B  a=qos: required sr confirm
6.		CC ------------------PRACK----> B
7.				T <===RSVP===== B
8.		CC <----COMET------------------ B  a=qos: success send
	note that B is now stalled, waiting for CC to send a COMET to B

(also in response to the 183 message (3) immediately above)
4.		CC ---PRACK---> T		   a=qos: required sr confirm
5.		CC		T ====RSVP====> B
6.		CC <--COMET---- T		   a=qos: success send

At this point, CC knows that resources are available from A->T, from T->A,
from T->B, and B->T.  It is "safe" to let the call proceed.

7.		CC ---COMET-------------------> B  a=qos: success send
8.		CC <---180--------------------- B
(CC generates a 180 response for the A<->T call, knowing that T doesn't ring)
9. A <---180--- CC
10		CC <---200--------------------- B
11		CC ---COMET---> T		   a=qos: success send
12		CC <---200----- T
13 A <---200--- CC			completes call from A<->T
(also in response to the 200-OK from B, received in (10) above)
11		CC ----200----> T	completes call from T<->B

This could be accomodated by having ISUP 2000 registered as a -version- with
IANA, but using itu92 as a -base-. This has come up a couple of times now.
Clearly, the most compatible ISUP variant characterization should appear in
the base string, and version characterizations that identify additional
features/options above and beyond the base should be identified in the
version string. Entities that recognize the version will preserve all of the
features present in ISUP 2000. I don't see why that can't work for your
case. Is the version/base distinction in the draft unclear on these sorts of
points?

Also please do note that WG last call for this document ended some weeks ago
now.

Mark,
My concern is the ability to handle the new ISUP messages and parameters.
Insure that these do not end up as unrecognized
messages and parameters. Also there is a need for the new application
transport message (APM) and new application
transport parameter (APP) supporting APM. It is not arbitrary to select
ITU-T ISUP 2000 as it is the last significant version.Having the 'base'
value to encapsulated signalling based on ITU-T ISUP 2000, also covers ISUP
92, from a compatibility point of view.

Subject: RE: [SIP] Question on "base" in draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-07.txt



It doesn't really matter which version of ITU-T ISUP we reference - because
after 1992 they are all backwards compatible with each other.

The point was that there only needs to be a single 'base' value for
post-1992 ITU-T ISUPs. As soon as the ISUP processor sees this, it knows
that it can handle unrecognised information according to the compatibility
procedure and so can sucessfully process the message.

Given this, ISUP 1992 was chosen because it was the first version with the
compatibility mechanism. It would be arbitrary to choose another version -
why not 1997 or 2004 ??

The intent of this 'base' value is to imply that the encapsulated signalling
is based on an ITU-T ISUP version 1992 or later, so it covers ISUP 2000.

A few questions on this:

1)  Does this cover BICC (Q.1901)?
2) Does it cover forward compatibility?
3) The current bases cover ITU, USA, ETSI and Japan.  What about the rest 
of the world?
4) What about countries that use TUP or some other non-ISUP, SS7 signaling 
(e.g., NUP)?

I don't really think everything needs to be defined today, but what is the 
extension procedure when a new base needs to be defined?  Or is it just 
hacked into a new version registered in IANA.  For examle:
         Content-Type: application/ISUP; version=q1901;
                          base=itu-t92+

I guess after all, base is optional so I'm not sure it matters if it is 
done this way.

I would argue that the 'base' parameter exists pretty much to cater to the
compatibility mechanism present in ITU-T 92 (which is in essence a forward
compatibility mechanism from the perspective of that issue). If other ISUP
variants unrelated to itu92 have independent compatibility mechanisms, then
this is perhaps something we should consider, but I don't think the authors
of the draft are aware of any. As you point out, 'base' is optional - I
believe that outside of strongly ITU-grounded networks, it will not see
substantial use.

And is it just me, or is the idea that BICC will be encapsulated in SIP
somewhat counterintuitive? Are there any services today that require that?
Anyway, if there is interest I'd be inclined to say that BICC should have
it's own MIME type which should be discussed on its own merits.

Hi Henning & Kundan,

I have a query with regards to draft-singh-sip-h323-01.txt.

The draft states that the destination information from the H.323 call be
derived from the To URL in a new INVITE (see A.1.2). It seems that the
request-URI is ignored entirely (despite the fact that some of the call
flows are annotated with "INVITE sip:kns10@cs.columbia.edu").

I do not see how this will work when a SIP UA or proxy redirects (or proxies
with updating the request) call to a H.323 device. 

For example: 

INVITE sip:rfairlie@nuera.com SIP/2.0
To: "Robert Fairlie-Cuninghame" <sip:rfairlie@nuera.com>

is sent to the proxy at nuera.com which responds with a SIP/2.0 302 Temp
Moved
Contact: <sip:1000@h323-gatekeeper.nuera.com;maddr=h323-iwf.nuera.com>

How will this work if the IWF ignores the Request-URI ?

If the IWF instead uses the request URI in the H323 SETUP destinationInfo,
is there anythign wrong with it using the display name from the To? Unless a
380 Alternate Service is issued then the display name should still be
correct.

On a related note in the base SIP spec, if a 380 Alternate Service is issued
(which requires user interaction), the spec needs to be clarified whether
the new call attempt will use a new call-leg with the To field changed
apprpriately.

Cheers,

Robert.

Just to clarify, we still need the Anonymity header for the IP-address
privacy case.

Hi,

I see a couple of issues here.

1. Even if the UAS returns Accept-Encoding: application/isup, it doesn't
mean that it is going to send an encapsulated ACM.

2. Even if it the UAS GW would send an encapsulated ACM, it is not sure
that the UAC GW supports ISUP transparency in the first place. It may
support only ISUP/SIP mapping, for example.

I think that part of the problem, which is not related only to overlap
dialling, is that a SIP/PSTN GW from a SIP point of view is an SIP UA,
and from a SIP point of view should act like an SIP UA. Maybe it should
be considered as a SIP node of its own, with GW specific functional
requirements. The only thing we have now is how to map between ISUP and
SIP, but that is obviously not enough. ???

Hi,

This has probably been discussed before, but I will give my comment
anyway.

If a UAC only wants to know the time between a request and a response
(provisional or final, depending on what the UAC wants to know) I see no
reason to add a header which only has to be echoed. Instead, the UAC
could save the request-sent-time together with the rest of the
transaction data, and then calculate the time when the response is
received.

And, if any other node, for some reason, really needs the time, it could
send an "Extension required" response. Of course, the UAC could choose
to always include the Timestamp header in every request, but it
shouldn't be mandatory to echo it.

From a SIP standard point of view this is not a big issue, but I am only
trying to keep the network packages as small as possible :)

The timestamp header is needed to distinguish between retransmissions of
the same request, which will otherwise look identical. Determining the
round-trip and the ACK ambiguity is a classical TCP problem.

Agreed, and that is a nasty point.  It's related to the next one.

[PTT]
That one is easily solved, in two ways.  First, by hypothesis the UAC GW has
encapsulated the IAM in the initial INVITE.  It can also include an
Accept-Content: header.  In fact, this is essential so that the two ends can
negotiate stuff like ISUP version or the fact that one of them really wants
to propagate Q.931.

So, given that the UAS GW has received an encapsulated IAM, the
Accept-Content: header indicates that it did or did not find the
encapsulated content acceptable.  If it did find it acceptable, how do we
oblige it to keep up its end of the conversation?  I expect the behaviour
has to be specified in the SIP-T umbrella document, and SIP/GSTN gateway
products have to indicate their conformity to that document.

So, SIP-T is used for, among other things, ISUP-SIP-ISUP.
You don't think anyone wants to do BICC-SIP-BICC when SIP is one operator's
network, and the BICCs are two other operators?

I also see BICC-SIP-ISUP and of course ISUP-BICC-SIP-ISUP and variations.

Hi,

The draft below has been submitted and is now available online. It discusses
the use of SIP in small adhoc and Pico networks.

The intention is not to imply that using SIP for session control in these
type of networks is necessarily a use of SIP that leverages the strengths of
the protocol, rather to recognize that there may be SIP based applications
that a user wants to use in the usual way  between locally available clients
without any changes to his application while attached to such networks.

Comments or feedback would be welcome.

Cheers,

Mick O'Doherty

	Title		: Pico SIP
	Author(s)	: M. O'Doherty
	Filename	: draft-odoherty-pico-sip-00.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 30-Jan-01
	
This document defines an extension to the SIP protocol to allow 
it be used in adhoc networks or Pico Networks. It leverages the 
direct, client to client session initiation capabilities of SIP, 
although there may be applications where the redirect and 
proxying abilities will be important also. Note the intention is 
not to imply that SIP is inherently the best protocol for such 
networks, but to recognize that there will likely be many SIP 
based applications in existence and that it would be good to 
allow these applications work with as little change as possible 
in this different type of network.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

This is an error. The signaling gateway should use
the Request-URI instead of To: URL. This occurs at more than
one place in the draft.

We will correct this in the next version.

Interesting idea. I would think that REGISTER, in peer-to-peer mode
effectively, would fit pretty well. In a sense, every piconet member is
a registrar.

hi,

We do not want have a database. We do not want to implement Register
messages.
How can I location?

For example, a message from our company out to sip:bob@lucent.com , how can
I get the IP address of bob@lucent.com , some articles say use DNS. But I do
not know how to implement this with DNS. I have no experience about this.
Please help!!!


Best wishes!
Yours sincerely, Robert Chen

Michael, would you assume each Piconet member in the same subnet (broadcast
domain), can we define a well defined multicast address to get the listing of
the users with SIP UA enabled in the neighborhood, and their contact address,
may be by using something  like SAP/SDP.

Thanks
Ashutosh

There are no restrictions on any 1xx responses, in terms of number,
ordering and type. Thus, any combination and sequence of 1xx has to be
handled correctly, including several 1xx with the same status code. The
spec says:

A server {\MAY} issue zero
or more 1xx responses, with no restriction on their ordering or
uniqueness.

Here is REFER using NOTIFYs from implicit Subscriptions
to get around the transaction timeout problem. I've submitted
this to the draft repository, but wanted to get it into
the hands of those attending next week's meeting as early
as I could.

Internet-Draft        SIP Call Control - Transfer          February =
2001=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
1. Overview=0A=
=0A=
   This document defines a SIP[1] extension and details its use to=0A=
   provide Call Transfer capabilities. This is part of a family of =
Call=0A=
   Control extensions described in the Call Control Framework[2]=0A=
   document. =0A=
=0A=
   The mechanisms discussed here are most closely related to=0A=
   traditional unattended and consultation hold transfers. =
Discussion=0A=
   of attended transfer (where all parties are briefly in a =
conference)=0A=
   is deferred until the conferencing features in this framework are=0A=
   addressed. =0A=
=0A=
   This work has roots in draft-ietf-sip-cc-01[4] but some basic=0A=
   semantics are different. In particular, transfers are achieved=0A=
   through a new method that does not terminate the original =
signaling=0A=
   relationship. By disassociating transfers from the processing of=0A=
   BYE, these changes facilitate recovery of failed transfers and=0A=
   clarify state management in the participating entities. =0A=
=0A=
2. Changes from draft-sparks-sip-cc-transfer-02=0A=
   o  Changed the REFER response to be immediate instead of waiting =
for=0A=
      the referred action to complete=0A=
   o  Added use of NOTIFY to deliver the result of the referred =
action=0A=
   o  Removed the claim of easy migration from BYE/ALSO=0A=
=0A=
3. The REFER Method=0A=
=0A=
   REFER is a SIP method as defined by RFC2543[1]. The REFER method=0A=
   indicates that the recipient should contact a third party using =
the=0A=
   contact information provided in the method. A success response=0A=
   indicates that the recipient was able to contact the third party.=0A=
   The REFER method follows the session's current signaling path. In=0A=
   particular, the Request-URI of the REFER method identifies the=0A=
   recipient. =0A=
=0A=
   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol for emitting and responding =
to=0A=
   a REFER request are identical to those for a BYE request in [1]. =
The=0A=
   behavior of SIP entities not implementing the REFER (or any other=0A=
   unknown) method is explicitly defined in [1] and is not discussed=0A=
   further here. =0A=
=0A=
3.1 The Refer-To Header=0A=
=0A=
   Refer-To is a request-header as defined by [1]. It may only =
appear=0A=
   in a REFER request. =0A=
=0A=
      Refer-To =3D ("Refer-To" | "r") ":" URL =0A=

3.2 The Referred-By Header=0A=
=0A=
   Referred-By is a request-header as defined by [1]. It can appear =
in=0A=
   any request. It conveys the identity of the original REFERrer to =
the=0A=
   referred-to party, optionally proving the identity and that the=0A=
   REFERrer actually issued this reference. =0A=
=0A=
=0A=
        Referred-By      =3D ("Referred-By" | "b") ":" referrer-url =
";"=0A=

        sig-scheme-parms =3D token "=3D" ( token | quoted-string )=0A=
=0A=
   The referrer-url contains the SIP URL of the party sending the =
REFER=0A=
   request. The referenced-url contains a copy of the URL placed in =
the=0A=
   Refer-To: header. Any occurrences of < or > in the referenced-url=0A=
   MUST be escaped. The ref-signature contains a signature over the=0A=
   concatenation of referrer-url and referenced-url.  An example=0A=
   signature scheme is given in section 3.1.2. =0A=
=0A=
   A REFER request MUST contain exactly one Referred-By header. =0A=

=0A=
   Editor's note - The previous version of this draft required the=0A=
   agent responding to REFER to wait until the referred action=0A=
   completed before sending a final response to the REFER. That =

3.6.1 Accessing the referred-to resource=0A=
=0A=
   A UA receiving a well-formed REFER request SHOULD request =
approval=0A=
   from the user to proceed (this request could be interactive or=0A=
   through configuration). Upon receiving approval from the user, =
the=0A=
   UA MUST contact the resource identified by the URL in the =
Refer-To:=0A=
   header. Note that if the URL is a SIP URL, it could contain =
header=0A=
   fields such as Call-Id that will be used to form the resulting=0A=
   request. If the URL is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the=0A=
   REFER request should be copied into the request sent to the=0A=

3.6.2 Reporting on the results of the reference=0A=
=0A=
   Once it is known whether the reference succeeded or failed, the =
UA=0A=
   receiving the REFER SHOULD notify the agent sending the refer =
using=0A=
   the NOTIFY mechanism defined in Event Notification in SIP[3] as =
if=0A=
   the the REFER had established a subscription. In particular: =0A=
=0A=
   o  The NOTIFY should reflect the To:, From:, and Call-ID headers=0A=
      from the REFER as if they had arrived in a SUBSCRIBE. =0A=
=0A=
   o  If the reference succeeded, the NOTIFY MUST contain Event:=0A=
      refersuccess =0A=
=0A=
   o  If the reference failed for any reason, or was not attempted=0A=
      after being accepted, the NOTIFY MUST contain Event: referfailure =
=0A=
=0A=
   o  The notifying UA SHOULD send exactly one NOTIFY with an event=0A=
      from the profile {refersuccess,referfailure}. If multiple=0A=
      notifications are sent, perhaps including events from other=0A=
      extension drafts, the UA MUST NOT send both refersuccess and=0A=
      referfailure events. =0A=
=0A=
   o  Analogous to the case for SUBSCRIBE described in [3], the =
agent=0A=
      that issued the REFER MUST be prepared to receive a NOTIFY =
before=0A=
      the REFER transaction completes. =0A=

3.10 Security Considerations=0A=
=0A=
   The security requirements of [1] apply to the REFER method. =0A=
=0A=
   This mechanism relies on providing contact information for the=0A=
   referred-to resource to the party being referred. Care should be=0A=
   taken to provide a suitably restricted URI if the referred to=0A=
   resource should be protected. =0A=
=0A=
   Care should be taken when implementing the logic that determines=0A=
   whether or not to accept the REFER request. A UA not capable of=0A=
   accessing non-SIP URLs SHOULD NOT accept REFER requests to them. =0A=

   of the following roles: =0A=
=0A=

        Originator -  wishes to place a call to the Recipient. This =

                      the Recipient.=0A=
=0A=

        Recipient -   the party the Originator is ultimately connected =
to.=0A=
=0A=
4.2 Requirements=0A=
   1.  Any party in a SIP session MUST be able to transfer any other=0A=
       party in that session at any point in that session.=0A=
   2.  The Transferor and the Transferee MUST NOT be removed from a=0A=
       session as part of a transfer transaction.=0A=
=0A=
             At first glance, requirement 2 may seem to indicate=0A=
             that the user experience in a transfer must be=0A=
             significantly different from what a current PBX or=0A=
             Centrex user expects. As the call-flows in this=0A=
             document show, this is not the case. A client MAY=0A=
             preserve the current experience. In fact, without=0A=
             this requirement, some forms of the current=0A=
             experience (ringback on unattended transfer failure=0A=
             for instance) will be lost.=0A=
=0A=
   3.  The Transferor MUST know whether or not the transfer was=0A=
       successful (this is significantly different from the=0A=
       requirements of draft-ietf-sip-cc-01).=0A=
=0A=
4.3 Using REFER to achieve Call Transfer=0A=
=0A=
   A REFER can be issued by the Transferor to cause the Transferee =
to=0A=
   issue an INVITE to the Transfer-Target. Note that a successful =
REFER=0A=
   transaction does not terminate the session between the Transferor=0A=
   and the Transferee. If those parties wish to terminate their=0A=
   session, they must do so with a subsequent BYE request. The media=0A=
   negotiated between the transferee and the transfer target is not=0A=
   affected by the media that had been negotiated between the=0A=
   transferor and the transferee. In particular, the INVITE issued =
by=0A=
   the Transferee will have the same SDP body it would have if he=0A=
   Transferee had initiated that INVITE on its own. Further, the=0A=

=0A=
   disposition of the media streams between the Transferor and the=0A=
   Transferee is not altered by the REFER method. Agents may alter a=0A=
   session's media through additional signaling. For example, they =
may=0A=
   make use of the SIP hold re-INVITE [1] or the conferencing=0A=
   extensions provided by this framework. =0A=
=0A=
4.4 Unattended Transfer=0A=
=0A=
   Unattended Transfer consists of the Transferor providing the=0A=
   Transfer Target's contact to the Transferee. The Transferee =
attempts=0A=
   to establish a session using that contact and reports the results =
of=0A=
   that attempt to the Transferor. The signaling relationship =
between=0A=
   the Transferor and Transferee is not terminated, so the call is=0A=
   recoverable if the Transfer Target cannot be reached. Note that =
the=0A=
   Transfer Target's contact information has been exposed to the=0A=
   Transferee. The provided contact can be used to make new calls in=0A=
   the future. The diagrams below show indicate the first line of =
each=0A=
   message. All messages in a particular diagram share the same=0A=
   Call-ID. In these diagrams, media is managed through reINVITE =
holds,=0A=
   but other mechanisms (mixing multiple media streams at the UA or=0A=
   using the conferencing extensions for example) are valid. =0A=

4.5.3 Consultation Hold in the presence of forking proxies=0A=

   It is worth noting that the examples given above abstract away =
any=0A=
   proxies that might be between the three parties. In 4.5.1 for=0A=
   example, the URL used to reach the Transfer Target may go through =
a=0A=
   forking proxy. There is no guarantee that the Transferee's and=0A=
   Transferor's invitations to the Transfer Target will reach the =
same=0A=
   endpoint. If the proxy forked in parallel, both invitations could=0A=
   cause multiple endpoints to ring. To increase the probability of =
the=0A=
   desired behavior of having the referred invite reach and ring =
only=0A=
   the same endpoint as the consultation invite, the Transferor =

=0A=
5.1 200 vs 202=0A=
=0A=
   Should an agent accepting a NOTIFY request return a 200 OK or a =
202=0A=
   Accepted? =0A=
=0A=
5.2 Should REFER expire?=0A=
=0A=
   Since REFER is effectively establishing a Subscription per [3],=0A=
   should the REFER request be required to contain an Expires: =
header?=0A=
   This would allow REFERer to specify how long he's willing to wait=0A=
   for the reference to complete. If the referred action exceeds =
that=0A=
   time, the agent processing the refer could return referfailure, =
stop=0A=
   trying, and free the state it needed for that processing. Without=0A=
   this or a similar mechanism, both agents involved in a REFER=0A=
   transaction could be forced to hold state indefinitely. =0A=
=0A=
5.3 REFER is now dependent on sip-events=0A=
=0A=
   By introducing NOTIFY, this work is prevented from moving to RFC=0A=
   until the sip-events draft moves to that level (that work is=0A=
   currently an individual submission). What needs to happen to our=0A=

hi,

I want to ask this question again. How can the SIP proxy server get the next
proxy server(hpo)? DNS can only get those SIP servers like, sip.domain.com
If a sip server address like this, sip:siphappens.com, DNS can not get the
address!
So how can the my SIP proxy server get the next hop?
This question may seems easy for your expert, but I really need your help.
Thanks.

Best wishes!
Yours sincerely, Robert Chen

Hi Kundan,

Do you see any problems with forming the destination h323-id with the
display name from the To: and the SIP URL from the Request-URL?

Robert.

Where is the URL format specified?

I agree that URL is a good place to accomodate geographical location and it
would be useful to have a standardized notation. draft-daviel-http-geo-header-02.txt
specifies header fields for conveying location in HTTP. However as the position 
identifies services and may be used with more protocols than just HTTP I would 
prefer conveying it in URLs.

Henning's 911 draft also addresses many of related issues. 

Is there interest in going ahead with such URLs?

Jiri



------------
P.S. It seems to me there are some geo-service points on which some folks 
like to disagree. Let me give a couple of more details from my perspective 
so that we can save a couple of RTTs if there is interest in discussing this.
- URL format for conveying geo-info is a URL format and nothing else. There 
  are three orthogonal jobs: 1) determining geo-info, 2) finding a server 
  providing location-base services and 3) conveying the geo-info to it. 
  Geo-info in URLs would make only the third job. 
- The geo-info may be gained from anywhere: access providers, from GPS provider, 
  typed-in by sextant-equipped user, from IPv6 address, etc. It does not have to 
  indicate your current position; for example, when planning a trip a travelling 
  agent may want to get connected to a hotel nearby his client's destination.
- Both end-devices and proxies (if they know it) may insert geo-info. The latter
  case may be subject to privacy issues -- users may not be always happy to 
  disseminate geo-info.  
- No limitations are put on how to find location-based services. They may be
  located at an outbound proxy discovered automatically using DHCP but they
  may be at Jeff's pizza server advertised in newspaper as well.
- No assumptions are made about what the services are; it is service providers'
  discretion to implement "conntact a Pizza Inc. rep in caller's proximity", 
  "notify my parents whenever I move", "emergency", etc.

To start with, a couple of small oversights in the document.

Call flow 4.5.2 : Protects transfer target.

1/ I would think that the 200 level response for REFER issued by Transfer
Target should read 200 OK (it says 200 trying).

2/ The response for NOTIFY (refersuccess) should go to the transfer target
and not to the transferee.

I had some questions for which some clarifications would help.

Section 4.2 Requirements:

I think the statement saying "the draft preserves current transfer
experience" is not totally true. I do see that end user experiences are
indeed quite different in the two cases 

First of all, todays transfer don't request the transferee if it should
proceed with a transfer request(although the doc says that one might
over-ride this with configuration). 

Two, as regards billing (I am sure that this statement is going to cause
people to beat me up, but nevertheless here I go :-)), the transferee ends
up paying for the transferred call leg, quite untrue in the current PSTN
world.......

Three, based on the type of transfer (protect target, exposes target) et al,
call flows/messages exchanged are totally different, so I would imagine that
an UA would have to prompt the end user what type of transfer he/she intends
to perform, protect transfer target, expose transfer target et al, unless an
UA is hardcoded to perform only one type of transfer "all" the time(which is
again different in current transfer call scenarios where a user can perform
any type of transfer that he/she desires to, and may be convert that to a
conference later).

So also, in the call flow where the transfer target's number is not
protected, the transfer target first gets a call from the transferor, he/she
has to hang up and then a answer a new call from the transferree to get
connected, not quite the way current PSTN transfers work. I don't know how
an UA "may" preserve the end user experience here? 

So, based on all of these, I think we should remove the paragraph which says
"call flows preserve current end user experience" ! 

Finally, I wouldn't know how one would implement the the same, if gateways
that spoke SIP on one end, and provided analog end points on the other were
on the transferee side of the call(or on the transfer target side in case
where the transfer target was to be protected). Meaning, would gateways be
able to preserve end user experience? Manage multiple sessions, speech
paths, et al for a single call? Think Rohan said he knows of one that does
it :-), but just getting a re-assurance from others on this list as well....

Just my two cents.

Here is a very terse set of of requirements for
a configuration framework.  This intended to
help us move towards a standard way SIP
user agents can be configured automatically
and updated on demand.

I have submitted this draft, but I wanted to get
it asap to people for consideration or discussion
as part of the configuration topic on the
agenda at next week's interim meeting.
Cheers,
Dan

Have a problem with the strict requirements that for secure and confidential
business conferences, the identity of all authenticated participants should
be clearly be known and preferably displayed at all times during the
conference.

However, the I-D on "Models for Multi-Party Conferencing in SIP" states:
>4.5 Discovering Participant Identities
>   The identities of other participants in the conference are
>   NOT known through SIP.

Using RTP to display user identities seems broken, since an unwanted
listener can have no RTP packets sent.
http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-conferencing-models-00.t
xt

Any other solution to display all participants?
How could a conference bridge signal to users who else in participating?

Thanks, Henry

SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY may be an appropriate mechanism. However, nothing
prevents a participant from having others listening in, so this isn't a
foolproof mechanism.

Kundan,

There also seems to be other discrepancies in the H.323 - SIP address
conversion. For instance, Section 6.1.2 says that if a tel url contains "w"
then it cannot be converted into an e164-id alias address. The draft however
makes no mention of the digits A, B, C & D which are allowed in tel URL's
but not allowed in e164-id (according to the draft). What is the correct
action here?

In the same section, the visual separators "(" & ")" should be mentioned for
completeness.

The draft also makes no mention with regards to the "+" character when
converting a e164-id to a SIP URL (or tel: URL). Is this an intentional
omission? 

I also wished to point out that acoording to
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-singh-sip-h323-01.txt has expired
(and hence is unavilable).

Robert.

SS7 identifies B as ringing and then forwards the call to C in the case
of call forwarding on no answer. A calls B. B rings several times but does
not answer the call. Then the call is forwarded to C. This is a common way
to implement a voice mailbox. You forward your call on no-answer to your
voice mail.

In the absence of receiving an encapsulated ACM, the ingress
gateway could generate its own ACM when it receives a 180 Alerting; this
response must mean it is safe to assume call routing is complete
and caters for terminations within a SIP network. Thought needs to be
given to scenarios where a non-200 final response is received, say 486
Busy, as in these cases 180 Alerting, probably, wouldn't be generated.

Regards,

Keith.

[PTT]
Agreed, and that is a nasty point.  It's related to the next one.

[PTT]
That one is easily solved, in two ways.  First, by hypothesis the UAC GW has
encapsulated the IAM in the initial INVITE.  It can also include an
Accept-Content: header.  In fact, this is essential so that the two ends can
negotiate stuff like ISUP version or the fact that one of them really wants
to propagate Q.931.

So, given that the UAS GW has received an encapsulated IAM, the
Accept-Content: header indicates that it did or did not find the
encapsulated content acceptable.  If it did find it acceptable, how do we
oblige it to keep up its end of the conversation?  I expect the behaviour
has to be specified in the SIP-T umbrella document, and SIP/GSTN gateway
products have to indicate their conformity to that document.

Hi,

I am having few questions.....
I am sorry if these questions have been asked already.

    1. From rfc2543bis-02, section 4.2.3,
       "A server SHOULD return Allow, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-
       Language and Supported header fields. The response MAY contain a
       message body indicating the capabilities of the end system(rather
       than properties of any existing call)."

       My question is, Is there any provision to request for particular
       field, like Allow or just message body, using OPTION request. I
       could not locate this type of features in rfc2543bis-02.

    2. Is there any example where message body will be used with BYE
       request/responce.

    3. From section
       " Not all of the SIP request or response can be encrypted end-to-
         end because header fields such as To and Via need to be
         visible to proxies so that the SIP request can be routed
         correctly"

       When, To field will be used by the proxy to route the request.
       What I understood from the RFC is that proxy will look Request-
       URI to route the request.

     thanks in advance.

  rakesh

Hi,

Again, we assume that the GWs support ISUP transparency, because if the
GW only supports ISUP/SIP mapping it will not be able to know if to
generate an ACM when the 18x is received - even if the GW would be smart
enough to notice that there is SOME ISUP message in the 180 response.

Personally, I still think that a separate provisional response code
(I've been using 186 as an example) should be used, and any UAC (SIP
phone or PSTN GW) supporting overlap dialing must understand the
response. And, if the UAC knows it has already sent all digits,
receiving a 186 could, for example, cause it to send a CANCEL to the
INVITE, instead of waiting for the ISUP digit timers to expire and
receive a 486 final response.

Hi,

The discussion about overlap dialing has been pretty much about calls
from SIP to PSTN, or PSTN-SIP-PSTN.

Consider the following scenario.

PSTN PHONE             GW           SIP SERVER      SIP UAS
-----------------------------------------------------------

--- 1 --->    -- IAM -> | -- INVITE -->  |
                        | <- 18x ------  | 
--- 2 --->    -- SAM -> | -- INFO ---->  |
                        | <- 200 (INFO)  |
                        | <- 18x ------  |
--- 3 --->    -- SAM -> | -- INFO ---->  |
                        | <- 200 (INFO)  |   -- INVITE
-->                                            
                        | <- 200 (INVITE)|   <- 200 ------ 

In this case, the SIP server (note that I am not using the word 'proxy')
must collect digits, sent from the PSTN side using overlap dialing, to
be able to find the SIP UAS, and INFO is used to provide the digits
after the INVITE has been sent.

My question is, should a SIP server (proxy, if you like) be allowed to
behave like this, or MUST it send 486s, and receive new INVITEs, until
it is able to find the UAS?

I would like to clarify the scenario a little.

The SIP server is NOT a normal proxy in the SIP network, via which the
INVITE is routed to the UAS (if it was, we would use 486 responses until
the proxy can route the call to the UAS, like Tom proposed earlier in
the Operlap Dialing thread).

Instead, the server could be some kind of automatic phone switch, for
example connected to a VPN. The difference from a NAT would be that it
is connected directly to a number of UAS, so it needs the digits to be
able to find the correct UAS.

If the UAS would be, for example, a PSTN phone, the SIP server would be
a PSTN GW, so then it would be allowed, but what is it wants to use the
same logic to route a call to another network using SIP (or, maybe
another VoIP protocol).

In your text  do you mean 484 and not 486 ?

If it is legal for a gateway interworking with the PSTN to gather
digits using the INFO message and responding with some 18X response
then I don't see why it can't be legal for the server you have defined in this
scenario.

Such a server now has two choices for collecting digits; it either issues a 18X
and
waits for further digits in the INFO message, or it issues 484 and waits for the
subsequent INVITE.

The choice will probably be dictated by the implementationof the digit decode.
If the implementation for
decoding digits is more efficiently used by starting it off and then passing it
subsequent digits, the 484 method would be inefficient as this would mean
clearing
down the algorithm state between INVITEs and starting it off again on the
subsequent
initial INVITE (as otherwise there is a problem with the subsequent initial
INVITEs
getting to the same server as I have previously highlighted); if the
implemtation is equally
efficient whether it decodes anew each time or on a digit string  by digit
string basis, then the 484
method would be the best.

Regards,

I would like to clarify the scenario a little.

The SIP server is NOT a normal proxy in the SIP network, via which the
INVITE is routed to the UAS (if it was, we would use 486 responses until
the proxy can route the call to the UAS, like Tom proposed earlier in
the Operlap Dialing thread).

Instead, the server could be some kind of automatic phone switch, for
example connected to a VPN. The difference from a NAT would be that it
is connected directly to a number of UAS, so it needs the digits to be
able to find the correct UAS.

If the UAS would be, for example, a PSTN phone, the SIP server would be
a PSTN GW, so then it would be allowed, but what is it wants to use the
same logic to route a call to another network using SIP (or, maybe
another VoIP protocol).

Surely, if a GW is mapping ISUP to SIP (and vice versa) then there must be rules
to dictate
which SIP messages map to which ISUP messages and in what context. In fact,
aren't these the rules
we are debating ? The point being that even if a GW is ONLY performing
SIP/ISUP/SIP mapping
then it STILL MUST know when to genrate the ACM as part of the mapping function,
REGARDLESS of
transparency.

Hi,

Again, we assume that the GWs support ISUP transparency, because if the
GW only supports ISUP/SIP mapping it will not be able to know if to
generate an ACM when the 18x is received - even if the GW would be smart
enough to notice that there is SOME ISUP message in the 180 response.

Personally, I still think that a separate provisional response code
(I've been using 186 as an example) should be used, and any UAC (SIP
phone or PSTN GW) supporting overlap dialing must understand the
response. And, if the UAC knows it has already sent all digits,
receiving a 186 could, for example, cause it to send a CANCEL to the
INVITE, instead of waiting for the ISUP digit timers to expire and
receive a 486 final response.

Yes, and since it may not be possible to have rules when a 180 should
generate a ACM, and when it should not. So, in the case of overlap
dialing, when the 18x is only used to "ask" for more digits, my
suggestion was to use a specific provisional response code that would
not generate an ACM. 

Then, when we want an ACM to be generated, no matter if ISUP
transparency is supported or not, we would send a 180 Alerting.

There was an effort started several IETFs ago to define a PROTOCOL
to exchange geographic location.  That was shot down.  There is still
a low level effort to define a format for exchanging such information.

Before starting another effort, you might want to look at the prior
work (spatial).  You also MUST forthrightly face up to the privacy
concerns that have stymied other efforts.  The security implications of
knowing where you are can be VERY daunting, and in general discussions
on the issues have yielded more problems than answers.'

Brian,

It seems that the privacy draft faces up squarely to the privacy
concerns.  The draft already deals with all the regulatory requirements
about verification of identity, hiding of identity, etc.  The security
implications of knowing who you are are just as daunting as knowing
where you are.  In some places regulations already cover location info,
and the framework in the privacy draft deals with them.

As with the subscriber identity - the UA may insert it, and may
demand (via a tag and a Proxy-Require) that it be kept private.
The proxies may verify the identity, and mark it verified, or mark
it unverified, and must delete the information if privacy was requested.
The procedures are all there in the privacy draft, and just need
some minor extensions to handle multiple identity types, and per-identity
privacy requests.

The previous efforts (spatial) generated a string giving location
information.  Sip uses "name-addr | addr-spec" everywhere, which
includes a display-name string; however a URL format would be nicer.
I was sure I had heard about a URL format with this information, but
can't find any reference to it.

There was an effort started several IETFs ago to define a PROTOCOL
to exchange geographic location.  That was shot down.  There is still
a low level effort to define a format for exchanging such information.

Before starting another effort, you might want to look at the prior
work (spatial).  You also MUST forthrightly face up to the privacy
concerns that have stymied other efforts.  The security implications of
knowing where you are can be VERY daunting, and in general discussions
on the issues have yielded more problems than answers.'

The problem that location presents that is different from the 
privacy draft (unless I missed it) is that an emergency call must
yield location information.  There is not an option for the user
to suppress this, by law.  The path by which a user might connect
to an emergency center cannot be pre-arranged.  I believe that it
will take creation of a cryptographically secure infrastructure
to allow such a system to have the desired property that the user
can control location information, but when required it can be
securely delivered.

I also think that location is not an "all or nothing" kind of
thing.  The privacy draft presupposes that the world is bifurcated
into trusted and untrusted domains, and privacy is secured
when venturing into an untrusted domain.  This is not the behavior
I really want. The desired behavior I want is:
	Accuracy (precision) of location is variable
		I may want to give some people precise information, others
		less precise.  There will be multiple levels
	Time (and motion) variability - if I am mobile, then where I
		am changes over time.  I need to express this somehow,
		but I also need to control it (not everyone can be told that
		I am mobile)
What we learned in the spatial effort is that the whole location thing
is more complex that you would like it to be, and it is hard to get
an implementable subset that has enough functionality to be interesting.
We also learned the difficulties in reaching consensus on issues that
involve privacy.

I think if we view the SIP Server as a B2BUA, the same reasoning does apply
as for the egress gateway to the PSTN: once the initial SIP call reaches the
SIP Server, the subsequent digits do not directly affect the state of that
initial call, and may therefore be carried in INFO messages.

I guess it's time to run through call flows and see whether the ingress
gateway can behave properly regardless of the signalling protocol beyond the
SIP Server.  I suspect Christer is right, and a 1xx response code indicating
that an onward call needs more digits is desirable.

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I would like to clarify the scenario a =
little.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; The SIP server is NOT a normal proxy in =
the SIP network, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; via which the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INVITE is routed to the UAS (if it was, we =
would use 486 </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; responses until</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the proxy can route the call to the UAS, =
like Tom proposed </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; earlier in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the Operlap Dialing thread).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Instead, the server could be some kind of =
automatic phone </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; switch, for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; example connected to a VPN. The difference =
from a NAT would </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; be that it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; is connected directly to a number of UAS, =
so it needs the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits to be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; able to find the correct UAS.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; If the UAS would be, for example, a PSTN =
phone, the SIP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; server would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; a PSTN GW, so then it would be allowed, =
but what is it </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; wants to use the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; same logic to route a call to another =
network using SIP (or, maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; another VoIP protocol).</FONT>

I see a few more messages in this thread, but I'll note now that your "SIP
Server" must be a back-to-back UA.  I'm not sure why it would send a 18x
response before it knew how to route the call to its final destination.

There is however a requirement in existing protocols for passing this
information around within network entities. Therefore you will see support
in ISUP, MAP, INAP and CAMEL for such an identifier. I believe that there is
requirement to be able to carry this identifier within SIP, although not in
"clear" to the user entities. Work done in ITU-T and in ETSI, both in the
services area and in the ISUP area, defined this identifier as another form
of calling line identity.

The usage in these protocols is all based on the same set of underlying
variants, of which the best definition in protocol independent terms is
probably in the following 3GPP reference 

TS 23.032.

3rd Generation Partnership Project; 
Technical Specification Group Core Network; 
Universal Geographical Area Description (GAD)

and which may be found at the following URL

ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/Specs/2000-12/R1999/23_series/23032-310.zip 

Due to the need to interwork between SIP and other protocols, it would
appear to be essential to maintain the same number and type of parameters
within the SIP encoding, although some difference will obviously have to
exist at the transfer level to allow a text encoding in SIP, while the other
protocols use a binary encoding.

This is not a matter of telling the IETF what to do, it is merely that every
other signalling protocol in the world appears to use a subset of these
formats.

The cited proposal uses WGS84, which is the accepted standard for
world coordinates.  I know that there is some variability in the precise
ellipsoid definitions that have some national variation.  I'm not enough
of an expert to know which version this represents, but it appears to offer
no variation, so they probably picked one and went on; a position I favor.
It also seems to have all of the variables one might want (including motion 
vectors).  So, I would agree that we want to have something very closely 
aligned with this format in terms of parameters.

I didn't see anything having to do with intentional degrading of
accuracy, so that is one missing capability.

An ordinary call must yield subscriber information.  There is
not an option for the user to suppress this, by law (although the
user may request this information not be given to the destination).
However, the destination can always identify the caller, for purposes
of tracing an obscene or harassing call.

Accuracy of location is certainly variable, and it is possible
the UA may permit delivery of less precise information, but suppress
accurate information.  Multiple levels are just like multiple identities;
the privacy draft as described by Mark in previous email allows separate
anonymity requirements to be attached to each.

The problem that location presents that is different from the 
privacy draft (unless I missed it) is that an emergency call must
yield location information.  There is not an option for the user
to suppress this, by law.  The path by which a user might connect
to an emergency center cannot be pre-arranged.  I believe that it
will take creation of a cryptographically secure infrastructure
to allow such a system to have the desired property that the user
can control location information, but when required it can be
securely delivered.

I also think that location is not an "all or nothing" kind of
thing.  The privacy draft presupposes that the world is bifurcated
into trusted and untrusted domains, and privacy is secured
when venturing into an untrusted domain.  This is not the behavior
I really want. The desired behavior I want is:
	Accuracy (precision) of location is variable
		I may want to give some people precise information, others
		less precise.  There will be multiple levels
	Time (and motion) variability - if I am mobile, then where I
		am changes over time.  I need to express this somehow,
		but I also need to control it (not everyone can be told that
		I am mobile)
What we learned in the spatial effort is that the whole location thing
is more complex that you would like it to be, and it is hard to get
an implementable subset that has enough functionality to be interesting.
We also learned the difficulties in reaching consensus on issues that
involve privacy.

If I have an enterprise network, and it connects to a public network, then
the trust boundary may stop at the private/public boundary.  The
"subscriber"
is the enterprise, not the individual.  In the privacy draft, if extended to
location, there is no mechanism to:
	Recognize that this is an emergency call
	Recognize that the UAS is the emergency center
	Pass location information despite any of the requests the UAC may
make.

Yet, the requirement is to identify the location of the individual.
I think the draft has some fine mechanisms in it.  I just don't think they
are 
sufficient for emergency purposes.

Hi all,
   Forgive if I misunderstand the discussion so far, but in the GSTN the call
party has control only over presentation. They have no control over the Calling
Line Identity being used within a network (and normally, on a "trust by wire"
system, it's the phone Network that sets/validates this anyway).

Thus, one might envisage a Network degrading the CLI it presents (maybe to only
the last four digits), but the E911 sub-system will still get the "full monty".

For Location Based Services it is/will be the same. This is one reason why some
Operators have stated that they will NOT trust location information calculated
by the Mobile Terminal/User. They will be responsible for delivering 
full location
info to the Public Services Access Point, and THEY want to do the 
calculation...
as before, they are the ones who will either set or validate the location.

Now...How they do this in a VoIP world is an interesting topic, IMHO.

-- 
All the best, Lawrence

Hi,

>Certainly using explicit SIP responses minimises the need to use context
>to determine what ISUP message to generate. I am not opposed to the idea
>of using a new response to indicate that some form of routing is taking >place at the egress (or beyond).

Of course, the UAS GW could send a 186 when it receives the first
INVITE, no matter if more digits will come or not. The 186 would only be
a more "safe" (you can use PRACK etc) way then 100 to provide the UAC GW
with Contact and/or Record-Route headers, and the UAC GW would not map
it into any ISUP message. Then, IF the digits in the INVITE were enough
to route the call to the final PSTN user, and the UAS GW receives an
ACM, it would map it into a 180 and send it to the UAC GW, which then
can map it to an ISUP message.

Another issue: The case we have now been discussing is fine for
SIP-to-PSTN and PSTN-SIP-PSTN scenarios. However, if we have a
PSTN-to-SIP scenario, we would probably not send INFOs. A SIP proxy
COULD (I presented this solution in another thread), of course, send 18x
and wait for more digits, but since the call in this case is not
completely routed (the proxy is not the end user from a SIP point of
view) it would probably send 484 responses until an INVITE with enough
digits to find the SIP UAS is found.

  PSTN PHONE  GW           SIP PROXY       SIP UA
--------------------------------------------------

  -- IAM -->      -- INVITE -->  
                  <- 484 ------
                  -- ACK ----->
  -- SAM -->      -- INVITE -->
                  <- 484 ------
                  -- ACK ----->
  -- SAM -->      -- INVITE -->   -- INVITE -->
                  <- 200 ------   <- 200 ------
                  -- ACK ----->   -- ACK ----->

So, in this case we would still have to use the 484/re-INVITE mechanism,
UNLESS the proxy is allowed to only send a 18x to the first INVITE and
then wait for more digits sent in INFO messages (like I showed in the
other thread).

After all, I think that operlap dialing is going to be used almost only
in PSTN-to-SIP (and PSTN-SIP-PSTN) cases. At least I have never seen a
SIP Phone that would send digits in separate messages (you type the
whole B-number, press 'send' and everything is sent in a single INVITE)

Hi Gonzalo,

I didn't say I am going to use INFO, but that is what has been proposed
earlier in this thread, so I assumed INFO would be used. The reason for
the discussion from the beginning was that the overlap signalling,
according to the SIP-ISUP mapping draft, may not work very well, and a
solution using 18x responses and INFO messages, instead of 484 and
re-INVITEs, was proposed.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Certainly using explicit SIP responses minimises the need to use context
to determine what ISUP message to generate. I am not opposed to the idea
of using a new response to indicate that some form of routing is taking place at
the egress (or beyond).

K. Robinson

Yes, and since it may not be possible to have rules when a 180 should
generate a ACM, and when it should not. So, in the case of overlap
dialing, when the 18x is only used to "ask" for more digits, my
suggestion was to use a specific provisional response code that would
not generate an ACM.

Then, when we want an ACM to be generated, no matter if ISUP
transparency is supported or not, we would send a 180 Alerting.

Ashutosh,

I may have misunderstood the question, but I think there are a couple of
concepts involved here.

To allow all SIP clients in a particular broadcast domain know about each
other, the 'Hello' message approach (or register message acting as a 'Hello'
type of message) is probably the simplest and lowest message overhead.

If there is a desire to allow devices within a broadcast domain know about
multicast sessions available in the domain then SAP/SDP could be used,
although it would probably be worth investigating how multicast applies to
adhoc networks - this discussion is probably not appropriate for the SIP
list.

Cheers,

Mick.

Michael, would you assume each Piconet member in the same subnet (broadcast
domain), can we define a well defined multicast address to get the listing
of
the users with SIP UA enabled in the neighborhood, and their contact
address,
may be by using something  like SAP/SDP.

Thanks
Ashutosh

Hi,

I had a look through the thread, and I still have one issue.

I do NOT think that we can assume that the PSTN GW will know how many
digits are needed to route a call to the PSTN end-user, so I don't think
we can use provisional responses to "ask" for more digits. Yes, the GW
may know how many digits it needs to route the call to the next PSTN
switch, but it doesn't know how many digits that switch needes, etc...

So, my proposal would be:

1. When the INVITE has been routed to the GW UAS, the only response sent
back is 100. That would, of course, assume that we have to add Contact
and/or Record-Route headers in the 100 response...

2. Then, the UAC would use INFO to send more digits to the UAC, which
would forward them as SAMs. No, the GW would not "ask" for more digits,
but does it really have to? If the UAC wants to send more digits, it can
do so anyway, so...

3. THEN, when the GW receives ACM from the PSTN side, it would send a
18x provisional response back to the UAC. The UAC would now know that no
more digits are needed to route the call. Of course, we can get a
"please enter your code"-message, and be asked to provide digits, but
that is another issue.

We should remember that the GW SIP UAS may not even know that the UAC is
sending more digits, because it may send them in encapsulated ISUP
messages. In that case, however, the GW SIP UAS will not know it's SAMs,
so it couldn't make a decission on if to send 186 "Gimme more digits" or
not...

Dear all,

This is Takumi Ohba, NTT.
I have some questions concerning handling of over-length messages.


One example;
If a user want to attach very large data to a SIP message as a MIME part,
but it make the message longer than the MTU, what should the user do?
The only choice to the user is to give up attaching the data?

Another example;
A SIP proxy may receive a larger message that it can transfer.  This may
happen when the proxy uses different transport layers for incoming and
outgoing links and the outgoing link has smaller maximum datagram packet
size than that for the incoming link.
For example, the incoming link uses UDP (max: 64k octets) and the outgoing
link uses signalling AAL (max: 4k octets).  The proxy may receive 5k-octet
message if the MTU permits it, but it cannot transfer the message to the
outgoing signalling AAL link.

In this case, what should the proxy do?
Should it give up transferring the massage itself, or shorten the message
and transfer it by discarding less important part of the message?  In the
latter case, how can the proxy identify less important part of the message?


Best regards,
Takumi Ohba

Hello Christer,

Why are you using INFO for sending extra digits?

Please, check the SIP-ISUP mapping draft, overlap signalling section.

While the current privacy draft identifies that a user requesting "full"
privacy will receive this, I do not believe it is true. The current PSTN,
ISDN and mobile network service definitions all provide for some special
users (normally law enforcement agencies or emergency attendants) who have
access to this information no matter what the anonymity aka restriction
parameters indicate. I think the privacy draft needs to identify that
certain categories of user will exist that override the anonymity setting,
and that this is a "national option" of whatever the IETF equivalent of such
terminology is.

This will vary between different services. For emergency calls, the current
location at the time at which the INVITE was sent is probably sufficient.
Location information in other protocols does include both accuracy and
velocity indicators, if such are required. Other services may require a more
continuous update of location - at some point this ceases to become
something that the SIP protocol should provide and becomes something that
should be in a separate media stream. Any views on where this breakpoint is
reached?

We could end up here building something that does everything, but is over
complex.

I would note that we have two potential mechanisms to cater for this:

i)	the same location could be repeated in a request, each intended for
different service capabilities and with different levels of accuracy. One of
the proposals is to repeat the Remote-Party-ID header. Thus a highly
accurate location could be propagated with the request for emergency calls,
and a somewhat more general location could be propagated to a server
providing location based services.

ii)	the final proxy before a untrusted hop is reached could reduce the
accuracy of location information.

I am not sure how we would go about specifying this behaviour generically
for all identifiers. It could be done for certain identifiers in an
application specific manner.

Hi,

I think it has been agreed that a SIP message, including possible MIME
message bodies, should "fit" into a single UDP MTU. Do you have an
example where that length would not be enough?

In addition to the current discussion on location, I wanted to add some
words on the following part of Marks comment.

I do believe within any individual session, and for any endpoint, there are
multiple identities that need to be exchanged. 

We either have the option of specifying these in the RFC, or allowing to be
added as IANA registered enhancements, or a combination of both. Before we
decide this, we possibly need to get some idea of the number of different
identities people may want. I think this involves adding definitions to the
terms that Mark has identified.

We should also note that we already have a number of identities already
existing in the draft, depending on the endpoint we are talking about. For
the calling endpoint we have the From header and the Contact header. These
may fulfil some of the functions of i) and ii) in Mark's list.

I would like to propose two definitions which I believe should be covered by
an extended privacy draft (note that these are currently phrased from the
viewpoint of the calling endpoint, and would need to be modified to cover
other endpoints:

	Logical Calling Subscriber ID
	A URL that identifies the owner of the telecommunications
subscription of the user originating the session.

	Logical Calling User ID
	A URL that identifies the calling user, and that shall at least be
suitable for making a return session establishment.

It is the second of these that I would expect to be used in a Calling Line
Identification Presentation Service. The first would need to accompany any
emergency call, or be used for any malicious call identification.

To add a further issue to the current discussions on privacy.

The current specification of trusted versus untrusted really only deals with
the presentation of information to untrusted entities.

In the ISDN/PSTN world there is also the concept of information being
provided by an untrusted source, for example an separate enterprise network,
or a user attached to that separate enterprise network. 

In some cases the untrusted source may be the only entity able to provide
truly accurate information. Therefore for Calling Line Identification
Presentation there is a special indicator of user provided unscreened.

This means that in ISDN we have an either or situation for CLIP, the user is
either told:

-	this is the number for dialback purposes, but you cannot trust the
reliability of this information because I cannot check it.

or

-	this is the number for dialback purposes, but I have only provided
you with the information I can check, therefore it may not get you back to
the real source of the call, but only to the enterprise network that sourced
it.

In SIP we could have the possibility of providing both, but we would need to
discuss how we would identify these identifiers. For example two different
identifier tags in the Remote-Party_ID header, or a common identifier tag,
but a separate indication of level of screening.

                            Call for Papers for the
                   Voice over IP (VoIP) Technology Conference
                           Denver, 20-23 August 2001

Part of SPIE's ITComm 2001 - International Symposium and Exhibit on the
Convergence of Information Technology and Communication Technologies, 20-24
August 2001, Denver, Colorado.

Conference Chair: Petros Mouchtaris, Telcordia Technologies

Program Committee:
Flemming Andreasen, Cisco
Dimitris Kabilafkas, OTE R&D
Fuchun (Joe) Lin, Telcordia Technologies
Dave McDysan, WorldCom
Seshadri Mohan, Comverse
Petros Mouchtaris (Chair), Telcordia Technologies
Rajesh Talpade, Telcordia Technologies

The convergence of information and communication technologies has allowed the
use of data networks for offering voice and multimedia services. When Voice over
IP (VoIP) was first introduced commercially in the mid-nineties it was marketed
as an inexpensive alternative to traditional telephone service. Quality of
Service was not a critical issue because users were willing to tolerate low
quality because of the low cost of the service. Today, large carriers with a
long tradition in offering high quality services are considering deployment of
VoIP. Also, VoIP has lost its low cost appeal because prices of traditional
telephone services have dropped dramatically. Long term success of VoIP will
depend on whether VoIP networks can provide high quality and can be used for
offering a wide array of exciting services that cannot be offered by traditional
telephone networks.

The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers, engineers and
users of VoIP technologies, with a focus on how carriers can offer exciting VoIP
services  that provide high quality of service to users. This conference is part
of the ITComm Symposium and Exhibit, which focuses on the convergence of
information and communication technologies. The symposium will take place in the
beautiful Denver/Boulder area, a fast-moving high technology corridor also
called "Silicon Mountain."

Authors are invited to submit abstracts in the following and related topics:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.  This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation
Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: SIP Call Control
	Author(s)	: R. Sparks
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-03.txt
	Pages		: 19
	Date		: 05-Feb-01
	
This document defines a SIP extension within the new Call Control 
Framework to provide Call Transfer capabilities.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-03.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-03.txt".

	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

This is certainly based on WGS84, as the intention when it was defined was
not to invent something new. I am not sure how well it now corresponds
because I have only ever worked from this document (as have ETSI, 3GPP and
ITU-T), and not from WGS84.

The document developed over time. For reasons of compatibility new
descriptions were added rather than modify old descriptions. The later
additions were principally "uncertainty" and "confidence" so you will find
some descriptions that include them and some that do not. I believe these
are the terms you are looking for.

By the way we do not need to cater for all descriptions in this document.
Rather it should be a shopping list where the selection of descriptions:

a)	fulfils the requirements of the SIP community
b)	can be mapped to those used by ISUP, MAP, INAP and CAMEL (and any
other protocols that people can identify as important but which I do not
know about).

The public network will likely be trusted in the sense that it promises to
obey the user's stated privacy requirements, indeed Data Protection
legislation will usually oblige the public network provider to do this.
Also, it will likely be a requirement of the public service that terminals
identify themselves in some way.

I do not think it likely that for Emergency calls, terminals/networks will
behave differently with respect to identity information than for normal
calls except that it will probably not be considered an infringement of
privacy to deliver identity information to an Emergency call centre even
when the user has requested it be kept private.

More complex is how does the public service provider verify the identity and
location information ? In the example above, the public service provider can
only be sure of the owner of the Enterprise network from which the call
came, and this may not translate into a single geographic location. The
network would be forced to send forward only the 'unverified' location
information provided by the caller.

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The public network will likely be trusted in the =

the public service that terminals identify themselves in some =
way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I do not think it likely that for Emergency calls, =
terminals/networks will behave differently with respect to identity =
information than for normal calls except that it will probably not be =
considered an infringement of privacy to deliver identity information =
to an Emergency call centre even when the user has requested it be kept =
private.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>More complex is how does the public service provider =
verify the identity and location information ? In the example above, =
the public service provider can only be sure of the owner of the =

   Ick. This sounds like just the kind of thing that
   _shouldn't_ be handled at the protocol level, but
   instead at the service deployment level with the
   necessary agreements. Why can't the UAC look at
   the INVITEE's identity to determine if it wants
   to give out its identity after all? Why can't you
   make the proxy log INVITE's with calling anonymity
   requested and then the cops can get it out of the logs
   if required?

Mick, I was not  suggesting for  multicast sessions, rather ability of these
adhoc clients to annouce that they are SIP UA capable and they can do so by
announcing their parameters in a well  known multicast address (pre-provisioned)
by use of SAP/SDP so that other clients  in the neighborhood can figure out
about the existence of SIP clients. Only thing in this method is that , the
adhoc clients should be multicast capable.

Thanks
Ashutosh

Hi,

I have some questions concerning informing the UA in case the network 
de-registers the UA, and wants to inform the UA about this.

Let me describe a possible use case:  Supposed the UA normally registers
to only one registrar. Furthermore this registrar needs some maintenance
break. The policy in this registrar/network is, to inform all its
registered UAs, that they have been de-registered (and maybe provide an
address, where it can send a new registration.)
Remark: There can be more reasons, why a network element needs to
de-register a user, maintenance break is just one.


My questions:

- Has this problem area been addressed earlier in IETF?
  If yes, please send me some pointers.

- What do key-people think about such a feature, where a registrar
  informs about de-registration of users? Is it welcome to include it
  into a SIP extension (e.g. defining a method for it e.g. UNREGISTER,
  or re-using other methods such as NOTIFY), or whatever would be
  appropriate?

br,
 Bernie

You seem to have two comments:

i)	that this is a service issue and should not be dealt with at the
protocol level. I do have some sympathy with this. However the privacy draft
does not stop at the protocol level, and does define that in full anonymity
is requested the information is supressed at the last proxy in the trusted
network, which I guess you would defined as a service level requirement.
Even at the protocol level, we do need a common understanding of the
semantics of all the codings, and in my belief, "full" can never mean full
anonymity to all potential recipients. Therefore even if we remove all the
service aspects, we should be extremely clear about the semantics of the
defined values.

ii)	you seem to be querying whether such a requirement exists at all,
and propose to leave everything to analysing call logs. In public networks,
all emergency attendents will be specified to automatically have access to
such information. They need to assess whether the call is meaningful from
that URL (as part of the input to quickly identify malicious calls -
something that is an increasing problem throughout the world) and also as a
means to reestablishing the call should it be terminated before completion
(assuming the call has failed for only a temporary condition). No scanning
of call logs is going to fulfil this requirement. I believe this requirement
is general for all public networks. In addition, in some countries it
appears to be part of the regulatory framework that certain classes of users
have access to restricted identities, and therefore public networks in those
countries have to provide a means of supporting it. I believe, but have no
further information, that the calls that might fall into this class are
non-emergency calls to the police, i.e. calls that fulfil some of the
requirements of emengency calls but not all of them, e.g. with regard to
urgency of response.

Subject:  Re: [SIP] Overlap call setup  (Document link: Keith Robinson)

I have recently been trying to get clarification on the implemenation of
overlap sending; see attached for the discussion that has taken place
so far.

Certainly, the mechanism outlined (very sketchily) in RFC2543bis-02 sect 4.2.1
is fundamentally flawed. The Request-URI cannot be used to carry extra digits
as the Record-Route/Route mechanism would end up overwriting the R-URI
and therefore the subsequent digits would be lost.

This then leads to the idea of using the TO field as described in
sip-isup-00-00.txt;
however, I have the following issues with the mechanisms described in this
document :

As the TO field is different on each subsequent INVITE, then it is a new call
leg
on an existing call id; RFC2543bis-02 sect. 11.5 does not state what a UAS
should make of this. If you follow the logic in 11.5 you get to case (3), but
here it only defines the behaviour  if the TO and FROM fields match.

The 484 sent backwards kills that call attempt (but not the state for that
Call-Id -
is this problematic for intermediate proxies ?) so subsequent INVITEs will
actually be initial INVITEs. As these INVITEs must get to the same terminating
UAS,
the originating  UAC will have to create a ROUTE header in an initial INVITE
using ,
at least the CONTACT address from the 484. This implies the use of source
routing, an
issue that I don't believe has been fully resolved, and even if it is and
becomes part
of the base protocol some administrations may be reluctant to admit initial
INVITEs
which try to circumvent their routing policy, so may reject such INVITEs.

Also on the above point, the CONTACT address in the 484 must have the same
semantics as that in a 200 response so that a ROUTE header can be built; however
RFC2543bis-02 sect. 6.14 specifies that a CONTACT address in 4XX responses
indicates a location where additional error information can be found. Indeed, in
a recent
thread entitled Announcements in SIP (401 & 407 Contact) J. Rosenberg believes
that
Record-Route does not make sense in any non-200 response.

I would raise the question of whether the 484 response has any use in overlap
sending
(certainly in the case of ISUP) at all. If a node receives insufficient digits
to decode than it will wait until it receives some more from the preceding node
(or end of
dialling timers mature). If the preceding node receives subsequent digits and
end of dialling
has not been detected then it will pass them on. If the 484 indicated the
minimum number of
digits before a decode could take place, then it would be useful in cutting down
the number
of subseqent messages sent.

Indeed, isup-sip-00.txt does cover the mechanism where a 183 is sent, and not a
484.
The case in point is covered in sect. 11.3 (Example of SIP bridging and overlap
signalling);
However, I have the following issues with this mechanism:

As before relies on source routing.

Relies on proxies sending requests on new call legs but existing call-ids to the
same
downstream server; fine if you administer these proxies, what if you don't ?
(Lots of
wasted IAMs generated). The mechanism should not send 5 (subsequent INVITE)
until it has received an acknowledgement (probably not 100) from the first.
Alternatively,
the Reason-Phrase could detail more specifically the exact progress of the call
("Decoding Address"
in this case ?) so that the ACM is not generated unconditionally.

Sect. 11.2 encourages gateways "to return a183 Session Progress with a Contact
header as soon as they receive an INVITE that they are going to handle and might
contain
an incomplete number". Presumably this is to allow the UAC to build a ROUTE so
that subsequent
INVITEs get to the appropriate UAS. Sect 7.2.3 indicates that a node receiving a
183 prior to generating
an ACM should generate an ACM. Applied together these rules  may cause a prior
node to never
send on any subsequent digits and overlap sending would fail.

I think an approach is required whereby subsequent digits are sent on the same
call leg as the
initial INVITE; either multiple INVITEs are allowed before 200 OK (already
suggested by J. Rosenberg
in a different context) , or the INFO method is used. In both cases the TO field
will have to remain the
same so a new header (or message body type) is required to convey the digits.
Also, replace the 484
with, say, 18X indicating the minimum number of digits required, perhaps in the
Reason-Phrase header.

Regards,

Keith Robinson.

Greetings,

I would like to ask for clarification regarding the implementation of
Overlap.

I'll begin by referring to paragraph 3, section 6.1.2 of
"draft-ietf-isup-sip-00":

It is stated that INVITEs sent after the first one (containing extra digits
in the 'To' field) are to be treated as new Call-Legs, seeing as the
contents of their 'To' headers differ. As such, there is no relationship
between their CSeq values.

If this is the case, how is it possible to ensure correct digit ordering
over an 'unreliable' transport layer like UDP? It would seem logical that
the call originator _would_ use contiguous CSeq values, as it would be
'aware' of the fact that the INVITEs are for the same call.

I believe that this issue was raised on the SIP list on 19 November 1999 by
Gonzalo C and Jonathan R. The subject of the messages was "Re: Comments on
draft-camarillo-mmusic-sip-isup-bcp-00.txt". The outcome of the exchange
appeared to be an agreement that CSeq ordering should be employed.

However, does this in any way imply that under such circumstances the
INVITEs would/should belong to the same Call-Leg? After all, the concept of
Overlap does not seem to 'fit in' with the concept behind multiple Call-Legs
anyway.

If there has been a change in thinking behind the problem, and the latest
draft is correct, please could you explain how the ordering problem will be
overcome. If not, perhaps the draft needs modification to include these
considerations...

   I don't see what the problem is here. The proxy that
   suppresses caller id is a trusted third party. Part
   of the implicit agreement between my UA and the 
   proxy is that certain entities -- 911 centers, etc, --
   will always have access to my caller id. If you 
   don't like that service, then don't use that proxy.

   And what, exactly, is the problem of having a back door
   interface to call logs for certain people? I think it
   would be pretty trivial to hack up a http GET that did
   this, for example, and that's just off the top of my
   head -- there's probably a dozen other better ways to
   skin that cat. Heck, if E911 has static routing entries at
   the proxy, it doesn't even need a back channel
   since it would know that the caller id
   shouldn't be scrubbed.

   *My* point is that SIP being required to define
   classes of users to have certain privileges
   begs an enormous number of questions, not the
   least of which is designing for a particular
   system which the IETF don't do.

   That's not necessarily the case. Assuming that the there
   isn't a fog box in the middle, the UA could sign the
   request which the public service provider could verify.
   Or the enterprise could vouch for the identity of the
   user and/or location much like the PSTN does now.

Uh, what is exactly the "public network" that you are talking about? The
ISP to which my entreprise network connects have no idea of what the
bits in the packets are, and probably don't want to know. The basic SIP
solution is end-to-end, with the network being essentially transparent.
Sure, there may be competing voice service providers that want to
provide added value on top of the basic service, but we cannot assume
that there has to be a man in the middle.=20

	The public network will likely be trusted in the sense that it
promises to obey the user's stated privacy requirements, indeed Data
Protection legislation will usually oblige the public network provider
to do this. Also, it will likely be a requirement of the public service
that terminals identify themselves in some way.

	I do not think it likely that for Emergency calls,
terminals/networks will behave differently with respect to identity
information than for normal calls except that it will probably not be
considered an infringement of privacy to deliver identity information to
an Emergency call centre even when the user has requested it be kept
private.

	More complex is how does the public service provider verify the
identity and location information ? In the example above, the public
service provider can only be sure of the owner of the Enterprise network
from which the call came, and this may not translate into a single

The bis-02 version says 
Branch Parameter = f(To, From, Call-ID, Request-URI, Seq number of CSeq)

where 'f' is some hashing function.
Which part of the From and To is this referring to  - the
addr-spec portion ?  Does it not assume that addr-spec
of From and To headers are byte-by-byte equal. I thought
From and To headers should be compared by comparing
  - the addr-spec portion ( per the rules of URL comparison)
  -  the tag and possibly extension params ??
Now, as we all know 2 URLS may be equal but may not be 
byte-by-byte equal. So, how does this branch parameter
scheme work ??

Thanks,
Shail

There is no equivalent, since there are no national IETF standards.
Anything that relies on end systems "being nice" (i.e., doing things
they have no interest in doing) is per definition doomed in the Internet
that we know. Thus, we can assume that devices will provide accurate
information when making a 911 call (since the end system can easily know
that this is an emergency call), but if law enforcement has the illusion
it can rely on that on other calls, they need to find a different
Internet to play in. Should a proxy want to enforce or insert it, those
users that are so inclined will find a different proxy.

I don't see this as a problem if we can arrange for an end-to-end public
key for PSAPs (or one of the copies of the entity that routes to PSAPs)
stored in end systems.

This seems like a SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY operation until the request rate
reaches some threshold. I don't think that there is a hard threshold,
since this depends solely on the resources one wishes to expend on this
and with end-to-end notifications, the effort for "the network" isn't
all that large. I would guess that most would agree that 10 msg/sec is
probably excessive (and calls for a media stream) and that one
message/minute is probably ok, but we'll differ on the points in
between.

I do not see here a big problem for a UA. If the UA is a gateway, it
will handle the overlap signalling properly. If it is a pure SIP UA, it
will answer the first INVITE with a 484 (or  "Not found response") and
process the second INVITE properly.

There was a big thread about source routing. This kind of source routing
is fine. Current proxies handle it properly.

If a proxy sees an INVITe with a route header, it does not know if it is
the first INVITE or a re-INVITE. Thus, it will work properly.

Even if the proxy stores state and it receives a INVITE (non re-INVITE)
with a route header, it should honor it. Otherwise, the proxy is not
robust. This allows a call stateful proxy to lose state, re-boot and
still be able to route requests properly.

This contact header that is going to be used is the one present in the
183, not in the 484. This solves the problem of several IAMs al the same
time. If the answer was a 484, no IAM was sent. Thus, the next re-INVITE
with more digits can be very well handled by a different gateway.

484 responses are not very useful in this scenario, but they might be
useful in anothers (when a UA can ask the user to type more digits, for
instance).

See comments above about this type of source routing.

Why would you want to limit a call to one call leg??

Lots of IAMs?????

The situation where more than one (typically two) IAMs are generated is
when the 183 arrived to the ingrees gateway after it sent the first
re-INVITE. This situation is ulikely to happen anyway, because if you
receive subsequent digits so fast (faster than a RTT), you should
implement a timer, and not send LOTS of SAMs anyway.

Again a timer configuration problem. You can, and your re-INVITE will
most likelt reach the same egrees gateway as the 1st one... but it might
reach a different one. Thus, the ingrees gateway should be aware of this
and be ready for canceling one of the TWO IAMs sent if this happen.

But again, this situation is not common.

YES.

The same way that nodes handling overlap signalling do not release the
call upon reception of a 484, they will not generate ACMs upon reception
of a 183 without SDP and without an ancapsulated ACM... we might want to
add this clarification to the draft.

Stacking requests is not a good solution in this case. It leads to a lot
of problems that we certainly want to avoid.

If INFO is used any vanilla SIP UA should implement INFO in order tor
receive calls/sessions that use overlap signalling. One of the most
important requirements for overlap signalling in SIP was that a vanilla
SIP UA could handle it.

 In both cases the TO field

Again, we do not want to implement this in vanilla SIP UAs.

Dear Holmberg,

Thank you for your reply.

In my understanding, a SIP message may include user-to-user information, suc
h as an image file.
Such information can be very large, say 100k byte or more.

In addition, some transport layer protocols have poorer max length than UDP.

I think that SIP needs explicit specification for handling of over-length me
ssage, or I don't think this is a good idea but SIP should specify simple me
ssage segmentation procedures like as ISUP.

Comments?

Regards,

We have a protocol called TCP for that. The sender should know, to
reasonably degree, what the max. message size is and switch to TCP as
needed (or SCTP, if that floats your boat). For very long responses, the
UAS can redirect to a transport=tcp URL.

Just  to clarify, I don't mean comparison
of From with To, but comparison of From
header as stored in transaction state with
what is received in a PDU. Similarly for
To header.
Basically, my question is hash output of
equivalent From headers would be different,
so should the hashing be done on "normalized"
URL components or the unparsed addr-spec.



Thanks,
Shail

There is currently an "rpi-screen" parameter defined in the privacy draft which
basically tags the Remote-Party-ID as verified/screened or not. I'm not sure I
understand why it doesn't address what you want to achieve here.

Your point is well taken, but I don't think the specific examples apply.

Note that there is an inherent conflict between anonymity and providing identity
information in the From header, which was part of the motivation for the
Remote-Party-ID originally.

As far as the Contact header is concerned, I also don't think it covers (or
should cover) subscriber/user identity. We had discussed if it perhaps covered
the terminal identity, and while you conceivably could construct an argument for
that, it would inherently place restrictions on the format and information you
can provide in a Contact header. I think that would be an unfortunate
overloading of semantics, especially if we have a general Remote-Party-ID
mechanism that could be used instead, so I would argue against that.

I'll let Mark speak to these as they are his definitions, but I believe your
Logical Calling User ID combines a couple of Mark's identities in one, and I
don't that was his intention.

Just to re-hash, in the ISUP-SIP-ISUP context, once call signalling has
reached an egress gateway, SIP has done its job -- additional digits will
not change call state.  It is therefore reasonable to use INFO to carry the
additional digits.  If we are talking ISUP-SIP, once the destination UAS or
a UAS in a B2BUA has been reached, the same consideration applies.

This is a protocol issue because there are three entities,
the UAC, the outgoing proxy, and the incoming proxy (or UAS)
at the emergency center.  There has to be additional
specification that details how this works.  The spec probably
needs some MUSTs.  Some of the issues are:
	How does the UA indicate to the outgoing proxy that
	this is an emergency call?  What are the minimum
	requirements for caller identification and location
	that must be delivered from the UAC to the Proxy Server?

	How does the outgoing proxy server identify "right"
	emergency server?  What is the minimum requirement for
	caller identification and location that must be
	delivered from the outgoing Proxy Server to the center?
	Are there some minimum requirements for protocol options
	the emergency center (or proxy or gateway) must implement
	in order to provide the service needed?

It's not entirely clear to me that this is an IETF matter,
but it HAS to be done, somewhere.

Brian

I do not agree with these two statements:

The 1st INVITE (with just some digits) arrives to a vanilla SIP UA. I
will return a Not Found or a 484 Address incomplete. The subsequent INFO
carrying more digits will be discarded. Thus, the PSTN to SIP gateway
will have to re issue a new INVITE with all the digits. Therefore, it is
better to begin directly using er-INVITEs rather than INFO.

Besides, I do not think that SIP is just a transport protocol that
carries ISUP messages between two gateways. For that, we have already
SIGTRAN. SIP might be used to provide services, even when the call is a
PSTN-SIP-PSTN call. Thus, SIP messages MUST carry complete state. And a
SIP message with an incomplete to field does not carry complete state.
What if my SIP proxy provides a service for a PSTN-SIP-PSTN call based
on the to field (called party number). That proxy would like to see an
updated to field, not just a to field that contains just some digits.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

Sorry, we're talking past each other.  The premise of my statements is that
an INVITE has reached a UAS which has accepted it.  It follows that the UAS
did not send back a 484, but rather an interim response.  IF more digits
come along, the INFO method is there to carry them.  They do not affect the
SIP call state; they are used beyond the UAS, either in a PSTN call or in
another SIP call as the case may be.

<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Sorry, we're talking past each other.&nbsp; The =
premise of my statements is that an INVITE has reached a UAS which has =
accepted it.&nbsp; It follows that the UAS did not send back a 484, but =
rather an interim response.&nbsp; IF more digits come along, the INFO =
method is there to carry them.&nbsp; They do not affect the SIP call =
state; they are used beyond the UAS, either in a PSTN call or in =
another SIP call as the case may be.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Just to re-hash, in the ISUP-SIP-ISUP =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; has reached an egress gateway, SIP has =
done its job -- additional</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digits will not change call state.&nbsp; =
It is therefore </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; reasonable to use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INFO to carry the additional digits.&nbsp; =
If we are talking </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ISUP-SIP, once</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the destination UAS or a UAS in a B2BUA =
has been reached, the same</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; consideration applies.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I do not agree with these two =
statements:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The 1st INVITE (with just some digits) arrives =
to a vanilla SIP UA. I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; will return a Not Found or a 484 Address =
incomplete. The </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; subsequent INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; carrying more digits will be discarded. Thus, =
the PSTN to SIP gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; will have to re issue a new INVITE with all the =
digits. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Therefore, it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; better to begin directly using er-INVITEs =
rather than INFO.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Besides, I do not think that SIP is just a =
transport protocol that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; carries ISUP messages between two gateways. For =
that, we have already</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIGTRAN. SIP might be used to provide services, =
even when the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; call is a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; PSTN-SIP-PSTN call. Thus, SIP messages MUST =
carry complete </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; state. And a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIP message with an incomplete to field does =
not carry complete state.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; What if my SIP proxy provides a service for a =
PSTN-SIP-PSTN call based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; on the to field (called party number). That =
proxy would like to see an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; updated to field, not just a to field that =
contains just some digits.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't say I am going to use INFO, =
but that is what has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; been proposed</FONT>

INFO would be used. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; reason for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the discussion from the beginning was =
that the overlap signalling,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; according to the SIP-ISUP mapping =
draft, may not work </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; very well, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; solution using 18x responses and INFO =
messages, instead of 484 and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; re-INVITEs, was proposed.</FONT>

Still I want to have full state in every SIP message. If the call is
addresed to the phone number 1234, I want to have a to field that says
1234. I do not care if there is a leg routed thru the PSTN and another
thru SIP.

Carrying full state is one of the beauties of SIP. If we begin using
INFO for this, it would be the same as using SAMs. Differen names, the
same thing... I do not want to re-create ISUP using SIP. I believe that
if the session has a destination, it should be present in the to field.

Again, if a proxy is providing services for this particular call, it
will want to see the called party number in order to trigger the proper
service. This is a very good reason for updating the to field every time
we have more digits.

I like to use SIP between two gateways because it is possible to provide
SIP services for a PSTN to PSTN call. If all we want to do is finding a
egrees gateway, we would probably want to use other protocols (TRIP &
SIGTRAN for instance).

Regards,

Gonzalo

I have completed a version 03 of the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY draft. It
has been submitted to the drafts editor for publication; until
it becomes available, you may access it from:

http://briefcase.yahoo.com/bc/adamr?c&.flabel=fld6&.src=bc&start=1

I apologise for not having the bandwidth to release this much
earilier (considering that the interim meeting is in two days).

As always, discussion of this draft should take place on the
sip-events list, and not the general purpose SIP mailing list.
Instuctions for accessing the sip-events mailing list are included
in the draft itself.

I'm hoping that my 911 draft, either in its current form or a revised
version, will address the 'find the emergency response center'. There
are several parts to this question.

Hi, Gonzalo,

Some comments on three points in discussion.

(1)
>The same way that nodes handling overlap signalling do not release the
>call upon reception of a 484, they will not generate ACMs upon reception
>of a 183 without SDP and without an ancapsulated ACM... we might want to
>add this clarification to the draft.

One potential issue of this is 183 without SDP can also be interpreted as PSTN gateway (and the media gateway it associates with) needs to play (local) ringback for a SIP to PSTN call toward PSTN side phone for the cases the ringback cannot come from the remote SIP phone.

This can be resolved using a different Reason Phrase as Keith already indicated or another status code (186). To me it is better if a SIP status code always has unique semantics.

(2) 
>Why would you want to limit a call to one call leg??
If I understand correctly, the issue of multiple call legs appear becauses of definition of call leg. In the case of multiple INVITE with different To headers with accumulated digits (as your sip-isup draft suggested), if we relax that definition slightly: two messages belong to the same call leg if the number in one To header is a prefix of the number in another and the other conditions of the definition are met. To limit its impact, we can allow this change only on a SIP device (proxy) that interfaces with a PSTN gateway if possible (for pure SIP networks, the rfc definition is still followed). This way CSeq is useful.

I agree to have multiple call legs is fine in theory, but it is kind of against intuition to me and it might add some implementaion overhead too.

(3) INFO or To header for subsequent digits
I agree with your thoughts on using TO instead of INFO. However one obvious advantage of INFO is the saving of one message (ACK).
 
Regards,
Taichi

Vendors could mandate that their SIP/PSTN gateways will always block up digits
and do everything en bloc; thats fine.

I  was raising issues I had with the mechanism for supporting overlap sending if
it was required to be performed because a particular administration wants to
use overlap signalling.

Keith.

Keith,

I hope that I don't seem too obtuse, but why are you wanting to process=

overlap sending through SIP in the first place?  Why doesn't your
inter-working point merely collect all of the SAMs before it launches
the INVITE?

As I'm sure you are aware, overlap sending was just a way of getting
better performance through an antiquated PSTN by overlapping digit
analysis and routing with out-pusling.  A terminating switch (or a
switch at an inter-working point) should never SAM anyway!  Where are
you connecting your box in the PSTN that you are going to get overlap
sending?

Even if you do receive SAMs, what do you hope to achieve by attempting
to process them through the SIP network?

The only reason for including SAMs in ISUP was for backwards
compatibility with CAS trunking.  Even in the ISUP-SIP-ISUP case, the
fact that you have an ISUP switch on either side means that the
performance should be sufficient to do en bloc sending across the
inter-working.

As you know, the call cannot be connected until after the last digit is=

sent, anyway.  Overlap sending was a way to remove the digit out-pulsin=
g
delay from each CAS trunking hop and improve post-dial delay (a critica=
l
PSTN grade of service parameter).  Unless you have an inter-working
point (CAS trunk) on both sides of the connection (e.g., CAS-ISUP-SIP-I=
SUP-CAS)
and a lot of them at that (i.e.  CAS-CAS-CAS-ISUP-SIP-ISUP-CAS-CAS-CAS)=

there is no reason for overlap sending.

Even still, in this arrangement, I don't see the SIP hop as being able
to make routing decisions on the call (unless it is a proxy) until the
entire number is received.  Also, I would question the commercial
viability of:
                CAS-CAS-CAS-ISUP-SIP-ISUP-CAS-CAS-CAS

anyway.

Could you provide a practical example of when this would be necessary
and en bloc sending would not be sufficient at the inter-working point?=

Thanks for the reply. A few  points to clarify my thoughts:

On the issue of source routing, I am aware of the discussion that took (is still
taking ?)
place. My concern is not of a technical nature (it will work), it is of an
administrative nature; what
if an administration does not want soucre routing occuring in its domain for
security,
accounting reasons etc. It IS possible for a proxy to determine that an INVITE
is
an initial INVITE; it looks in the TO tag field and finds it blank which means
this MUST
be an initial INVITE as opposed to a subsequent INVITE on a call leg its
forgotten
about. So, a proxy MAY be configured to reject these INVITEs while still being
robust.
Thats why I suggested a solution that would not rely on source routing.

On the issue of vanilla UAs, I would not expect them to generate INFO; I would
expect them to get back
a 484 (or possibly 404) and so generate a new call attempt. Also, is it
realistic that a SIP UA is going to send
its digits in 'overlap mode' anyway ? Is it not more likely that a user is going
to enter the complete
digit string and then ask the UA to send this digit string; the digits either
decode to an endpoint somewhere
or translate to Number Unobtainable ?

The full address (or that received so far) could be carried in the INFO message
in a new header
or a parameter of the TO URL.

Having said this, I take your point about retaining state in a single SIP
message. If it is
mandated that SIP/PSTN gateways only ever signal en-bloc then the overlap
sending
issues are avoided.

Clarification of when to generate the ACM, along the lines of your posting,
would be useful.

I am still concerned that RFC2543bis-02 defines (very sketchily) overlap sending
in a
way that is flawed (using Request-URI). This needs addressing by the SIP
authors.

I do not see here a big problem for a UA. If the UA is a gateway, it
will handle the overlap signalling properly. If it is a pure SIP UA, it
will answer the first INVITE with a 484 (or  "Not found response") and
process the second INVITE properly.

There was a big thread about source routing. This kind of source routing
is fine. Current proxies handle it properly.

If a proxy sees an INVITe with a route header, it does not know if it is
the first INVITE or a re-INVITE. Thus, it will work properly.

Even if the proxy stores state and it receives a INVITE (non re-INVITE)
with a route header, it should honor it. Otherwise, the proxy is not
robust. This allows a call stateful proxy to lose state, re-boot and
still be able to route requests properly.

This contact header that is going to be used is the one present in the
183, not in the 484. This solves the problem of several IAMs al the same
time. If the answer was a 484, no IAM was sent. Thus, the next re-INVITE
with more digits can be very well handled by a different gateway.

484 responses are not very useful in this scenario, but they might be
useful in anothers (when a UA can ask the user to type more digits, for
instance).

See comments above about this type of source routing.

Why would you want to limit a call to one call leg??

Lots of IAMs?????

The situation where more than one (typically two) IAMs are generated is
when the 183 arrived to the ingrees gateway after it sent the first
re-INVITE. This situation is ulikely to happen anyway, because if you
receive subsequent digits so fast (faster than a RTT), you should
implement a timer, and not send LOTS of SAMs anyway.

Again a timer configuration problem. You can, and your re-INVITE will
most likelt reach the same egrees gateway as the 1st one... but it might
reach a different one. Thus, the ingrees gateway should be aware of this
and be ready for canceling one of the TWO IAMs sent if this happen.

But again, this situation is not common.

YES.

The same way that nodes handling overlap signalling do not release the
call upon reception of a 484, they will not generate ACMs upon reception
of a 183 without SDP and without an ancapsulated ACM... we might want to
add this clarification to the draft.

Stacking requests is not a good solution in this case. It leads to a lot
of problems that we certainly want to avoid.

If INFO is used any vanilla SIP UA should implement INFO in order tor
receive calls/sessions that use overlap signalling. One of the most
important requirements for overlap signalling in SIP was that a vanilla
SIP UA could handle it.

 In both cases the TO field

Again, we do not want to implement this in vanilla SIP UAs.

Hi All,

1) First as a reminder:

In the IETF anyone may attend any meeting. However, if you are not an
active participant on the SIP mailing list, it is unlikely that you will be
able to contribute, which is the point of the interim meetings. All
meetings are working meetings, not trade shows or training events. If you
are just interested in "lurking"--listening to the activities of the
working group, then rest assured that, per IETF policy, detailed minutes of
the meeting will be posted to the SIP mailing list.  Even if you are not
subscribed to this list, anyone can still access the archives.

Seating will be tight but (barely) adequate based on the number of people
who have emailed me.  So!  If you happen to live in Dallas and you haven't
posted to the list in the last week or two, you should really ask yourself
if you will be able to ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE to our collective discussions
before you show up.

2) That said, there is a minor change in the agenda.  To make it easier for
folks on the phone, let's start the conferencing discussion at 5:30 per the
agenda below.  

3) For folks calling in, please mute yourself immediately as soon as you
join the bridge, and when you are finished talking.  You can mute/unmute
yourself once you are active on the conference bridge by pressing 
# 5
Doing this will dramatically improve the sound quality for others on the
phone.  Muting yourself with # 5 will also prevent you from sending
cellular noise, key clicks, and/or hold music to the rest of the bridge.
If you generate such noise, I will forcibly disconnect you from the conference.

Those of you on the phone, please stay dialed in during breaks if you will
continue to participate, as the bridge performs garbage collection on
unused ports.

I will be checking my pager (rmahy@epage.cisco.com) and my email
(rohan@cisco.com) frequently during the meeting, so if there are problems,
you may send me a text message describing the problem.

Here is the dial in information.  (I have reserved 10 ports)

Thursday Feb 8th  0800 to 1300 Central Time
call 408 525 6064  use meeting ID 7474383  (SIPIETF)

Thursday Feb 8th  1300 to 1900 Central Time
call 408 525 4445  use meeting ID 7474384

Friday Feb 9th 0800 to 1300 Central Time
call 408 525 4445  use meeting ID 7474385

Friday Feb 9th 1300 to 1800 Central Time
call 408 527 2663 use meeting ID 7474386

4) The Agenda:

Note, this is a guideline only.  We will be taking plenty of breaks.  Those
of you on the phone, please stay dialed in during breaks if you will
continue to participate, as the bridge performs garbage collection on
unused ports.

 I've asked the relevant folks shown to moderate discussions in each area.  If
you have a draft or idea you have presented on the list and want to present
topics/issues, please contact them.  

Presentations should NOT be tutorial in nature and should list the
issues/choices/differences at hand.  Presentations must conform to the
usual IETF rules (no logos, etc.).

This is wrong. If local alerting has to be performed the proper 1xx
response is 180 Ringing. This has been pointed out several times in the

We discussed this idea also, and finally 183 seems OK for this
(providing a contact header for the gateway handling the call).

> If I understand correctly, the issue of multiple call legs appear becauses of definition of call leg. In the case of multiple INVITE with different To headers with accumulated digits (as your sip-isup draft suggested), if we relax that definition slightly: two messages belong to the same call leg if the number in one To header is a prefix of the number in another and the other conditions of the definition are met. To limit its impact, we can allow this change only on a SIP device (proxy) that interfaces with a PSTN gateway if possible (for pure SIP networks, the rfc definition is still followed). This way CSeq is useful.


I do not think tha streching teh definition of a call leg for a
particular interworking case is a good idea. I rather let the definition
as it is. We do not need to change it.

There are scenarios where a single call can have multiple call legs.
Multiple call legs are present in SIP since the beginning. I do not
think we should discuss them now.

If we take into account all the problems related to the use of INFO, a
message saved is not a big gain.

Hello,

The idea of using always en bloc was present in the first version of the
draft. However, when I presented in DC (some IETFs ago), folks wanted
overlap signalling to be present also in the draft. That's why we
developed such a mechanism.

Anyway, I agree that it will not be used a lot. However, it is good to
discuss the open issues related to the mechanism to try to resolve all
of them.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Gonzalo,

I thought at the beginning of this thread Keith Robinson identified a number
of fundamental flaws with the overlap mechanism in the draft. If I
understood rightly, these were:

1) UAS behaviour on receiving multiple INVITES for new Call Legs of the same
Call, but with different FROM and TO fields is undefined in the RFC
2) The UAC must use source routing to ensure that all these INVITES make it
to the same UAS
3) 183 is used to transport the CONTACT of the UAS to UAC, but 183 may also
cause a backwards ACM to be generated, cutting off further digits. 

I may have mis-understood some of the points slightly, and there may be
more.

Overlap is a feature of the legacy PSTN - I don't think we need to kill
ourselves making SIP support overlap in some kind of native way. Rather, a
simple mechanism which allows consenting UAs to negotiate the direct
exchange of overlap digits over a single Call Leg would be much better. It's
not the same as SAMs because we can negotiate this mechanism to be used only
once the UAS has been found. Until this point, calls without enough digits
are killed right away with 484s.

The price we pay for this is that intermediate proxies may not have access
to the full Called Party Number - but a proxy that needs this, that wants to
offer service on overlap calls, can always sniff the overlap digits as they
go past.

Regards,

Mark Watson

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 1st INVITE (with just some =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; vanilla SIP UA.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will return a Not Found or a 484 =
Address incomplete. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying more digits will be =
discarded. Thus, the PSTN to SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will have to re issue a new INVITE =
with all the digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; better to begin directly using =
er-INVITEs rather than INFO.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, I do not think that SIP is =
just a transport protocol that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; carries ISUP messages between two =
gateways. For that, we have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; already</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIGTRAN. SIP might be used to provide =
services, even when the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; call is a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; PSTN-SIP-PSTN call. Thus, SIP =
messages MUST carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; state. And a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIP message with an incomplete to =
field does not carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; state.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; What if my SIP proxy provides a =
service for a PSTN-SIP-PSTN call</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the to field (called party =
number). That proxy would </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; like to see</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; updated to field, not just a to field =
that contains just some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digits.</FONT>

I forgot to mention that I would not expect vanilla UAs to receive INFO either.
The digits received in the INITIAL would not address any endpoint
supported by the receiving UA so it generate 484/404. The preceding node would
then issue a new call attempt.

Subject:  Re: [SIP] Overlap call setup  (Document link: Keith Robinson)

Thanks for the reply. A few  points to clarify my thoughts:

On the issue of source routing, I am aware of the discussion that took (is still
taking ?)
place. My concern is not of a technical nature (it will work), it is of an
administrative nature; what
if an administration does not want soucre routing occuring in its domain for
security,
accounting reasons etc. It IS possible for a proxy to determine that an INVITE
is
an initial INVITE; it looks in the TO tag field and finds it blank which means
this MUST
be an initial INVITE as opposed to a subsequent INVITE on a call leg its
forgotten
about. So, a proxy MAY be configured to reject these INVITEs while still being
robust.
Thats why I suggested a solution that would not rely on source routing.

On the issue of vanilla UAs, I would not expect them to generate INFO; I would
expect them to get back
a 484 (or possibly 404) and so generate a new call attempt. Also, is it
realistic that a SIP UA is going to send
its digits in 'overlap mode' anyway ? Is it not more likely that a user is going
to enter the complete
digit string and then ask the UA to send this digit string; the digits either
decode to an endpoint somewhere
or translate to Number Unobtainable ?

The full address (or that received so far) could be carried in the INFO message
in a new header
or a parameter of the TO URL.

Having said this, I take your point about retaining state in a single SIP
message. If it is
mandated that SIP/PSTN gateways only ever signal en-bloc then the overlap
sending
issues are avoided.

Clarification of when to generate the ACM, along the lines of your posting,
would be useful.

I am still concerned that RFC2543bis-02 defines (very sketchily) overlap sending
in a
way that is flawed (using Request-URI). This needs addressing by the SIP
authors.

Regards,
K. Robinson

I do not see here a big problem for a UA. If the UA is a gateway, it
will handle the overlap signalling properly. If it is a pure SIP UA, it
will answer the first INVITE with a 484 (or  "Not found response") and
process the second INVITE properly.

There was a big thread about source routing. This kind of source routing
is fine. Current proxies handle it properly.

If a proxy sees an INVITe with a route header, it does not know if it is
the first INVITE or a re-INVITE. Thus, it will work properly.

Even if the proxy stores state and it receives a INVITE (non re-INVITE)
with a route header, it should honor it. Otherwise, the proxy is not
robust. This allows a call stateful proxy to lose state, re-boot and
still be able to route requests properly.

This contact header that is going to be used is the one present in the
183, not in the 484. This solves the problem of several IAMs al the same
time. If the answer was a 484, no IAM was sent. Thus, the next re-INVITE
with more digits can be very well handled by a different gateway.

484 responses are not very useful in this scenario, but they might be
useful in anothers (when a UA can ask the user to type more digits, for
instance).

See comments above about this type of source routing.

Why would you want to limit a call to one call leg??

Lots of IAMs?????

The situation where more than one (typically two) IAMs are generated is
when the 183 arrived to the ingrees gateway after it sent the first
re-INVITE. This situation is ulikely to happen anyway, because if you
receive subsequent digits so fast (faster than a RTT), you should
implement a timer, and not send LOTS of SAMs anyway.

Again a timer configuration problem. You can, and your re-INVITE will
most likelt reach the same egrees gateway as the 1st one... but it might
reach a different one. Thus, the ingrees gateway should be aware of this
and be ready for canceling one of the TWO IAMs sent if this happen.

But again, this situation is not common.

YES.

The same way that nodes handling overlap signalling do not release the
call upon reception of a 484, they will not generate ACMs upon reception
of a 183 without SDP and without an ancapsulated ACM... we might want to
add this clarification to the draft.

Stacking requests is not a good solution in this case. It leads to a lot
of problems that we certainly want to avoid.

If INFO is used any vanilla SIP UA should implement INFO in order tor
receive calls/sessions that use overlap signalling. One of the most
important requirements for overlap signalling in SIP was that a vanilla
SIP UA could handle it.

 In both cases the TO field

Again, we do not want to implement this in vanilla SIP UAs.

Can anyone state a reason for keeping the restriction?

Hi,

I've been working with H323 for a while now but lately have been reading
alot about SIP and must say I'm very impressed with it's simplicity and
power. The only question I have is reagarding it's video conferencing
capabilities. I've been led to believe it's a long way off ? I thought it
was as simple as establishing an RTP channel and agreeing a codec. 

Could someone please tell me I'm wrong and point me to an example of Video
conferecing via SIP? I can' t seem to find any. 

If I'm right could anyone clarify what is happening in relation to this.

Regards,
Mark

TIA TR-41.4 committee has been working on the E911 issues for while. There
are two choices of positioning technologies under consideration.
Network-based, which achieves positioning with a network management overlay
such as SNMP and Set-based, which uses positioning devices integrated into
the set. 

Some of the issues identified in this list as being out side of IETF area of
work should be forwarded to TR-41.4 (tr414@tiacomm.org) for further
discussion and inclusion into their work.

This is a protocol issue because there are three entities,
the UAC, the outgoing proxy, and the incoming proxy (or UAS)
at the emergency center.  There has to be additional
specification that details how this works.  The spec probably
needs some MUSTs.  Some of the issues are:
	How does the UA indicate to the outgoing proxy that
	this is an emergency call?  What are the minimum
	requirements for caller identification and location
	that must be delivered from the UAC to the Proxy Server?

	How does the outgoing proxy server identify "right"
	emergency server?  What is the minimum requirement for
	caller identification and location that must be
	delivered from the outgoing Proxy Server to the center?
	Are there some minimum requirements for protocol options
	the emergency center (or proxy or gateway) must implement
	in order to provide the service needed?

It's not entirely clear to me that this is an IETF matter,
but it HAS to be done, somewhere.

This is a matter of network policy, not a protocol issue.  If the SIP
network wants to enforce conversion to en bloc signalling it is free to do
so, but this can happen at any point in the signalling chain and would
actually be done most efficiently at the ingress gateway if it has the
necessary understanding of the dial plan.  If the network is prepared merely
to pass the ISUP through it is free to do so.

<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>This is a matter of network policy, not a protocol =
issue.&nbsp; If the SIP network wants to enforce conversion to en bloc =
signalling it is free to do so, but this can happen at any point in the =
signalling chain and would actually be done most efficiently at the =
ingress gateway if it has the necessary understanding of the dial =
plan.&nbsp; If the network is prepared merely to pass the ISUP through =
it is free to do so.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Hi Tom,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Still I want to have full state in every SIP =
message. If the call is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; addresed to the phone number 1234, I want to =
have a to field that says</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 1234. I do not care if there is a leg routed =
thru the PSTN and another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; thru SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Carrying full state is one of the beauties of =
SIP. If we begin using</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INFO for this, it would be the same as using =
SAMs. Differen names, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; same thing... I do not want to re-create ISUP =
using SIP. I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; believe that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; if the session has a destination, it should be =
present in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to field.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Again, if a proxy is providing services for =
this particular call, it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; will want to see the called party number in =
order to trigger </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the proper</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; service. This is a very good reason for =
updating the to field </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; every time</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; we have more digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I like to use SIP between two gateways because =
it is possible </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIP services for a PSTN to PSTN call. If all we =
want to do is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; finding a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; egrees gateway, we would probably want to use =
other protocols (TRIP &amp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIGTRAN for instance).</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not agree with these two =
statements:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 1st INVITE (with just some =
digits) arrives to a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; vanilla SIP UA.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will return a Not Found or a 484 =
Address incomplete. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying more digits will be =
discarded. Thus, the PSTN to SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will have to re issue a new INVITE =
with all the digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; better to begin directly using =
er-INVITEs rather than INFO.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, I do not think that SIP is =
just a transport protocol that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; carries ISUP messages between two =
gateways. For that, we have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; already</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIGTRAN. SIP might be used to provide =
services, even when the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; call is a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; PSTN-SIP-PSTN call. Thus, SIP =
messages MUST carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; state. And a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIP message with an incomplete to =
field does not carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; state.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; What if my SIP proxy provides a =
service for a PSTN-SIP-PSTN call</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the to field (called party =
number). That proxy would </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; like to see</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; updated to field, not just a to field =
that contains just some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digits.</FONT>

Rick - characterizing the requirement to request
permission from the user before proceeding as
doing some form of interactive query is misleading.

The REFER draft (in fact, the original TRANSFER draft)
states:
      A UA receiving a well-formed REFER request
      SHOULD request approval from the user to
      proceed (this request could be interactive
      or through configuration). 

The parenthetical comment is there for a reason. 
Current generation clients will have configured
policy that grants this approval, then next round
will have at least that and maybe, hopefully, 
something more.

Background for those who have joined conversation
later than last May - the original submission that
became the cc-transfer draft used a TRANSFER method.

I agree. If you want, you can do it. As you could also establish an HTTP
session between both gateways. You could also establish an FTP session
to transfer the ISUP messages between them. As you point out, the
network administrator can do with his network whatever he wants, and
enforce the policy he wants.

I was just saying that if we just want to transparently trasfer ISUP
messages between two gateways, SIP is not the best solution. This was my
comment. Of course it can be done, but it falls outside SIP's scope.

That's why I do not like the INFO solution.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

I have 2 questions about this message waiting draft:
(1) In the 2nd paragraph of section 5.1, "The Subscriber MAY also explicitly
fetch the current status at any time." How does a subscriber fetch the
status? Based on the draft, my guess is that the subscriber sends a
re-SUBSCRIBER message and expects the current status in a NOTIFY message.
Could the subscriber expect the current status in the 200 OK? (In this way,
we do not need that NOTIFY message for re-synchronization).
(2) I notice that there is no user's message information in the NOTIFY
message for re-synchronization. (There is user's message information in the
NOTIFY message when the status of the messages changes.) If a UA is shutted
down abnormally and lost all the information, how can it get the user's
message information when it is restarted? 
Thanks,

Be a bit more general, is it also possible to play some local
announcement (other than ringing) to PSTN side after received 183
without SDP? If so, how to differentiate? To interpret 183 without SDP
as 'dialing incomplete so no ACM yet' only is a rather strong assertion
and I see no advantage of it over a dedicated response code or reason
phrase.

In the case of multiple INVITE with different To headers with accumulated digits (as your sip-isup draft suggested), if we relax that definition slightly: two messages belong to the same call leg if the number in one To header is a prefix of the number in another and the other conditions of the definition are met. To limit its impact, we can allow this change only on a SIP device (proxy) that interfaces with a PSTN gateway if possible (for pure SIP networks, the rfc definition is still followed). This way CSeq is useful.

It should be clear from this thread thay it is in the context of overlap
signalling that I am not so in favor of multiple call legs. It is kinds
of artificial. After all, all those To headers convey just one number
and to me semantically to group them into one call leg is cleaner to
understand and to implement. Anyway, it is not a big issue and to have a
general consensus is probably more important than to find the optimal.

  We should rephrase it to say that any policy decisions must not ever
be interactive, but may be subject to local configuration policy.

  However, unlike your REFER draft, a HANDOFF (MOVE? TRANSFER?) is
useless if it cannot be performed immediately.  The intent is to
smoothly transition from a 3-way bridged conference to a 2-way call
between the unconnected participants.

  Regardless, in many (most?) cases the recipient of the HANDOFF will be
a call control server or PSTN gateway, which will be forced to rely on
local policy.

His point wasn't that it wouldn't fit into a UDP MTU, it's that it might not
fit into an ATM MTU, for example.

How's this for a scenario: lots of VIA's and computer generated URL's.  That
will pretty quickly fill a 4K ATM AAL5 MTU, or even the "safe" 540 byte UDP
WAN MTU.

Reminds me of the "how big should my buffer be" thread...  The answer is
"boundless".

Well, there is no such thing as a UDP MTU. There is an IP maximum packet
size, which is 64k. The MTU is different on each link, and the path MTU is
the minimum of the MTU along a message path. Should a packet arrive on a
link which is in excess of the MTU, it is fragmented. THis is done at the IP
layer, transparent to the applications. So, a proxy simply won't care that a
3k UDP packet arrived over ATM unfragmented, and will depart over ethernet
with an MTU of 1500 bytes, requiring fragmentation. Fragmentation is not a
great thing, as it has known error exponentiation effects, but functionally,
its completely hidden from the proxy. Thus, the problem that has been
described does not exist.

Sorry for being absent from sipml discussions.... I was on vacation and
generally been swamped. Following sip is a lot of work these days.

Anyway, a few comments on this. I realize we are discussing it today during
the meeting, hopefully this note can help set the stage for those
discussions.

Here is my summary of the differences between this draft and the REFER
draft:

1. additional headers for the triggered invite are specified within a body
part of the HANDOFF. In REFER, they are specified as header parameters in
the target's URL.

  I personally dislike the approach taken in HANDOFF. I don't understand why
it is needed.
  There is some gripe about complexity with ? separated headers in a URL,
but multipart
  is, IMHO, far harder.

2. the body of the HANDOFF can have SDP, presumably for simultaneously
putting media on hold and initiating the transfer (I believe, please correct
if I'm wrong). SDP in REFER has no meaning.

  I also dislike the approach in HANDOFF. It is turning HANDOFF into a
re-INVITE + REFER
  function. Now, ALGs in firewalls need to process HANDOFF to modify media
stream information. B2BUas need to do the same. As a matter of design, sip's
approach has been to modularize and separate functions. This is why we
changed BYE/Also to REFER followed by BYE. The argument made for the HANDOFF
approach is latency and message overhead. I believe this is a red herring in
practice, but its a matter of personal taste in protocol design.

3. The reffered-by equivalent in HANDOFF is generated by the transferee, not
transferor, and they are not signed.

  This is a huge security hole. It will allow me to take over call legs that
other parties have with each other. Bad.

4. The status of the handoff is conveyed in a re-INVITE in the reverse
direction (presumably so that media on hold can be turned off?) if it fails,
else a BYE if it succeeds.

  I don't like the mis-use of INVITE as a means to convey status for a
previous transaction. What if there are multiple previous REFER? How is the
status correlated to the REFER? What if the triggered generates a 300, which
is recursed by the transferee, then a 400? Which is returned? Are reason
codes returned? What about warning headers? Sounds like a real notification
mechanism is needed here. 

5. The triggered INVITE from the HANDOFF can contain a Replaces used to
replace the existing call leg between the transferor and target. This causes
the target to send a BYE to the transferor. In REFER, the transferor would
send a BYE to the target, and this would be based on learning the successful
completion of the triggered INVITE. I suppose the argument here is message
overhead and latency, once more. 

  


I think that covers it.

On the issue of method names - if this draft is accepted as a wg document I
would definitely want to change the method name. I'm with Pat on this one;
it will cause confusion.

there are several issues that arise out of NAT and socks 5 traversals and there have been several suggestions about overcoming them.

it is very important that we are able to traverse these proxies as most of the enterprises are behind them.

1. most of the schemes and papers submitted on the traversal issues have been suggestions to modify NAT and SOCKS behaviour to fit our shoe. i don't think that this is a workable approach. there are virtually hundreds of NAT and SOCKS implementations all over and if we are aiming at ubiquity, we need to comply with their existing architectures rather than suggesting some of our own. therefore, my suggestion will be to see if it is possible to make SIP work with the existing NAT, SOCKS 5 proxies as well as WinSock proxies.

2. a central problem to all proxy traversals (including that of NAT) is that we can never definitely know the UDP port associate opened by the proxy on behalf of a client behind the proxy server. therefore, the SIP protocol will have to work with an unknown UDP port.

3. The second issue is that RTP too will have to work in conjunction with SIP. therefore, the problem is to correctly identify the UDP port that to be specified in SDP for RTP (and for the purists, even the RTCP).

4. finally, not all clients behind a proxy will be able to open out the 5060 for themselves.

5. a clean approach to these problems is to write an application that co-hosts a state-ful proxy with an RTP relay, that uses the call states maintained within the SIP proxy to correctly route the RTP packets. This application sits on the same machine as the intranet proxy server.

the trouble with this approach is that your network admin has to be a fan of RFC2543 to agree to installing a SIP/RTP proxy that of all the horrors relays UDP packets for all (s)he cares.

6. The other option is to coax SIP itself to work with the current NAT/proxy architectures. Let me propose a scheme which is a little too bitter.

Recommendations:
a) SIP and RTP should be able to work from a single UDP port. By examining the SIP /RTP header, it should be possible to figure out which is which and accordingly process that datagram. this is a pretty radical thing. i am essentially saying the SIP should be able to work as an in-band signalling mechanism.
b)If the port and ip address in Contact does not match the actual IP and port address from which a UDP is received, then there should be mechanism of being able to repy back to the address/port from which the request came in.
c) The UDP port association may die within a minute, therefore, REGISTER has to be more frequent than 5 minutes.
d) In case of NAT, under this scheme, only out going calls will be possible. In order to accept incoming calls, clients behind NAT will have to work through a SIP/RTP proxy that is not necessarily locate on the Intranet.

The most important points to consider here are:
1. single port to be used for SIP and RTP, SIP and RTP streaming to be directed to the same address/port from where the original request/response was received. Thus, SIP should be able to indicate "use the port i am talking to you from" to the other side.
2. in case of using a proxy, the port association maybe different for different out-bound destinations, therfore, the media streaming too has to be proxied from the same port as where the SIP is being proxied.

(a) When a proxy computes the cryptographic hash of
From, To, Call-ID, CSeq.seqnum and Request-URI,
can it use the unparsed From and To or normalized
form of their parsed components. 
Does the loop detection scheme in the bis-02
version assumes that From header of a looped 
request or a spiralled request is byte-by-byte
same as the From header of the original incoming
request ? (Same question for To header)


(b) When using the To header, should the proxy include
the To tag in the hash computation ? If it did, then
ACK will map to a different transaction than the 
corresponding INVITE ??

Comments ??

Thanks,
Shail

you can't put this in the 200, because the SUBSCRIBE might be forked, and
only one of the 200s will get back.

POP or IMAP.  getting this via NOTIFY is not practical.

I would say that, in general, byte-by-byte is far too
fragile.  Some sort of normalised form sounds like a
good way to go.

Indeed.  I would just go on the To's URI.

Hi,

I guess I did not make my 2nd question clear. If we look at the NOTIFY
message A5 on Page 5, we may find out that the 3rd section and 4th section
of the NOTIFY message contain some information (such as message subject,
date/time, priority, etc) about the new voicemail messages. However, the
NOTIFY message for re-synchronization (for example A3) does not contain that
information. So, my question is: if a UA loses its previous data for some
reason and restart again, how can the UA retrieve that information (message
subject, date/time, priority, etc) from the Notifier?

Thanks,

-Kevin

Jo, I tend to think that doing URL match for addr-spec of
From/To headers and concatenating normalized
URL components even for hash computation,
is an unnecessary overhead. Practically speaking,
every proxy/ua will save the unparsed form
of From/To as it came in the first time (or
as it sent out the first time) and could do a 
simple string match on the addr-spec. (I thought
URLs cannot have white spaces ??)
I don't find the URL matching rules very useful
for the addr-spec of From and To headers, but
would be forced to use them.

I think this is a good proposal.

I would suggest that the overlap capability is offered in the INVITE and
accepted in the response from the UAS. Otherwise we get problems (e.g. user
on standard SIP client dials under-length number by mistake, PSTN gateway
sends IAM and returns response to UAC, but now the PSTN is waiting for more
digits so we do not get failure until something times out.)

I think the idea of including the number of digits to send in a reponse was
not that the UAS would know the total number of digits needed, but that it
might know 'I need at least 3 more digits to route this'. If it signalled
this information back, the UAC could wait 'till it had got 3 more digits and
we would save two messages, that's all.

<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think this is a good proposal.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I would suggest that the overlap capability is =
offered in the INVITE and accepted in the response from the UAS. =
Otherwise we get problems (e.g. user on standard SIP client dials =
under-length number by mistake, PSTN gateway sends IAM and returns =
response to UAC, but now the PSTN is waiting for more digits so we do =
not get failure until something times out.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think the idea of including the number of digits to =
send in a reponse was not that the UAS would know the total number of =
digits needed, but that it might know 'I need at least 3 more digits to =
route this'. If it signalled this information back, the UAC could wait =
'till it had got 3 more digits and we would save two messages, that's =
all.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Hi,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I had a look through the thread, and I still =
have one issue.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I do NOT think that we can assume that the PSTN =
GW will know how many</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits are needed to route a call to the PSTN =
end-user, so I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; don't think</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; we can use provisional responses to =
&quot;ask&quot; for more digits. Yes, the GW</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; may know how many digits it needs to route the =
call to the next PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; switch, but it doesn't know how many digits =
that switch needes, etc...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; So, my proposal would be:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 1. When the INVITE has been routed to the GW =
UAS, the only </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; response sent</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; back is 100. That would, of course, assume that =
we have to add Contact</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and/or Record-Route headers in the 100 =
response...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 2. Then, the UAC would use INFO to send more =
digits to the UAC, which</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; would forward them as SAMs. No, the GW would =
not &quot;ask&quot; for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; more digits,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; but does it really have to? If the UAC wants to =
send more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits, it can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; do so anyway, so...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 3. THEN, when the GW receives ACM from the PSTN =
side, it would send a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 18x provisional response back to the UAC. The =
UAC would now </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; know that no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; more digits are needed to route the call. Of =
course, we can get a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;please enter your code&quot;-message, and =
be asked to provide digits, but</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that is another issue.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; We should remember that the GW SIP UAS may not =
even know that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the UAC is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; sending more digits, because it may send them =
in encapsulated ISUP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; messages. In that case, however, the GW SIP UAS =
will not know </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it's SAMs,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; so it couldn't make a decission on if to send =
186 &quot;Gimme more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits&quot; or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; not...</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [PTT]</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed, and that is a nasty =
point.&nbsp; It's related to the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; next one.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Even if it the UAS GW =
would send an encapsulated ACM, it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not sure</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the UAC GW supports =
ISUP transparency in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; first place. It may</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support only ISUP/SIP =
mapping, for example.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [PTT]</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That one is easily solved, in =
two ways.&nbsp; First, by </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; hypothesis the UAC GW has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encapsulated the IAM in the =
initial INVITE.&nbsp; It can </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; also include an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Accept-Content: header.&nbsp; In =
fact, this is essential so </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that the two ends can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; negotiate stuff like ISUP =
version or the fact that one </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of them really wants</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to propagate Q.931.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, given that the UAS GW has =
received an encapsulated IAM, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Accept-Content: header indicates =
that it did or did not find the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encapsulated content =
acceptable.&nbsp; If it did find it </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; acceptable, how do we</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oblige it to keep up its end of =
the conversation?&nbsp; I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; expect the behaviour</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has to be specified in the SIP-T =
umbrella document, and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIP/GSTN gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; products have to indicate their =
conformity to that document.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that part of the =
problem, which is not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; related only to overlap</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dialling, is that a =
SIP/PSTN GW from a SIP point of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; view is an SIP UA,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from a SIP point of =
view should act like an SIP UA. Maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it should</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be considered as a SIP node =
of its own, with GW </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; specific functional</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirements. The only =
thing we have now is how to map</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between ISUP and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIP, but that is obviously =
not enough. ???</FONT>

I hope we aren't burdening the spec to cover all cases. In the case of two 
trunking gateway/softswitch complexes setting up a call between each other, 
I don't think we need too worry too much about their capabilities. Each 
complex will have all the local understanding they need.

There are other reasons for overlap which are not to do with outpulsing
delay/CAS interworking, but rather to do with determining end of dialling.

1) Support of open dial-plans, where not even the terminating exchange knows
how many digits to expect, only the user equipment knows this
2) Simplification of routing data, so not all exchanges have to know the
global dial-plan in order to work out how many digits to expect

In the absence of an indication of end-of-dialling from the calling user you
have only two choices:
a) Run an inter-digit timer and assume end of dialling if it expires
b) Overlap digits through the network towards a point where the end of
dialling can be determined from dial-plan knowledge

It is generally felt that for networks puporting to offer PSTN or better
services, (a) is not acceptable as it adds post-dial delay and can
mis-identify end of dialling if the user is too slow.

Of course an end-of-dialling indication from the user is highly desirable,
which is why all systems more advanced than simple telephony are based on
this (mobile phones, ISDN, SIP), but systems exist, and will continue to
exist for many decades, which do not provide this.

I believe there are important flaws in the mechanisms in the RFC and isup
mapping draft. Not least the requirements to have multiple outstanding call
legs for each extra digit, to use a whole INVITE for a single digit and to
tie these into a single call instance on the ISUP side of a gateway could
not be described as elegant.

We seem to be near reasonable solution based on negotiating the use of INFOs
- I think we should go ahead and document this so that we can bottom out the
details.

Keith,

I had the same response as Flemming. The idea is that if information is
received from an untrusted source, the proxy sets rpi-screen to 'yes' for
the identities that it can verify to be correct and 'no' for those that it
can't. For identities received from a trusted source, the rpi-screen values
are maintained as received (though it could change some 'no's to 'yes's if
it can do the verification.

I guess your comment is whether we should be able to include two identities
both claiming to be of the same type and for the same party but with
different rpi-screen values. I think this would be a good idea as I don't
think we should be placing any unnecessary restrictions/dependencies in the
syntax at this point, as long as the semantics are clear.

...Mark

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I had the same response as Flemming. The idea is that =
if information is received from an untrusted source, the proxy sets =
rpi-screen to 'yes' for the identities that it can verify to be correct =
and 'no' for those that it can't. For identities received from a =
trusted source, the rpi-screen values are maintained as received =
(though it could change some 'no's to 'yes's if it can do the =
verification.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I guess your comment is whether we should be able to =
include two identities both claiming to be of the same type and for the =
same party but with different rpi-screen values. I think this would be =
a good idea as I don't think we should be placing any unnecessary =
restrictions/dependencies in the syntax at this point, as long as the =

Except for all the embedded SIP devices which seem to have decided that they
don't need to support IP fragmentation.  This has been a significant
interoperability problem at bakeoffs.

Needless to say, I think this is something that SIP implementors should
beaware of, and fix before considering their embedded devices
production-quality.  I also think that we ought to add a torture test case
where crucial information in the SIP request sits after the 1500 byte mark.

Cc'd to sip-implementors; followups should go there.

You are correct about using some other means of transport if ISUP
trans-shipment is all your network is doing.  If the call destination (to a
SIP endpoint, to an H.323 endpoint, to a PSTN endpoint) varies on a per-call
basis, however, using SIP to establish your call routing leads to using SIP
to carry the ISUP.

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>You are correct about using some other means of =
transport if ISUP trans-shipment is all your network is doing.&nbsp; If =
the call destination (to a SIP endpoint, to an H.323 endpoint, to a =
PSTN endpoint) varies on a per-call basis, however, using SIP to =
establish your call routing leads to using SIP to carry the =
ISUP.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Hi Tom,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Still I want to have full state in every SIP =
message. If the call is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; addresed to the phone number 1234, I want to =
have a to field that says</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 1234. I do not care if there is a leg routed =
thru the PSTN and another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; thru SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Carrying full state is one of the beauties of =
SIP. If we begin using</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INFO for this, it would be the same as using =
SAMs. Differen names, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; same thing... I do not want to re-create ISUP =
using SIP. I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; believe that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; if the session has a destination, it should be =
present in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to field.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Again, if a proxy is providing services for =
this particular call, it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; will want to see the called party number in =
order to trigger </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the proper</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; service. This is a very good reason for =
updating the to field </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; every time</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; we have more digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I like to use SIP between two gateways because =
it is possible </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIP services for a PSTN to PSTN call. If all we =
want to do is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; finding a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; egrees gateway, we would probably want to use =
other protocols (TRIP &amp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIGTRAN for instance).</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not agree with these two =
statements:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 1st INVITE (with just some =
digits) arrives to a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; vanilla SIP UA.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will return a Not Found or a 484 =
Address incomplete. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying more digits will be =
discarded. Thus, the PSTN to SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will have to re issue a new INVITE =
with all the digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; better to begin directly using =
er-INVITEs rather than INFO.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, I do not think that SIP is =
just a transport protocol that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; carries ISUP messages between two =
gateways. For that, we have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; already</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIGTRAN. SIP might be used to provide =
services, even when the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; call is a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; PSTN-SIP-PSTN call. Thus, SIP =
messages MUST carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; state. And a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIP message with an incomplete to =
field does not carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; state.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; What if my SIP proxy provides a =
service for a PSTN-SIP-PSTN call</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the to field (called party =
number). That proxy would </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; like to see</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; updated to field, not just a to field =
that contains just some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digits.</FONT>

Is there anyway to get _one_ digest for the day.  I think so far today I
have received about 5 different digests.  Please excuse my lack of knowledge
regarding digested mailings.

Thanks,
Jeff

The spec contains several examples containing more than one media. If
you ignore things that don't belong in signaling protocols (such as
floor control), SIP will work just fine for any number of media. There
are a (small, unfortunately) number of user agents that support things
other than audio, but I've seen user agents supporting video, games,
text chat, shared whiteboards and shared applications, this being a
matter of adding the appropriate line to SDP, not of modifying SIP.

Thus, the lack of activity simply reflects the fact that there doesn't
seem to be anything special that is left to be done here.

This probably qualifies as a FAQ...

Hello and greetings!

Hopefully, this message is not directed at the wrong mailing list!

As I understand it, SIP is a stateless protocol. If all the messages from
a call flow are available to me from a set of log files that are ordered,
would it be possible to deduce the call flow (i.e. causal sequences of
messages) from just looking at the message logs (with no additional
information than the SIP Messages themselves) or is further information
required?


Thanks in advance for your answers.

Regards

Ranga.

> a) SIP and RTP should be able to work from a single UDP port.

This basic idea can work -- sooner or later I hope to write up
a SIP B2BUA I've implemented for multi-party conference 
initialization that takes this route, mostly following the
"Activision" techniques described in the recent "Protocol
Complications with NAT" RFC. The ugliest aspect of this is
that unless you also want to multiplex RTP and RTCP on the
same UDP port, you need to have parallel SIP sessions going
on two ports, on for the RTP port and one for the RTCP port.
In my SDP-specific implementation for the B2BUA, the NAT
information specified in the Activision algorithm gets 
embedded in SDP fmt lines by the SIP conference server,
which is another ugly aspect ... although I believe that
if the received tag for Via was a hostport, you might be able
to legally embed this NAT information in the SIP itself.

However, I think there's a big difference between "it can
be made to work" and "everyone should do it" -- using the
OS to do multiplexing is a pretty key concept in ALF, and
when you ignore it all sorts of bad things result.
One that immediately comes to mind -- you can't connect()
the socket on the client if you're using the Activision
algorithm in the multi-party case, since you're using the
same socket to send RTP to several parties, as well as 
the SIP conference B2BUA. The result is, you can't get
ICMP feedback to tell if you're UDP packets aren't being
listened to, and need to use timeouts exclusively ...

All solutions for nat and firewall traversal that assume no enterprise
support are ugly. I have proposed one solution:

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-entfw-00.txt

which relies on a B2BUA outside of the firewall, coupled with SIP over TLS.

Dear all,

Sorry for continuing this topic on this mailing list, but I would like to
confirm one point, which may relate to SIP protocol development.

I understand that SIP over transport protocols using IP has no limit, thanks
to the IP fragmentation function.
So, SIP has no need to worry about message length if it uses IP based
transport protocols, but should use TCP if it wants to send longer message
than the path MTU.
I also understand that supporting IP fragmentation is implementation issue.

On the other hand, SIP cannot send too long message over a transport
protocol that has no fragmentation function, such as MTP or signalling AAL.
However, nobody except me considers that SIP uses such transport protocol at
this stage, and therefore, this is not a problem.  In other word, it is only
a future possible problem.
If we will use such transport protocols, SIP will have to care about message
length and specify something (handling of over length message, or message
segmentation procedures in SIP level).

Is my understanding correct?

Regards,
Takumi Ohba

I think the correct answer about which approach to use (INFO vs. multiple
call legs) depends on your view of the scope of the address within the sip
cloud. If you believe that the sip role has ended once you have enough
digits to select an egress gateway (which may be as few as one, i.e., +1
selects a US gateway), then the sip address of that gateway can be viewed as
sip:+1@provider.com, and all subsequent digits are PSTN issues, outside the
scope of SIP. If you believe that the sip role encompasses functions that
might apply to the PSTN subscribers, then you need to have the entire
number, and the multiple call leg approach is the right way to go.

The multiple call leg approach is clearly ugly and inelegant, but it has the
nice property of completely masking the existence of overlap from proxies
and app servers within the network, allowing them to provide services in the
normal way.

You are correct about using some other means of transport if ISUP
trans-shipment is all your network is doing.  If the call destination (to a
SIP endpoint, to an H.323 endpoint, to a PSTN endpoint) varies on a per-call
basis, however, using SIP to establish your call routing leads to using SIP
to carry the ISUP.

The reason it was there is that if the proxy DOES want to follow it, it
becomes meaningless to have some URLS with redirect, and some with proxy.
What does the proxy do? Does it mean to redirect if the highest q value URL
has an action of redirect, even though others say proxy? What if the q
values are the same, or none were specified? We came to the conclusion that
it could mean any number of more complex behaviors, most of which were more
appropriately specified via a CPL than action params.

So, I would like to keep this restriction.

Yes. The issue has been raised on the list at least three separate times.
Please check the archives.

My view is the same it was the other three times. Failover and redundancy
for devices contacted by clients is best handled by using things like SRV
records. The SRV record for some registrar would contain a list of ordered
devices to try. When you want to service the main one, you take it out of
service. Clients who re-register will get an ICMP error, and as per
draft-ietf-sip-srv, will then try the next address, which is its backup.

This works not only for registrations, but for outbound proxies, and any
other sip communications, even between servers and servers. SRV is not ideal
for all load balancing and failover needs, as is well known, but I think it
addresses this need perfectly well.

I am not asking that Proxy/Registrars be forbidden from
responding 
409 just that they be free to choose not to. Presently a
registrar 
MUST respond 409 to conflicting action params. I don't want to 
be forced to respond 409 when somebody has their mailto URL
registered 
with an redirect action and then wants to add a SIP URL which 
they want requests proxied to.

This is a fair point but we could define how a server
should respond to mixed action params wrt q values if that
is perceived to be an issue. I think that generally CPL will be 
available to provide this sort of control where it is really 
needed and so the whole existence of an action param is fairly 
unintersting. If present can't it just be treated more as a hint. 
A SIP server could then choose to try and follow them, use it's 
own configuration policy or follow alternative user defined 
processing logic (CPL etc). This gives more flexibility than 
mandating 409s.

Cheers,
Neil.

it is unreasonable to resyncronize this information with NOTIFY, so the
client must use POP or IMAP to get the current contents of the mailbox.

I'm not advocating destroying the response code, just
allowing using it to be policy at the registrar.

The classic proxy you mention would choose to use a
registar that by policy returned 409.

The current MUST restriction prevents applications
that _can_ deal with multiple action types from using
a "compliant" registrar.

Further, with the current wording, I can't ask a
proxy to proxy MESSAGEs and redirect INVITES, which
is a very reasonable thing to ask a classic proxy to
do.

Bill, all,

I think that independently of the 3rd party Call Control cases, there are
still two open issues with the manyfolks draft even for a simple two-party
case.

1) Whilst it is possible for A to require that a COMET be set in the B --> A
direction, and for B to require that a COMET be sent in the A --> B
direction, it is not possible for A to require that B awaits the A --> B
COMET or for B to require that A awaits the B --> A COMET.

If, say, A is responsible for resource reservation in both directions (send
and recv), it is quite likely that A will require B to await the A->B COMET
before alerting the user. We shouldn't be making assumptions about who is
responsible for the resource reservation - it depends on the technology
being used in the network.

2) The draft only covers pre-conditions associated with a particular media
stream - the qos is a media attribute. So, if the UA does not choose to
support that media stream, it does not wait for the COMET. I believe we
could easily extend to cope with pre-conditions which are not related to a
particular media path between the UAs (e.g. completion of some dialogue with
another network on the other side of the SIP UA.) This could be achieved by
allowing the qos attribute to appear as a session attribute.

Would like to propose to add a new diversion reason code - "number mapping."
The new code can be used, for example, when a redirect server performs a
number mapping from a freephone number to a POTS number and returns the POTS
number in the Contact hearder of a 302 response.  The two numbers/addresses
are "related."

There is a need to at least describe in texts (if not to be shown in the
call flows) about the recursing proxy sending CANCEL for any pending INVITE
downstream, receiving 200 OK (CANCEL), receiving a 487 response and
returning an ACK for several examples.  

The procedures at the the recursing proxy need to specify that the recursing
proxy must not forward the 487 response upstream.

The 3xx/4xx in many example should be Acked.

It is not clear why "time-of-day" is needed unless the night service needs
to use multiple reason codes for proper call processing.  A reason code such
as "unavailable"  or even "uncondicational" (set after busy hours by the
shops) seems to be sufficient.

Actually (because of one of our company businesses Voice and Video
Conferencing) we looked closer to how SIP can be used for real life
multimedia applications. I would say, there are still some obstacles on the
way before quality SIP/SDP based multimedia service will be delivered beyond
lab environment. And I am NOT talking about advanced features that hopefully
SDPng and some Floor Control protocol would provide. (BTW I support SDPng
work very much.)
As a first step towards "SIP for Video" I will submit a Draft for the
upcoming IETF meeting presenting these requirements. I would be glad to know
how much interest exists to work on this topic from the floor.

Subject: Re: [SIP] Video Conferencing?

The spec contains several examples containing more than one media. If
you ignore things that don't belong in signaling protocols (such as
floor control), SIP will work just fine for any number of media. There
are a (small, unfortunately) number of user agents that support things
other than audio, but I've seen user agents supporting video, games,
text chat, shared whiteboards and shared applications, this being a
matter of adding the appropriate line to SDP, not of modifying SIP.

Thus, the lack of activity simply reflects the fact that there doesn't
seem to be anything special that is left to be done here.

This probably qualifies as a FAQ...

I would presume so; and further, you may be able to re-create the causal 
sequence of message flow based on the logs of only a UAC, UAS, or a R-R'ed 
proxy (as opposed to the logs of a UAC AND a UAS).

I scanned through the bis draft and it wasn't
immediately obvious to me whether you can embed
SIP headers in a MIME attachement. Specifically, I
was wondering whether it would be legit to embed
SIP headers and potentially recursively adding
MIME multipart into a SMIME attachement. Allowing
this would provide an arguably more standards
track way of transporting secure end to end SIP
headers in proxy routed messages. Even if you
prefer the existing PGP mechanism, it would seem
cleaner to place the PGP signed part into a MIME
attachement so that we can relax some of the weird
rules that I'm guessing are mainly an artifact of
MIME not being baked enough in that part of SIP's
evolution.

I was thinking that we would have a PSAP CA, the root certificate of which
could easily be stored in the UA (or proxy servers).  Then anyone could
validate easily that the other end was a PSAP.

I definitively agree that this is the view that INFO fans have of a SIP
cloud. What I am saying is that this view is wrong. This usage of SIP
falls outside the scope of SIP.

If they want to use SIP for locating a gateway,  it is fine. But after
the gateway has been located, let's use another method for transporting
ISUP signalling.

Let's assume that I get an IAM with "+1", as Jonathan says in his
example. Then the INVITE generated by the gateway will reach the US
gateway. Now, the mission of SIP has finished, since the gateway has
been located. Why don't we put in the body of this INVITE a session
description that comprises a media session and a SIGTRAN session? This
way we would have established these two sessions between the gateways
and all the subsequent ISUP messages would be sent over the SIGTRAN
session.

I find that the usage of SIP that I have just described would be OK.
What I do not understand is why folks want to use SIP for transporting
subsequent ISUP messages. SIP does not have good transport properties
(big overhead, it can run over UDP...). Besides, it does not provide
ordered delivery.

If the INVITE has Cseq=1 and the next message that the egrees gateway
receives is a INFO with Cseq=7... what should the gateway do? Maybe
there were several proxies in the middle asking for credentials for the
INFO, so the ingrees gateway had to add authentication stuff and resend
the INFO. If this was the case, the SAM contained in the INFO would be
the second digit of the called party number... However, maybe 5 INFO
messages got lost, and the SAM that we have received in the body of the
INFO makes no sense without the previous ones because is the 7th digit
of the number... 

This is not usually a problem in SIP, since all messages have full
state. However, using INFO for sending SAMs breaks this rule, and
therefore it breaks the SIP model.

I believe that considering that the session is established after the
first INVITE and sending the following SAMs using INFO is making one of
the mistakes described in the guidelines for SIP authors: "We need to
transport ISUP signalling over IP between two gateways. Both gateways
already implement SIP... why do we have to implement another protocol?
Let's use SIP to transport ISUP signalling". We are just trying to use
SIP for this just because it would save implementing yet another
protocol in the gateways.

I strongly disagree with this usage of SIP. SIP-T is good as long as the
SIP cloud provides services. If not, SIP-T is not a good protocol for
transporting ISUP signalling.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

There are a couple of questions to be posed here, in my mind.

Do we develop firewalls to provide "transparent" end to end communications
or do we develop protocols to support firewalls?

Creating application level gateways to facilitate the "transparent"
functionality is a common task that vendors typically perform to increase
the functionality as well as the value of the product.

Creating protocols to support firewalls is worse than a hasty work-around,
IMHO.

NAT and SOCKS wsa developed to support the enterprise in a secure manner and
to provide functional translation when necessary. The very functions they
provide lend themselves for modification, in combination with application
level gateways.

We can and do knowthe listening port, as well as the source IP address of
the client. Typically, when dealing with RTP firewalls ALG's are created
aware of the associated RTCP requirements.

see above. as for RTCP it is always the next highest odd port number, thus
ther is no need to identify rather pinhole accordingly.

This can be defined. Typically if the call is established from within it is
allowed access out by the firewall, if configured to do this.

I believe that if SIP functinality is being considered it is most likely out
of the hands of the administrator to decide if they are a fan of SIP or not.

This is where I get heartburn. The first and foremost job of a firewall is
to provide a "transparent" end-to-end solution without disrupting the
functionality of the Internet Protocols traversing it. It is setup to
provide protection and accountability, to not re-write of IP protocols.

This would require even more processing by the firewall, because without
parsing the packet just about anything could be entering the network, now we
would be building a method of circumventing security policies through
friewalls. By combining the two protocols we would be developing a stronger
vulnerability for DoS type attacks.

This would actually be a good idea for the RTP packets, something that my
associate brought up the other day. If the clients were set up to send and
receive on the same port it could simplify the access permissions on the
firewall.

This may not be necessary due to the fact that, depending on the NAT method
used, internal clients may be assigned unique "listening" ports on the
outside, or split DNS may be implemented. There are several methods that
could be looked into closely on this point.

This is a solution that may have possibilities as an alternative solution, I
believe that there is a draft that describes something similiar to this SIP
scenario, in combination with MGCP,

Indeed, it was agreed at the last meeting (at least, agreed upon by those at
the bar bof), that it would be wise to deprecate the PGP stuff (and, as a
result, the canonicalization rules), in favor of S/MIME or PGP/MIME. The
implication of this is that we will need to define a mime type of
message/sip so that the signed message can be carried in a part of the  SIP
message:


INVITE sip:jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com SIP/2.0
To: sip:user@host
From: sip:caller@host
Content-Type: multipart/related
Boundary: ---

---
Content-Type: message/sip

To: sip:user@host
From: sip:caller@host
Content-Type: application/sdp

<sdp>
---
Content-Type: application/sdp

<sdp>

---
Content-Type: signature (whatever the type is for it)

sad08asdohasdojnasd08sdnoasdaosd09




Its big, but thats S/MIME.

This includes development of extensions, and improvements in the baseline
sip spec for advancement towards draft standards. The sip-implementors list
is meant for QUESTIONS on sip, requests for information, and the like. 

I expect that despite our efforts, newbies will continue to post questions
on the main sip list. I would strongly encourage our body of experts who
answer these questions to NOT answer them on the main sip list. Send your
response to the person and to sip-implementors. Otherwise, the thread will
not migrate. 

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

It is not that simple. If you allow proxies to accept these kinds of things,
that means you allow clients to send them. Once you do that, you must define
concrete processing rules associated with registrations of this type.
Otherwise, a UA now has no way of knowing the
processing a proxy will apply to a set of registered Contacts, or worse,
what the
behavior they're requesting actually is.

As an example, a UA believes it wants a service whereby the proxy server
forwards the request to A, and if it fails, redirects to B. So, it registers
a contact URL with proxy action as high q value, and a separate contact as
redirect action as a lower proxy. It assumes that a proxy server will do
this service as a result. THe proxy might accept this, and provide this
interpretation, or it might accept it, and provide a different
interpretation, or it might reject it. If it rejects it, what does the
client do then? Must it alert the user to redefine the parameters? I
wouldn't want to handle this customer service call.

However, as defined now, the meaning of a set of registered contacts is
CLEAR. If you want more complex behaviors, you send a CPL (and indeed, the
above service is readily representable in a clear and unambigous way using
CPL). By removing this restriction, and as a consequence, allowing clients
to send all kinds of weird stuff, the end result will not be what users
expect.

This particular problem can also be solved by a somewhat smarter mixer.
Rather than acting as a pure mixer as defined in rfc1889, it generates RTCP
SDES items for all people that have joined the conference at the sip level,
but have not sent RTCP SDES on their own. It can construct the name, to some
reasonable level, from the From field of the INVITE used to join the
conference.

An even smarter mixer might ignore the RTCP SDES sent from the users
entirely, and rather, generate the RTCP SDES using the identity obtained
from any SIP authorization/authentication process used to verify identity
when the user join the conference in the first place.

Since RTP (and RTCP) can be encrypted, you can also get privacy of this data
by encrypting it. This way, only conference participants know the list of
people in a conference; an eavesdropper cannot determine it.

So, I think you can get adequate security features.

If people think this idea is not too much of a hack, I will gladly add it to
the conferencing models draft.

SUB/NOT could work, as we discussed in the interim meeting today. However, I
still maintain that there is a lot of other things you might want here, and
they are part of a broader conference control protocol, for which one
component is notifications of lists of subscribers. Rather than have a SIP
mechanism for SUB/NOT for the subscriber list, and a SEPARATE protocol for
managing those subscribers (consider the case where I get notified that a
user joined, and then I want to mute them. Its a bit harder as this
operation now spans two separate protocols; there may be issues with that),
I'd rather specify out a conference control protocol that does everything.

Indeed, it is fine. Here is a proof, in fact.

Consider that the proxy forks, gets a 4xx and a 5xx. Then, it forks once
more, but to itself. WHen it receives this fork, it responds with a 3xx.
Now, the best response is 3xx, which it may forward upstream.

What a proxy should not do, is generate a response when there are pending
proxied branches outstanding. If it does this, one of those pending branches
may respond with a 200 OK, but you've already sent some other non-2xx
upstream. Thats bad. This is why you REALLy want to have a UAS that responds
to a cancelled INVITE with a 487; it guarantees that the proxy gets final
responses before forwarding one upstream.

Seems prejudicial in favor of SIP catering to BICC. If we do this, what
about:

SIP-BICC-SIP

I think we should request the BICC guys to be able to encapsulate SIP
messages. After all, what about service transparency across my SIP network!
All these operators that are deploying SIP are doing so, in part, because of
the service possibilities. Shall I be forced to lose those capabilities when
I traverse an IP based BICC network? Why do the BICC guys get to keep their
services, and the SIP guys don't? After all, BICC is even newer than SIP.

Of course, once we do that, the more fun case is:

ISUP-SIP-BICC-SIP-ISUP

in which case the encapsulated SIP messages themselves contain ISUP
messages, both of which are encapsulated in BICC.

Of course, we should probably also consider the case of:

SIP-ISUP-SIP

Think about it; a SIP phone calls a PSTN number. It goes to an ss7 gateway.
Turns out, that this number is then forwarded to another number, and that
number is a VoIP terminal. So, it exits at another gateway, and hits the
terminal. I suppose we should also request the ISUP guys to encapsulate SIP
messages. 

Now then, we should also probably consider the case of:

SIP-BICC-SIP-ISUP-SIP-BICC

I actually don't think SIP REGISTER is appropriate here. THe reason is that
this problem is much broader than SIP.

As a general issue, the devices which come into being in one of these
piconets will have many services associated with URLS - ftp services, web
services, IM services, sip services, and so on. Normally, these service URLs
are published through out-of-bands means, like on a business card or from a
directory service. What you need here is a way to construct dynamic,
distributed directory services that allow you access to the resources on the
network as they are introduced.

In fact, the argument could be made that the right solution is actually a
Directory Agent-less SLP network. When a device joins the piconet, it
creates service agents that advertise the services on the device - the sip
URL, for example, along with the parameters of that service (the name of the
user, their codecs, and so on). By doing this with a service independent
mechanism, it works for lots of things besides SIP.

Jonathan,
I believe that workarounds for firewall inadequacies is no better than
removing the firewall.

The issue of trust compounds the already insecure nature of SIP without
adding a possible avenue of attack from an untrusted public source, through
the use of SSL or TLS. by at least creating the functionality at or on the
firewall one could at least have a fighting chance.

Also as we know vulnerabilities exist, but also can be created by unsound
architectures. Already SSL has been determined to be flawed in a lab
environment, causing a systme vulnerability that may allow access to the
server running it. TLS is supposed to fix alot of the downside to SSL, as
well as become the standards based form of SSL, but does it also have the
vulnerability?

In the draft you state

"The other alternative, embedding a SIP ALG within enterprise NATs and
firewalls, has not happened. The top commercial firewall and NAT products
continue to be SIP-unaware. Even if SIP ALG support were added immediately,
there is still a huge installed based of firewalls and NATs that do not
understand SIP."

As an assumption on my part I would like to go out on a limb and state that
just as SIP is evolving, and growing in support, so will the firewall
vendors in implementing the solution.

I also believe that if an enterprise has made the decision to implement SIP,
whether to save money or take advantage of the new functionality offered at
such a scale, they have already signaled that they are willing to do what it
takes to support SIP.

If the existing firewall technology cannot accomodate the business
requirement to implement SIP, the enterprise will most likely find a vendor
that can.

As we know a couple of vendors have already begun to support SIP
functionality, and others are following suit.

But I've rambled my personal agenda long enough, on to the task at hand.
Lets make the standards based methodology needed to propagate SIP to the
world through NAT, short lived though it may be. :^)

Early media is being discussed right now, so things might change. Right
now, 183 with no SDP does not imply playing any announcement to the user
other than "Session in progress".

It is not elegant, but it is the best mechanism (or less bad than the
others, if you want).

Do not think so. As I said several times, if you want the SIP network to
provide services, you have to go for multiple call legs. If you just
want to transport signalling, SIP is a very bad protocol for that
purpose. Use another.

Using INFO for sending SAMs is trying to re-create the ISDN call model
using SIP. I just do not like the whole idea.

It is not defined because it does not need to be defined. Different
implementations will do different things. The RFC does not and MUST NOT
cover those situations.

For example, if I have multiple call legs in a gaming session, should
the RFC define what to do? In a conferencing environment the correct
behavior might be just to mix the media.

Anyway, a gateway will know what to do with multiple call legs that
carry more digits in the to field. If the entity receiving the INVITEs
is a UA it will not represent a problem either. The UA will process the
first INVITE and answer 484 or 404. Then, it will receive the 2nd and
try to process it. If there are nor enought digits, it will respond
again 484 or 404. If there are enough digits, the call will be
established. Thus, I do not see any problem here.


> 2) The UAC must use source routing to ensure that all these INVITES

What is the problem here? This is done in order to address the problem
of proxies performing load balancing. Some folks have pointed out that
maybe the betwork wants to route the second INVITE in a different way...
why the network would like to do that? The policy that is applicable to
the fist INVITE (that contained a prefix of the number) should be the
same that applies to the subsequent ones.

I do not think that the network wants that all the calls to numbers
begining by +1234 traverse proxy A, but if the prefix is +12345 should
traverse proxy B.

I do not see any real situation where the source routing performed here
might cause a problem.

I said already that this will be clarified in the draft. However, this
has to do with the early media issue also.

Let me get this straight. Are you are proposing to change the logic in
all the already existing proxies because you want to provide services
when you use INFO for carrying SAMs? This is just impossible.

I still prefer a mechanism that do not require changes in the existing
proxies (multiple call-legs).

Gonzalo

I answer to this in my previous mail. I do not think that the proxy is
going to apply a different policy (proxies that the request will
traverse) when more digits are received.
If an INVITE to +1234 has to go thru proxy A, another INVITE to +12345
will have to traverse proxy A also. Thus, the Route will not change from
one request to the other.

Anyway, if a network is not performing load balancing between gateways
it can ignore the record-route. Its only purpose is to avoid multiples
INVITEs to arrive to different egrees gateways. If this happended,
multiples IAM would be generated rather than a IAM and several SAMs.

Excantly. Thus, in this situation you would be using the multiple call
legs approach. That is a bid advantage. It works with gateways and with
vanilla SIP UAs. INFO does not.

I hope that the only SIP UAs that send digits in overlap mode are the
gateways towards the PSTN.

Yes, I will do it.

Gonzalo,

So I guess we need either a new response code, a special formulated 183 for (local) early media or else. Hope to see a general consensus.

If so hope to see the following statement be added in Section 7.1.5 of rfcbis2 (if it is not already there):
'183 with no SDP must (should ?) not play any announcement (early media) to the user.

Also 'no early media if 183 w/o SDP'  seems not exactly to be the same as 'no ACM if 183 w/o SDP'. But that is only my conjecture.

To some extent a mixer already has to generate its own RTCP messages,
either copying the RTCP from incoming streams or generate its own set,
so this is standard behavior for a mixer. If the conference server acts
as an RTP translator, i.e., simply replicates packets, it can do
something similar.

In many cases, for a central conference server, you really don't need
much more than that. We are controlling permissions and media
replication via a web interface in our server, which seems to work
pretty well.

The one advantage of SUB/NOT is that's easier to divorce media from such
notifications. For example, you can imagine long-running chat rooms
where I want to be notified whenever a certain person shows up (or
leaves, depending on my particular preferences). That's pretty natural
for the subscription model.

This fictitious protocol has been around for so long, that I'm somewhat
concerned to keep useful functionality from being deployed.

That is true, but that doesn't argue any more for not using REGISTER as
in a non-ad-hoc network. After all, we could also use SLP to locate
users in a regular network for SIP. SLP isn't particularly well suited
for locating persons, as it's mostly designed for parameterized
services. I'm sure you could modify it appropriately, but the REGISTER
approach seems pretty natural for the user-location model.

[First of all, I suggest any follow-up to go to the sip-events list!!!]


If I may rephrase Kevin's question, it is "what happens if I (the UA)
crashes after I've set up a SUBSCRIPTION?"  For example, the UA will receive
what are, in its view, unsolicited NOTIFY messages.  Alternately, the UA may
recognize that the NOTIFY messages belong to it, but it will have lost the
initial state.  Remember, the NOTIFY message only propagates updates (IMHO
the correct choice).

My response to the question: if the UA crashes, when it restarts it will
re-subscribe to the message presence server.  This subscription is an
initial subscription, so the UA will receive the entire state of the
mailbox.  See Section 5.3 of the draft.

[First of all, I suggest any follow-up to go to the sip-events list!!!]


Much better than the last version!

Conceptually, what we try to achieve with MWI is the _presence_ of messages
on the messaging server, much in the same way as we look for the _presence_
of people on an instant messaging system.  This philosophy doesn't change
anything in the draft, but including some sort of language to that effect
would make it more accessible to the reader.

On a behavioral level, I understand why the notification entity sends
message A13 in response to the unsubscribe request A11.  However, the UA
really doesn't want this information.  I was thinking of how to do an
unsubscribe, without either messing up the semantics of SUBSCRIBE or
creating a new method.

How about if the unsubscribe message A11 did NOT include the "Accept:
application/simple-message-summary" header.  Being a well-formed message,
the notifier would send a 200 OK and the session is finished.  This assumes
that "Expires: 0" in the new message A11.  I would put it in the spec that a
non-zero Expires time without an Accept header results in bizarre behavior.
Notification servers SHOULD reply with a 4xx (406?) response in this case.
Either way the session will be finished, as there's no reason for a
notification server to create a session to *not* send notifications.

Should this be part of sub/notify (S 5.1.5.3), or is it too odd?

This particular problem can also be solved by a somewhat smarter mixer.
Rather than acting as a pure mixer as defined in rfc1889, it generates RTCP
SDES items for all people that have joined the conference at the sip level,
but have not sent RTCP SDES on their own. It can construct the name, to some
reasonable level, from the From field of the INVITE used to join the
conference.

An even smarter mixer might ignore the RTCP SDES sent from the users
entirely, and rather, generate the RTCP SDES using the identity obtained
from any SIP authorization/authentication process used to verify identity
when the user join the conference in the first place.

Since RTP (and RTCP) can be encrypted, you can also get privacy of this data
by encrypting it. This way, only conference participants know the list of
people in a conference; an eavesdropper cannot determine it.

So, I think you can get adequate security features.

If people think this idea is not too much of a hack, I will gladly add it to
the conferencing models draft.

SUB/NOT could work, as we discussed in the interim meeting today. However, I
still maintain that there is a lot of other things you might want here, and
they are part of a broader conference control protocol, for which one
component is notifications of lists of subscribers. Rather than have a SIP
mechanism for SUB/NOT for the subscriber list, and a SEPARATE protocol for
managing those subscribers (consider the case where I get notified that a
user joined, and then I want to mute them. Its a bit harder as this
operation now spans two separate protocols; there may be issues with that),
I'd rather specify out a conference control protocol that does everything.

Sorry, but I still have some issues with this thread :) I mentioned it
earlier, but it was never discussed.

First, to comment the previous discusion, I do NOT want to "use SIP just
to transport ISUP". I never even assumed that ISUP transparency was used
(it has nothing to do with the ISUP-SIP draft) in the first place. For
the INFO proposal I assumed a specific header could be used...

However, let us leave the INFO proposal for a minute, and instead
discuss the problem with the current proposal (according to the ISUP-SIP
draft).

So, here is one issue:

Let's assume that GW B receives an INVITE, from GW A, with enough digits
to route (so, no 484 will be sent back). An IAM will be generated, and
the call setup will be routed to the next PSTN switch, switch C. Switch
C, however, DOES need more digits to be able to route the call. Switch
C, however, can not inform GW B about that, so no response, provisional
or final, other than a 100 automatically generated by GW B will be sent
back to GW A.

Now, we can assume that GW A, when it receives more digits, will
generate a new INVITE anyway, even if it didn't receive 484. So...

Issue 1: Since GW B already has established a call setup for the first
INVITE, and has also probably reserved PSTN resources etc for it.

Issue 2: Can we now require that GW B will be smart enough to compare
the digits in new INVITE with the ones in the old one, and generate the
SAMs needed?

Issue 3: To prevent issue 1 and 2, GW A could send a CANCEL for the
previous INVITE everytime it sends a new INVITE (if a 484 hasn't been
received before that). That would, however:

- Generate lots of extra SIP traffic, which is not good.

- Make the GW B process every new INVITE as a new call. That would make
the GW B first reserve PSTN resources, then unreserve them when the
CANCEL comes, reserve them again when the new INVITE comes etc etc etc.
That solution doesn't sound very good either, I think...


I also agree that operlap dialing will not be very widely used, but it
may be used in PSTN-SIP-PSTN cases, so...

Comments?

Hi,

I would like to clarify an issue with the session-timer - again related
to SIP/PSTN interworking.

The session-timer draft says:

"If the refreshing re-INVITE is used solely for refreshing, it MUST
still contain a session description, unchanged from the previous
INVITE. The session description MUST somehow indicate that it has not
changed. In the case of SDP, this is accomplished by including the
same value for the origin field as previous messages to its peer."

First, I assume that it is NOT allowed to send a new ISUP body in the
re-INVITE (INFO MUST be used for that, since it doesn't affect the SIP
part of the call). If it is allowed, I would not only have to compare
the SDP body to the original INVITE, but also the ISUP body - and any
other possible body...

Second, if the first assumption is correct, I wonder if it is possible
not to send the ISUP bodies in the re-INVITEs at all? The minus is that
parts of the keep-alive mechanism provided by the session-timer
dissapears, but the plus is that the refresh re-INVITE messages will be
smaller (the initial INVITE message may be pretty big, if it contains
both SDP and ISUP, and possible also other message body types...). I
guess one has to compare the number of smaller messages compared to how
many times the UAS will crash.

Comments?

Yes, so far this is correct.

Yes. In the normal case it has reserved a timeslot in a E1. This does
not have to change, since the arrival of more digits will not require
more resorces. The resources needed for the call are defined in the IAM.
The SAMs just add more digits to the called number. Nothing more.

The new INVITE has the same call-ID as the first one. Thus, everything
that the gateway has do to is sending a SAM with the new digits.

I do not think this is a complicated operation. Just parsing a SIP
message involves more complicated operations than this one.

Besides your points, this is a bad idea because if the CANCEL arrives
before the new INVITE, the result is that the egrees gateway sends a REL
and then a new IAM. This is what we want to avoid.

Actually this one was one of the first proposals for overlap signalling
(long time ago...).

Gonzalo

It may not be complicated, but maybe it should be pointed out somewhere.
However, a request may be forked, and a proxy may for some strange
reason change the whole Request-URI, so that two different INVITEs for
the same Call-ID is received, but I think it is an implementation issue
how the GW handles those kind of situations.

That is what I meant would happend, and it is not a good idea.

I couldn't agree more on that :)

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Extensions to the 'tel' and 'fax' URLs to Support 
                          Number Portability and Freephone Service
	Author(s)	: J. Yu
	Filename	: draft-yu-tel-url-02.txt
	Pages		: 12
	Date		: 09-Feb-01
	
This document proposes some extensions to the 'tel' and 'fax' Uniform 
Resource Locators (URLs) for supporting number portability (NP) and 
freephone service.  Those proposed extensions allow the Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP) to carry those URLs or to convert those 
URLs to the SIP URL so as to support NP and freephone service.  The 
proposed extensions allow the SIP protocol to be used to derive the 
routing number for the ported geographical numbers, identify the 
freephone service provider/carrier or the Plain Old Telephone Service 
(POTS) number for a freephone number, and carry the NP- and 
freephone-related information in the SIP messages.

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-yu-tel-url-02.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

All:

I needed some clarification on the usage of CSEQ with PRACK's. The draft
says that the CSEQ number in PRACK MUST be higher than the last transaction
CSEQ number (INVITE or otherwise). So, for example, say, an UAC sends out an
INVITE with CSEQ 1, it receives a 180 ringing, it issues a PRACK with CSEQ
2. 

The question I had is should these CSEQ's be preserved after the INVITE
transaction has ended? Meaning, in the above example, say the PRACK,
generates a 200 OK by the UAS for the same, followed by an ACK for the
INVITE(when the called party answers), the UAC issues an ACK with CSEQ 1
INVITE to complete the 3 way handshake. At a later point of time, say, the
user hungup, which causes the UAC to issue a BYE, should the CSEQ field be
constructed with a sequence number, higher than the last PRACK it sent
out(or received in case of far end disconnects) or the last INVITE it sent
out(or received)? Please elaborate.

Thanks.
Venkatesh

Hi,

I'm having difficulty in understanding the following from RFC2327, SDP.

     "When a list of payload formats is given, this implies that all of
     these formats may be used in the session, but the first of these
     formats is the default format for the session." -- SDP Standards Track,
page 20.

What does default mean here?

When a m-line reads as "m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 3 4 5", does this mean that
the remote UA will be requested to use GSM (PT 3) if it could support it and
if it didn't support GSM, the local UA will negotiate for G723 (PT 4) with
the remote UA and so on? (It's clear that I need to understand the above
phrase!).

Thanks for your help and valuable time.

Regards,

--victor

We are looking into collaboration technologies including video and the use of
SIP. I think SIP does not have to do much for handling video-conferencing
since SDP negotiation can simply have an added line describing the proper
codec to be used at either side. Then it goes to the actual media handler
where ports have to be opened and video to be handled. But there are some
other interesting issues that come up.
* In video-conferencing, I think there is no gateway involved. Because the
other end is most likely a IP host unlike VoIP where the terminating end could
be a dumb telephone. But could the other end be a TV set on a regular HFC
cable network that is not transporting IP over its reverse channels? Then the
Headend becomes a true gateway...opens up whole lot of issues.
* While 3-way calling and multi-party calling in voice has been handled, I
think the same analogies in the video-conferencing world have to be better
understood. What does it mean to bring another video source in to the
(multicast) session that is going on? Can a simple MCU handle all these video
mixing?
* QOS and bandwidth issues are probably stringent for video-conferencing.
* To promote SIP towards broader acceptance, everyone is trying to push for
new capabilities it brings to the table eg., web/telephony integration etc. I
really like the idea of thinking beyond current telephone handsets and
services we know of coming from the SS7 world. What about video services? We
have seen so far regular TV broadcast, pay-per-view, on-demand video and some
limited conferencing. Can anyone identify interesting video services along the
same lines as we have done in the  voice services world (which again
unfortunately many people do not use)?
* I think voice calls and pricing per minute have come up many times. Rate
arbitrage is an initial driver but not sustainable long term. What is the
pricing analogy for video services?

Hi,
I've been trying to find the answer in the RFC (2543) and also in past queries posted on
this mailing list - but couldn't quite get a clear answer. What I wish to find out is
what does a proxy server do, if it receives a request with a missing "Content-Length"
field?

Section 6.15 (pg.51) says that, "if a server receives a UDP request without
Content-Length, it MUST assume that the request encompasses the remainder of the packet";

Whereas, Section 7.4.12 (pg.79) says that, "The server refuses to accept the request
without a defined Content-Length" 

So, does this imply that if this field is missing in an incoming request, the server
returns a 411 (Length Required) response? Or, does it just assume to have no body and
process the request?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
nirmalya

The example Jonathan gives is for contacts for the same type of request.  As
Robert said, if I want my MESSAGEs to go to a different place than my
INVITEs, it should be allowed.

So, I propose (4 examples below):

REGISTER sip:registrarserver.com SIP/2.0
...
contact: sip:me@machineA.hotsip.com;action=proxy;method=MESSAGE
contact: sip:me@machineBhotsip.com;action=redirect;method=MESSAGE

Illegal.



REGISTER sip:registrarserver.com SIP/2.0
...
contact: sip:me@machineA.hotsip.com;action=proxy;method=MESSAGE
contact: sip:me@machineBhotsip.com;action=redirect;method=INVITE

Legal.



REGISTER sip:registrarserver.com SIP/2.0
...
contact: sip:me@machineA.hotsip.com;action=proxy
contact: sip:me@machineBhotsip.com;action=redirect

Illegal



REGISTER sip:registrarserver.com SIP/2.0
...
contact: sip:me@machineA.hotsip.com;action=proxy
contact: sip:me@machineBhotsip.com;action=redirect;method=MESSAGE

Not sure about this one.  Maybe illegal.

I propose this to be in the user preferences and not the base sip.

It is not that simple. If you allow proxies to accept these kinds of things,
that means you allow clients to send them. Once you do that, you must define
concrete processing rules associated with registrations of this type.
Otherwise, a UA now has no way of knowing the
processing a proxy will apply to a set of registered Contacts, or worse,
what the
behavior they're requesting actually is.

As an example, a UA believes it wants a service whereby the proxy server
forwards the request to A, and if it fails, redirects to B. So, it registers
a contact URL with proxy action as high q value, and a separate contact as
redirect action as a lower proxy. It assumes that a proxy server will do
this service as a result. THe proxy might accept this, and provide this
interpretation, or it might accept it, and provide a different
interpretation, or it might reject it. If it rejects it, what does the
client do then? Must it alert the user to redefine the parameters? I
wouldn't want to handle this customer service call.

However, as defined now, the meaning of a set of registered contacts is
CLEAR. If you want more complex behaviors, you send a CPL (and indeed, the
above service is readily representable in a clear and unambigous way using
CPL). By removing this restriction, and as a consequence, allowing clients
to send all kinds of weird stuff, the end result will not be what users
expect.

I think this was during the days when you were allowed more than one SIP
message in a UDP datagram.

well, i think this is an implementation issue. We just make the assumption
that the rest of the packet is the body and try and parse that.

I think this example is slightly bogus as we both agree 
this should and will be done by CPL. If anything this example 
shows how redundant action params are. As things stand both 
contacts must have been registered with the same action 
param, either proxy or redirect, and then one of them 
overridden by CPL. 

The point isn't to promote action params + q params as an 
alternative to CPL etc it is more about moving towards 
deprecating action params. What users really care about is 
that requests reach them. Whether they do so via an 
intermediate server redirecting or proxying is of considerably 
less interest. So removing a servers compulsion to 409 contacts 
with a mixture of actions is ihmo user friendly.

I would also argue that there is little clarity in the status
quo as presently the only thing specified is that you cannot 
have a mix of action params. You could register all your 
contacts with an action of proxy but a server's local 
config cause it to redirect. Note q params don't come into 
things as they are already ignored in the basic case. 

To better define things we could say is something 
like ...

Clients MAY use the action parameter within registrations
as a hint to a server as to how requests to their contacts be 
handled. Users that want to control a servers action when routing
requests sent to them should use CPL or SIP-CGI. Servers not 
wishing to accept registrations with differing action parameters 
MAY reject them with a status of 409. 

We could go further defining how servers handle mixed action
params if it really bothers people. I think it is a bit of a non
issue - like whether the de facto local server policy is redirect 
or proxy. I just want requests to find me, for greater control I 
use CPL.

Cheers,
Neil.

Not to forget the cases where we encapsulate everything in morse code
and smoke signals - after all, SIP is newer than those methods, so... :)

And wrong you should be using the "methods" parameter not "method" throughout
but that isn't my main point.

This is the worst of both worlds and inconsistent, and as caller preferences
aren't in the base spec, this can't be in the base spec. The best option I
believe is to change the MUST to a MAY. The q parameter also has no use in the
base spec (section 4.2.6.3) and so can't really be used in arguments for
mandating 409s for conflicting actions in the base spec.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: The SIP Supported Header
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-serverfeatures-03.txt
	Pages		: 7
	Date		: 12-Feb-01
	
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that
allows a client to request that a particular protocol extension be
used to process the request. The server declines the request if it
does not support the extension. However, there is currently no way
for a server to determine which extensions are supported by the
client. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the server
to tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define
a way for a client to query a server about the extensions it
supports. This document defines a SIP extension that allows clients
to indicate, in a request, the set of extensions supported. We also
define a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request,
to determine the extensions supported by a server.

Gonzalo,

I'm not sure were completely understanding each other here.

I think we do agree that there is value in the SIP-T concept, so that the
PSTN can interwork with services provided in the 'pure SIP' network by SIP
proxy servers.

I think that the path we're on of including ISUP messages inside SIP
messages is as good as any other for this, so I don't see any value in
pursuing alternatives, such as setting up a SIGTRAN session for the ISUP
signalling.

I do not see the problem, though, with allowing PSTN gateways to switch to a
more efficient mode of overlap signalling once the gateway out of the SIP
network has been identified. Sure, whilst the call is still progressing
through the SIP network, and we want to make use of the routing capabilities
in the SIP network, we use normal SIP procedures, but once we have hit the
PSTN gateway, why not optimise things ?

Why ? How can you possibly know that all services in all networks will work
this way ? There are a host of reasons why routing of the INVITE might vary
due to factors other than the digits. INVITES for the *same digits* might
route differently, and not just due to load balancing.

All proxies which want to provide services: 
a) which operate *after* the INVITE has been routed and the terminating
point in the SIP network found,
b) which require access to the full PSTN number,
c) on PSTN -> SIP-T -> PSTN calls,
d) which are delivered on overlap calls, and
e) which do not know the dial-plan well enough to identity end-of-dialling
themselves.

I think right now this is the empty set, so, yes, I can upgrade all these
:-)

<TITLE>RE: [SIP] Operlap dialing within a SIP network</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Gonzalo,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I'm not sure were completely understanding each other =
here.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think we do agree that there is value in the SIP-T =
concept, so that the PSTN can interwork with services provided in the =
'pure SIP' network by SIP proxy servers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think that the path we're on of including ISUP =
messages inside SIP messages is as good as any other for this, so I =
don't see any value in pursuing alternatives, such as setting up a =
SIGTRAN session for the ISUP signalling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I do not see the problem, though, with allowing PSTN =
gateways to switch to a more efficient mode of overlap signalling once =
the gateway out of the SIP network has been identified. Sure, whilst =
the call is still progressing through the SIP network, and we want to =
make use of the routing capabilities in the SIP network, we use normal =
SIP procedures, but once we have hit the PSTN gateway, why not optimise =
things ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&lt;snip&gt;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 2) The UAC must use source routing to =
ensure that all these INVITES</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; make it to the same UAS</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; What is the problem here? This is done in order =
to address the problem</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of proxies performing load balancing. Some =
folks have pointed out that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; maybe the betwork wants to route the second =
INVITE in a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; different way...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; why the network would like to do that? The =
policy that is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; applicable to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the fist INVITE (that contained a prefix of the =
number) should be the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; same that applies to the subsequent =
ones.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Why ? How can you possibly know that all services in =
all networks will work this way ? There are a host of reasons why =
routing of the INVITE might vary due to factors other than the digits. =
INVITES for the *same digits* might route differently, and not just due =
to load balancing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&lt;snip&gt;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; The price we pay for this is that =
intermediate proxies may not have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; access to the full Called Party Number - =
but a proxy that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; needs this,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that wants to offer service on overlap =
calls, can always sniff the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; overlap digits as they go past.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Let me get this straight. Are you are proposing =
to change the logic in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; all the already existing proxies because you =
want to provide services</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; when you use INFO for carrying SAMs? This is =
just impossible.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>All proxies which want to provide services: </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>a) which operate *after* the INVITE has been routed =
and the terminating point in the SIP network found,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>b) which require access to the full PSTN =
number,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>c) on PSTN -&gt; SIP-T -&gt; PSTN calls,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>d) which are delivered on overlap calls, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>e) which do not know the dial-plan well enough to =
identity end-of-dialling themselves.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think right now this is the empty set, so, yes, I =
can upgrade all these :-)</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Regards,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Mark Watson</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Nortel Networks</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I still prefer a mechanism that do not require =
changes in the existing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxies (multiple call-legs).</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Tom,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Still I want to have full state in =
every SIP message. If </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the call is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; addresed to the phone number 1234, I =
want to have a to field that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; says</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1234. I do not care if there is a leg =
routed thru the PSTN and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; thru SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Carrying full state is one of the =
beauties of SIP. If we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; begin using</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; INFO for this, it would be the same =
as using SAMs. Differen names,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; same thing... I do not want to =
re-create ISUP using SIP. I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; if the session has a destination, it =
should be present in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; to field.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, if a proxy is providing =
services for this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; particular call, it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will want to see the called party =
number in order to trigger</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the proper</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; service. This is a very good reason =
for updating the to field</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; every time</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; we have more digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I like to use SIP between two =
gateways because it is possible</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; to provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIP services for a PSTN to PSTN call. =
If all we want to do is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; finding a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; egrees gateway, we would probably =
want to use other </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; protocols (TRIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &amp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; SIGTRAN for instance).</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do not agree with these =
two statements:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The 1st INVITE (with just =
some digits) arrives to a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; vanilla SIP UA.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will return a Not Found or =
a 484 Address incomplete. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying more digits will =
be discarded. Thus, the PSTN to SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will have to re issue a new =
INVITE with all the digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better to begin directly =
using er-INVITEs rather than INFO.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, I do not think =
that SIP is just a transport protocol</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carries ISUP messages =
between two gateways. For that, we have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIGTRAN. SIP might be used =
to provide services, even when the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call is a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PSTN-SIP-PSTN call. Thus, =
SIP messages MUST carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. And a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIP message with an =
incomplete to field does not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; carry complete</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What if my SIP proxy =
provides a service for a </FONT>

--=====================_5178866==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi folks,

Let's say I send an INVITE to A with a multi-unicast SDP.  I want A to send
(the same) audio to 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, and be prepared to receive audio
from either (or both).

A -- 10.1.1.1
 \
  10.1.1.2

Here is part of my INVITE:
INVITE sip:A -> 
... 
m=audio 16902 0 
c=10.1.1.1 
m=audio 19764 0 
c=10.1.1.2

Now according to the m= line matching rules, I need all the lines to match.  So
which of the following are valid responses?  It seems that none of them have
the desired semantics.

Two m= lines, but use the same port  (is this allowed?)

        <- 200
        ...  
m=audio 17804 0 
c=10.1.1.3 
m=audio 17804 0 
c=10.1.1.3

Two m= lines, one port set to zero (doesn't this mean "i won't accept that
stream"?)
<- 200

Hello,
Wouldnt the response be unique from each host, regardless of the mcast
INVITE, since the INVITE specifies which listening port is open on the
caller to each recipient?

One callee wouldnt respond with a listening port on behalf of the other
callee, would they?

I'll go and read up on this, since these are assumptions on my part.
Chris.

Hi,

I think it is important to define what we want to optimize - the SIP
network, the GW, or something else. I think that we during this
discussion has clarified that it will not matter very much on the PSTN
side, but on the SIP side. The advantages of using INFO - or, let say of
not using re-INVITEs - would be:

1. We save network capacity, because we don't have to send ACKs for
every re-INVITE. This may not sound too much for a single client but for
PSTN gateways, where overlap dialing most likely will be used, I think
we can assume that we are talking about a significant number of
messages.

2. The logic in the UAS GW would be more simple, because it would not
need
to compare the Request-URI in the re-INVITEs with the Request-URI in the
previous INVITE, to generate the correct SAM messages (using INFO, you
just send the new digits, and the GW generate SAMs of them).

3. If (again, this has nothing to do with the overlap procedure itself)
you have SDP body, and an encapsulated ISUP body (or any other
message-body), in the INVITE, you must send it in every re-INVITE also
(if you receive 484 you would probably always do so, but you may also
send your re-INVITE before you get a response, and/or a proxy may
suddenly re-route the INVITE to another GW, which needs the ISUP body).


The advantage of using re-INVITEs, however, are:

1. You can easier access services in the SIP network

2. The GW UAC have to wait for a non-484 response for your INVITEs
before you start using INFO, instead you can send your re-INVITEs as
soon as you receive a SAM from ISUP. It has been discussed that the GW
UAS would send some kind of provisional response when it has received
enough digits to route the call forward. So, until you get that
provisional response you will have to wait for the response to every
INVITE you send before you can send the next INVITE, which may include
buffering of SAMs in your GW UAC, and that is NOT to optimize. 

3. If TRANSACTION overlaping for INFO is not allowed you would also have
to wait for the response to every INFO you send before you can send the
next one, since they belong to the same call-leg (the re-INVITEs are all
different legs, so you don't have transaction overlaping there).

4. You can re-route the call setup to another MGC at any time (the
disadvantage is, like I mentioned, that you have to include your message
bodies, ISUP etc, in every INVITE), since every INVITE will have all
digits in the Request-URI. The new GW UAS would then simply handle the
INVITE as an initial INVITE. Yes, the proxy re-routing the call would
probably also have to CANCEL to old leg (if a 484 was not received,
which would happend if the GW managed to route the call forward in the
PSTN network). With INFO that would not be possible. First, the proxy
would have to "transfer" the INFO into an INVITE, but that would not
help because the UAC still has an ongoing INVITE transaction, and does
not want a response to an INFO method it never even sent.

The question is, how do we differentiate between a PSTN gateway and an
VoIP PBX. Both can take advantage of additional digits; only one of them
is capable of receiving ISUP. In the VoIP PBX case, you would want the
additional digits to be sent the "pure SIP" way, i.e. through a
re-invite.

Subject: RE: [SIP] Operlap dialing within a SIP network


Gonzalo, 
I'm not sure were completely understanding each other here. 
I think we do agree that there is value in the SIP-T concept, so that
the PSTN can interwork with services provided in the 'pure SIP' network
by SIP proxy servers.
I think that the path we're on of including ISUP messages inside SIP
messages is as good as any other for this, so I don't see any value in
pursuing alternatives, such as setting up a SIGTRAN session for the ISUP
signalling.
I do not see the problem, though, with allowing PSTN gateways to switch
to a more efficient mode of overlap signalling once the gateway out of
the SIP network has been identified. Sure, whilst the call is still
progressing through the SIP network, and we want to make use of the
routing capabilities in the SIP network, we use normal SIP procedures,
but once we have hit the PSTN gateway, why not optimise things ?

Why ? How can you possibly know that all services in all networks will
work this way ? There are a host of reasons why routing of the INVITE
might vary due to factors other than the digits. INVITES for the *same
digits* might route differently, and not just due to load balancing.

All proxies which want to provide services: 
a) which operate *after* the INVITE has been routed and the terminating
point in the SIP network found, 
b) which require access to the full PSTN number, 
c) on PSTN -> SIP-T -> PSTN calls, 
d) which are delivered on overlap calls, and 
e) which do not know the dial-plan well enough to identity
end-of-dialling themselves. 
I think right now this is the empty set, so, yes, I can upgrade all
these :-)

Hi,

I think we came to consensus that for unicast SDP, you must either have SDP
in the INV/200 or in the 200/ACK.  Reading the conferencing models draft, I
realized that for multicast the spec permits different behavior:

>   Inviting users to join is simple. Any user may invite any other user
>   to join. The SIP INVITE request contains SDP that indicates multicast
>   addresses for each media line. The SDP in the 200 OK response may
>   actually be empty. From Section B.3 of RFC2543:
>        For multicast, receive and send multicast addresses are the
>        same and all parties use the same port numbers to receive
>        media data. If the session description provided by the
>        caller is acceptable to the callee, the callee can choose
>        not to include a session description or MAY echo the
>        description in the response.

so my question is, should it be OK to send no SDP in INVITE, multicast SDP
in 200, and no SDP in ACK?

My proposal is that we deprecate the old behavior, and encourage
implementations which receive a multicast SDP in an INVITE to echo it back
in the 200; and likewise if no SDP was in an INVITE, to echo the multicast
SDP from a 200 in the ACK.

Does this seem reasonable?

thanks,
-rohan

Hi every one,I am just focusing on SIP in 3GPP now,but I don't know about
it,I wonder if anyone can direct me some materials or reference about SIP,so
that I can learn it quickly!
I will thank every one here first,thank you!!!
 
Any advice is welcome!!!!

  Careful: If A accepts the INVITE, it should be prepared to receive

  (personal opinion) I think it should be this.  Because your SDP may be
modified by a third party, or transcoded, or whatever, I believe that
the two session descriptions (local and remote) to be completely
independant:  advertise what you are willing to receive, the remote end
will do the same, we'll talk happily.  I'm against the idea of m= line
matching.

Optimizing things means to use an optimal way for transporting overlap
signalling, right? Then, you want to use SIGTRAN. Efficient, allows
multi-homing, low overhead, etc...

Using INFO breaks all the application servers in the SIP network.
Besides, it breaks SIP itself (as I have been pointing out a number of
times in this thread already).

But people are more worried about saving one message (the ACK) than
about being coherent with the way SIP services will be provided.

Let me explain this point. If the network has routed in a certain way
(that, as you say, might depend on a thousand of parameters) the first
INVITE, the following INFOs (assuming that you use INFO for sending
SAMs) will be routed in the same way, right?

Well, then, the re-INVITEs belonging to the same call have to be routed
in the same way also. So, even if the network decides not to honor the
record route present in the INVITE, the message will be routed in the
same way.

The only expection is when the routing decision is made randomly, that
is, without depending on any parameters. This is, the same message might
be routed in a different way depending on the time of the day, for
instance. Then, this is load balancing, and that is why source routing
is used.

All these proxies are NOT standard SIP proxies. They examine INFO
messages in order to provide services... if you want to implement your
network in a non-standard way, it is up to you. I will implement my
network in a way that allows the same SIP proxy to handle SIP-SIP calls,
PSTN-SIP calls, etc...

And this was Jonathan was trying to say in his mail. The application
server architecture will work well if re-INVITEs are used. It won't if
INFOs are used.

But anyway, if you still want to use INFO and you intend to implement
non-standard SIP proxies to provide your services, it is all up to
you... I just don't buy that.

Gonzalo

Hello Christer,

This thread has already too many messages, and folks seem to respond
without taking into consideration previous answers:

> 2. The logic in the UAS GW would be more simple, because it would not
> need
> to compare the Request-URI in the re-INVITEs with the Request-URI in the
> previous INVITE, to generate the correct SAM messages (using INFO, you
> just send the new digits, and the GW generate SAMs of them).

AS I said before, INFO does not ensure ordered delibery. So, if you do
what you are just describing, it will NOT work. You will get an INFO
with a SAM before the previous INFO with the previous SAM arrives... you
will just shuffle the digits of the number... BAD IDEA.

However, you might argue that you will use a new request-URI. Well, this
is not standard SIP again. You should honor the contact header you have
received, and not modify it on your own... again, you are thinking just
about gateways.

I would like you to think about normal clients, APS, etc... then, you
will see that instead of simplifying your gateways, you are adding
complexity, because you will have to implement standard SIP to interwork
with vanilla UAs and your SIP-T with INFOs to interwork with other
gateways.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

This happens naturally: the VOIP PBX knows its dialling plan and can tell if
not enough digits have been received.  By hypothesis, the outgoing gateway
to the PSTN is unable to tell if all needed digits have been received, but
knows how to route the call onward.

Christer raised the issue of how to handle the case where an entity beyond
the gateway determines that more digits are needed.  I would suggest that it
works the same as a pure PSTN call: either the caller voluntarily provides
more digits or the call eventually times out and fails.

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>This happens naturally: the VOIP PBX knows its =
dialling plan and can tell if not enough digits have been =
received.&nbsp; By hypothesis, the outgoing gateway to the PSTN is =
unable to tell if all needed digits have been received, but knows how =
to route the call onward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Christer raised the issue of how to handle the case =
where an entity beyond the gateway determines that more digits are =
needed.&nbsp; I would suggest that it works the same as a pure PSTN =
call: either the caller voluntarily provides more digits or the call =
eventually times out and fails.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The question is, how do we differentiate =
between a PSTN gateway and an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; VoIP PBX. Both can take advantage of additional =
digits; only </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; one of them</FONT>

case, you would want the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; additional digits to be sent the &quot;pure =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Gonzalo, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I'm not sure were completely understanding each =
other here. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I think we do agree that there is value in the =
SIP-T concept, so that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the PSTN can interwork with services provided =
in the 'pure </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; SIP' network</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; by SIP proxy servers.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I think that the path we're on of including =
ISUP messages inside SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; messages is as good as any other for this, so I =
don't see any value in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; pursuing alternatives, such as setting up a =
SIGTRAN session </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; for the ISUP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; signalling.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I do not see the problem, though, with allowing =
PSTN gateways </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to switch</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to a more efficient mode of overlap signalling =
once the gateway out of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the SIP network has been identified. Sure, =
whilst the call is still</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; progressing through the SIP network, and we =
want to make use of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; routing capabilities in the SIP network, we use =
normal SIP procedures,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; but once we have hit the PSTN gateway, why not =
optimise things ?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &lt;snip&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The UAC must use source routing to =
ensure that all </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; these INVITES </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; make it to the same UAS </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; What is the problem here? This is done in =
order to address </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the problem</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; of proxies performing load balancing. Some =
folks have </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; pointed out that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; maybe the betwork wants to route the =
second INVITE in a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; different way... </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; why the network would like to do that? The =
policy that is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; applicable to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the fist INVITE (that contained a prefix =
of the number) </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; should be the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; same that applies to the subsequent ones. =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Why ? How can you possibly know that all =
services in all networks will</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; work this way ? There are a host of reasons why =
routing of the INVITE</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; might vary due to factors other than the =
digits. INVITES for the *same</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits* might route differently, and not just =
due to load balancing.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &lt;snip&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The price we pay for this is that =
intermediate proxies </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; may not have </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; access to the full Called Party =
Number - but a proxy that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; needs this, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; that wants to offer service on =
overlap calls, can always </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; sniff the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; overlap digits as they go past. =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Let me get this straight. Are you are =
proposing to change </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the logic in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; all the already existing proxies because =
you want to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; provide services </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; when you use INFO for carrying SAMs? This =
is just impossible. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; All proxies which want to provide services: =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; a) which operate *after* the INVITE has been =
routed and the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; terminating</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; point in the SIP network found, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; b) which require access to the full PSTN =
number, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; c) on PSTN -&gt; SIP-T -&gt; PSTN calls, =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; d) which are delivered on overlap calls, and =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; e) which do not know the dial-plan well enough =
to identity</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; end-of-dialling themselves. </FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still I want to have full state =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addresed to the phone number =
1234, I want to have a to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; field that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; says </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1234. I do not care if there is =
a leg routed thru the PSTN and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; another </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thru SIP. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carrying full state is one of =
the beauties of SIP. If we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; begin using </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO for this, it would be the =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same thing... I do not want to =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the session has a =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to field. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, if a proxy is providing =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will want to see the called =

Hi,

That is the way it must work, because the entity beyond the gateway can
not tell the gateway to send a 484 response to ask for more digits. 

And, at the end, what I mentioned before, if the sending gateway
receives more digits, nothing stops it from sending re-INVITES - no
matter if a 484 has been received for the previous INVITE or not.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Gonzalo,

My mail was not yet another proposal for using INFO, I simply tried to
define how we could "optimize" our system by using re-INVITEs and by not
using re-INVITEs.

Well, sending re-INVITEs doesn't ensure you more ordered delivery
either. Yes, the difference is that in the INVITE you will always
receive ALL digits, not only the new-ones, so that solves that issue.
 
>However, you might argue that you will use a new request-URI. Well, this

You could have a separate header in the INFO with ALL digits, but then
the digit processing in the UAS GW probably would not be more simple
than by using re-INVITEs, so I agree that you will not optimize in that
sense by using INFO :)

>You should honor the contact header you have received, and not modify it >on your own... again, you are thinking just about gateways.

What Contact header would I get in the 484 anyway??? The responding
gateway doesn't know which the new digits are going to be. I can only
get the host part in the Contact, and that is going to be the same no
matter which method I use.

E.g., assume I send an INVITE to 123@mgw.com, and receive a 484. The UAC
gateway has now received more digits, 456, so I send a new INVITE to
123456@mgw.com. The UAS gateway, however, didn't know that I was going
to use that Request-URI, so it couldn't have put those extra digits in
the user part of the Contact header in the 484 response.

And, if I send the re-INVITE before I get the response to the previous
INVITE, OR I don't get a response at all because the UAS gateway has
received enough digits to route the call to the next PSTN entity, the
UAC gateway will not even get a Contact header before it sends the next
re-INVITE.

AND, according to the draft the Contact header in a 484 response is used
ONLY to indicate where more info about the error can be found, not where
to send the next request...

Hi,

I have an issue, which I don't know if it has has been discussed before,
but at least it is not mentioned in the draft.

The draft says that the UAC shall insert all supported option-tags in
the Supported header, that the UAS can send a 421 response etc etc etc.

I think it should be allowed also for a proxy server on the path to
insert it's own option tags in the request, and then handle the feature
correctly if the UAS chooses to use it. This is similar to the
session-timer, where a proxy can choose to use the feature even if the
UAC doesn't.

I also think it should be allowed for a proxy server an option tag from
the Supported header (for example, it may want the next entity not to
require it to be used), but still be able to require it for the entity
from where it received the request.

An example:

-------          -----------          -----------          -------
| UAC |----------| PROXY 1 |----------| PROXY 2 |----------| UAS |
-------          -----------          -----------          -------
    
  -->   INVITE        -->    INVITE       -->     INVITE
        Supported: a         Supported: a,b       Supported: a
     
  <--   200           <--    200          <--     200
                             Require: b
        

In this case "b" could be some advanced feature/service, which the
User-Agents may not be able to handle (or maybe aren't even allowed to,
e.g. for security/billing/management/operator/whatever reasons), but the
proxies will use it between themselves. I mean, isn't this one of the
purposes of proxy servers in the first place: not only to provide
services to the end-users but also within the SIP network?

No, the draft may not say that all this is forbidden (after all, a proxy
also acts like both a UAC and a UAS, so...), but maybe by clarifying it
people would realise how useful the Supported header can be for
services, re-routing, and the use of proxies in general.

And, the same thing should also be allowed for the Require- and
Proxy-Require headers... After all, in a real-world deployment I think
that it is going often to be pretty much the operator, managing the
proxy servers in the network, who is going to decide what users are
allowed to require, and/or show support for, from each other.

Gonzalo,

     It seems you have two main reasons against the use of the INFO
method for the conveyance of subsequent ISUP information:

1) Lack of ordered delivery of the INFO messages

Ordered delivery could be maintained by the UAC not sending the next INFO
until a 200 OK response for the previous one had been received.


2) Lack of state carried in the INFO messge

The digits received so far could be carried in a header within the
INFO message. Each INFO message would then carry the same information
as a re-INVITE.

My reason for exploring the use of INFO is not to save on messages. It is
to do with the issue of source routing. Again, my concern of source
routing is not one of a technical nature. What if an administration has a
security policy that states source routing (a ROUTE header in
an initial INVITE) will not take place in its SIP network but it also requires
that
the same network interworks with the PSTN; if any part of the PSTN interworking
mechanism
relies on source routing then there is a conflict of requirements. It is this
conflict
I wish to address.

Regards,

K. Robinson.

I definitively agree that this is the view that INFO fans have of a SIP
cloud. What I am saying is that this view is wrong. This usage of SIP
falls outside the scope of SIP.
If they want to use SIP for locating a gateway,  it is fine. But after
the gateway has been located, let's use another method for transporting
ISUP signalling.

Let's assume that I get an IAM with "+1", as Jonathan says in his
example. Then the INVITE generated by the gateway will reach the US
gateway. Now, the mission of SIP has finished, since the gateway has
been located. Why don't we put in the body of this INVITE a session
description that comprises a media session and a SIGTRAN session? This
way we would have established these two sessions between the gateways
and all the subsequent ISUP messages would be sent over the SIGTRAN
session.

I find that the usage of SIP that I have just described would be OK.
What I do not understand is why folks want to use SIP for transporting
subsequent ISUP messages. SIP does not have good transport properties
(big overhead, it can run over UDP...). Besides, it does not provide
ordered delivery.

If the INVITE has Cseq=1 and the next message that the egrees gateway
receives is a INFO with Cseq=7... what should the gateway do? Maybe
there were several proxies in the middle asking for credentials for the
INFO, so the ingrees gateway had to add authentication stuff and resend
the INFO. If this was the case, the SAM contained in the INFO would be
the second digit of the called party number... However, maybe 5 INFO
messages got lost, and the SAM that we have received in the body of the
INFO makes no sense without the previous ones because is the 7th digit
of the number...

This is not usually a problem in SIP, since all messages have full
state. However, using INFO for sending SAMs breaks this rule, and
therefore it breaks the SIP model.

I believe that considering that the session is established after the
first INVITE and sending the following SAMs using INFO is making one of
the mistakes described in the guidelines for SIP authors: "We need to
transport ISUP signalling over IP between two gateways. Both gateways
already implement SIP... why do we have to implement another protocol?
Let's use SIP to transport ISUP signalling". We are just trying to use
SIP for this just because it would save implementing yet another
protocol in the gateways.

I strongly disagree with this usage of SIP. SIP-T is good as long as the
SIP cloud provides services. If not, SIP-T is not a good protocol for
transporting ISUP signalling.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

Hi,

I am not Gonzalo, but I will comment anyway... :)

I am strongly against that. We would have to start buffering incoming
SAMs, and by having to wait for the response before sending the next
INVITE it would slow down the setup time between the nodes.

This is also related with the PRACK issue, where we also may have to do
buffering becuase we have to wait for messages (which means we may have
to do buffering), but that is another issue...

I am not sure I understood this correctly. But, in either case the UAC
will have to send an initial INVITE, so it can choose to insert a ROUTE
header. I think that the administrator proxies in the network should be
able to handle that, e.g. either by refusing the message (a proxy should
have the last say about if a message is allowed to be routed in a
specific way or not), sending a 3xx response (to re-route the call), or
simply by removing the ROUTE header (I know that is not allowed, but the
there is also an issue of allowing ROUTE in the initial INVITE in the
first place, so...). In another mail I pointed out that the network
operator administrator most likely wants to have good control of the
network, so I think it should be allowed for proxies to do these kind of
things. Otherwise one can send anything in the requests, and soon we
will have a bunch of "SIP Viruses" out there...

Actually my main reason against the use of INFO is that it does not work
with vanilla SIP UAs and vanilla SIP Application Servers. How you
resolve the technical issues related to INFO does not really matter to
me. It is not "vanilla" SIP, and I am against this kind of non-standard
mechanisms.

OK, let's address this. Source routing is proposed in the draft to
address load balancing. This is, a proxy that sends INVITEs to different
egrees gateways.

So, if an IAM and one SAM are received, the second INVITE might end up
in another gateway than the fist INVITE. This would trigger 2 IAMs
instead of 1 IAM and 1 SAM.

OK, this is the problem that has to be solved. What I wanted to say in
the draft (I did not have lot of time and it has to be rephrased), was
the following:

It is strongly RECOMMENDED that proxies route requests that are
basically identical and just differ in the to field (more digits) in the
same way. So, if such as proxy performs load balancing, all the
subsequent INVITEs will reach the same egrees gateway.

This is not difficult to do, because most likely a call to +1234 has to
be routed in the same way as a call to +12345. So, the only real
requirement in that proxies do not make routing decisions based on
random variables (such as internal clocks).

Then, just in case folks did not feel comfortable with this solution
(which I believe is the good one), I outlined the source routing
solution.

And what about load balancing? You can still have load balancing. Your
proxy makes the routing decision based on to, from, and what ever fields
it wants. Then, it can calculate a digest of some fields, and make a
"random" routing decision based on that hash. This provides load
balancing but still routes INVITEs carrying SAMs in the proper way.

Does this resolve your issue?

Best regards,

Gonzalo

This is exactly my concern. What if proxies are configured to reject or
ignore the ROUTE header of requests which are attempting to source route.
The initial INVITEs sending subsequent digits may not reach the (correct) UAS
if they had to traverse such networks and so the mechanism would fail.

I am strongly against that. We would have to start buffering incoming
SAMs, and by having to wait for the response before sending the next
INVITE it would slow down the setup time between the nodes.

This is also related with the PRACK issue, where we also may have to do
buffering becuase we have to wait for messages (which means we may have
to do buffering), but that is another issue...

I am not sure I understood this correctly. But, in either case the UAC
will have to send an initial INVITE, so it can choose to insert a ROUTE
header. I think that the administrator proxies in the network should be
able to handle that, e.g. either by refusing the message (a proxy should
have the last say about if a message is allowed to be routed in a
specific way or not), sending a 3xx response (to re-route the call), or
simply by removing the ROUTE header (I know that is not allowed, but the
there is also an issue of allowing ROUTE in the initial INVITE in the
first place, so...). In another mail I pointed out that the network
operator administrator most likely wants to have good control of the
network, so I think it should be allowed for proxies to do these kind of
things. Otherwise one can send anything in the requests, and soon we
will have a bunch of "SIP Viruses" out there...

A is indicating it wants to both media streams sent to the same 
address and port.  This seems fine to me and is the correct 
response IMHO to achieve what you want.

A is saying it'll send and receive the first stream and neither 
send, nor receive the second.

>

>

> 

A is saying it'll send and receive the first stream but is placing 
the second stream on hold.  However, if the INVITE didn't come 
from 10.1.1.2 the endpoint receiving the response will have to 
pass on A's desire to 10.1.1.2 if A doesn't want to deal with 
two media streams.

This is an incorrect response since the second m= line is 
missing.

Bert

Hello Rohan,

You might want to check
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-fid-00.txt
this draft defines the concept of flow (as opposed to media stream).

Best regards,

Gonzalo

Hi,
 I would like to know if the rfc bis-02 has to be followed while implementing SIP or the original RFC. Because there are some deviations are present which are not mentioned in the changes section.

regards,
 Vijeth

Hi,
 
   1. The rfc specifies that the communication b/n the proxies and the location servers is out of scope of the document. Can anybody tell me what document or rfc to refer to understand about this communication.

   2. Also there is not much information about the functioning of the SIP registrars in the RFC. Is there any document or draft specifying the same.?

regards,
  Vijeth

I don't see this as a protocol issue, but more how the operator has
built and configured his network. Also, you have the same problem in
other cases too, eg with the session-timer. If a server reboots, when it
is going to receive the refresh re-INVITE it is going to process it as
an INVITE for a new call, and there may be ROUTE headers in that INVITE,
so...

And, I don't see how you solve this issue by using INFO. You still have
to send at least one initial INVITE, in which your UA, for some reason,
may insert ROUTE headers. Again, in this case I don't see it as a
problem if a proxy will reject that, because I think the proxies should
decide about the routing, not the UA. However, like I mentioned earlier,
it IS a problem with the session-timer...

Actually, I realise you would have the ROUTE problem with EVERY INVITE
you send. Since ROUTE is only
per call-leg, and every INVITE represents a new call-leg, every INVITE
you send would be processed as an INITIAL INVITE request by proxies and
UAs, and if you include ROUTE headers you will have the same problem for
every INVITE (using INFO, every message is sent for the same call-leg,
so you will not have problems with ROUTE).

Of course, nothing forces you to insert ROUTE headers in your next
INVITE, since it represents a separate call-leg, but I assume the
problem is that we often want to do so, to make sure they follow the
same path.

However, like I mentioned earlier, ROUTE in initial INVITEs is a general
problem for SIP, so from that point of view using INFOs would only be a
"hack" to get around an existing SIP problem.

A proxy can be intelligent enough to distinguish between an initial INVITE
with a ROUTE header (source routing) and a re-INVITE received after
a reboot; in the case of the initial INVITE, the TO tag field MUST be empty;
in the case of the re-INVITE after a reboot the TO tag field MUST NOT  be
empty. So a proxy can be configured to disallow source routing, while
still able to support the session-timer re-INVITE after a reboot, thereby
remaining robust.

Of course, clients may attempt to source route, and such requests
may well be rejected if they traverse a network with a security policy
tha disallows it. Its an interoperability issue when going between
administrative domains.

I don't see this as a protocol issue, but more how the operator has
built and configured his network. Also, you have the same problem in
other cases too, eg with the session-timer. If a server reboots, when it
is going to receive the refresh re-INVITE it is going to process it as
an INVITE for a new call, and there may be ROUTE headers in that INVITE,
so...

And, I don't see how you solve this issue by using INFO. You still have
to send at least one initial INVITE, in which your UA, for some reason,
may insert ROUTE headers. Again, in this case I don't see it as a
problem if a proxy will reject that, because I think the proxies should
decide about the routing, not the UA. However, like I mentioned earlier,
it IS a problem with the session-timer...

Like I wrote in another mail on the thread, we have a problem using
INVITEs too. They all represent different call-legs, and since ROUTE is
per call-leg only, every INVITE will be processed as an initial INVITE,
and having ROUTE headers in an initial INVITE is still a problem and
open issue, so I would not say it is "vanilla" SIP...

The problem is that you recommend this in the ISUP-SIP draft, which most
of the
proxy vendors may not even have read... If this is something to be
recommended for
proxies, I think it must be in the bis draft. Otherwise I think we must
add some kind of
Proxy-Require option-tag in your draft, but then it's not "vanlilla" SIP
anymore, so...

Another recommendation could be that proxies that DO change the routing
shall send a CANCEL to where the previous INVITE was sent, unless a 484
response was received for that INVITE. That way we would not have
multiple "pending" call setups on the PSTN side.

Actually, if we would make all this as a Proxy-Require option-tag
("Proxy-Require: overlap", or something...), compliant proxies MUST to
all this. Then, if you don't want to get the routing-, and multiple
IAM-, problems in your network, you just buy these kind of proxies.
Simple :)

Well, now you assume that the "load balance" stuff in the proxy is done
depending on the user part, ie. the phone number, which I don't think is
always going to be the case.

A proxy may not even look at the phone number. It may send the INVITEs
to different gateways anyway, for example if the DNS lookup for the next
INVITE will return different IP addresses, IP addresses in different
order, or whatever... There may also be other reasons, load balance
reasons, why you would send your INVITEs to IP addresses, without even
looking at the user part (in this case, the phone number). We should
also remember that a proxy will not always send the request to the
gateway. It may go to another proxy, etc etc.

That is one, unfortunately very common, way to "solve" problems... :)

This is what I said, but this is all stuff you assume...

I think we have two options here:

1. Add the overlap routing stuff to the bis document. It would still
only be a recommendation (a SHALL, I guess..), but that's better than
nothing.

2. Define an "overlap" option-tag, for example in the ISUP-SIP draft.
Now compliant proxies would have to do the routing as you assume, and we
could even add my CANCEL proposal, and have a MUST to accept ROUTE
headers in new INVITEs at least if the phone number is different. Of
course, this would not be "vanilla" SIP, but... And, you could still use
"normal" proxies, but have to be aware of the issues that may occur.

Hmmm, this is perhaps a slightly larger issue than suits this thread, but
anyway:
 
If there is no 'man in the middle' i.e. you can find and connect to your
destination directly at the IP layer, then this is essentially a private
transaction between you and the destination. You can do what you like in
this context - it's just up to you and the destination to agree between
youselves. (Although you still both have to respect applicable Data
Protection Legislation in respect of any personal information you receive
from each other.)
 
If you make your connection via an intermediate proxy or proxies operated by
a third party, presumably you do this because those proxies offer some kind
of service (e.g. routing). If the third party makes this service publically
available, then this is whom I consider the 'public network'.
 
Of course there will be many such service providers that a user can choose
from - though there is plenty of work going on to invent ways of restricting
a users choice in certain environments.

Uh, what is exactly the "public network" that you are talking about? The ISP
to which my entreprise network connects have no idea of what the bits in the
packets are, and probably don't want to know. The basic SIP solution is
end-to-end, with the network being essentially transparent. Sure, there may
be competing voice service providers that want to provide added value on top
of the basic service, but we cannot assume that there has to be a man in the
middle.

Subject: RE: [SIP] Re: Location information



The public network will likely be trusted in the sense that it promises to
obey the user's stated privacy requirements, indeed Data Protection
legislation will usually oblige the public network provider to do this.
Also, it will likely be a requirement of the public service that terminals
identify themselves in some way.

I do not think it likely that for Emergency calls, terminals/networks will
behave differently with respect to identity information than for normal
calls except that it will probably not be considered an infringement of
privacy to deliver identity information to an Emergency call centre even
when the user has requested it be kept private.

More complex is how does the public service provider verify the identity and
location information ? In the example above, the public service provider can
only be sure of the owner of the Enterprise network from which the call
came, and this may not translate into a single geographic location. The
network would be forced to send forward only the 'unverified' location
information provided by the caller.

Yes, a proxy can do this, and we can assume that it do that... But, like
I said earlier,
it should be written down then, either in the bis as a SHOULD, or in the
ISUP-SIP as an
option-tag extension, ie a MUST.

I guess that could work. But again, how many proxy implementations work
that way? Since we can't make it a MUST for proxy (for backward
compability), the question is, again, if it should be a SHOULD in the
bis, or an Proxy-Require option tag extension.

Gonzalo,

I don't understand your comment about the INFO Overlap proposals causing
problems for 'vanilla' SIP UAs. My suggestion was that the use of INFOs for
overlap digits be negotiated between UAC and UAS.

So, the UAC would include a 'Supported' tag if it could do overlap INFOs and
the mechanism would then only be used if both ends supported it. Otherwise
you would just kill session requests without enough digits with 484s.

Regarding Application Servers, the INFOs should certainly contain all the
digits so far (otherwise we get the problems with lost messages). I do not
believe any proxies exist which are being used today in overlap situations
and which need access to the whole called number, so we can add this
capability to the specification without hurting any existing
implementations.

Finally, there are many reasons other than simple load balancing why one
INVITE might be routed differently to a subsequent, apparently identical,
one. e.g. Time of day routing - which is certainly not 'random'. Stateful
proxies may also remember where they sent the INVITE so that subsequent
requests on the same call leg can be routed the same way.

Regards,

Mark Watson

<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Gonzalo,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I don't understand your comment about the INFO =
Overlap proposals causing problems for 'vanilla' SIP UAs. My suggestion =
was that the use of INFOs for overlap digits be negotiated between UAC =
and UAS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>So, the UAC would include a 'Supported' tag if it =
could do overlap INFOs and the mechanism would then only be used if =
both ends supported it. Otherwise you would just kill session requests =
without enough digits with 484s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Regarding Application Servers, the INFOs should =
certainly contain all the digits so far (otherwise we get the problems =
with lost messages). I do not believe any proxies exist which are being =
used today in overlap situations and which need access to the whole =
called number, so we can add this capability to the specification =
without hurting any existing implementations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Finally, there are many reasons other than simple =
load balancing why one INVITE might be routed differently to a =
subsequent, apparently identical, one. e.g. Time of day routing - which =
is certainly not 'random'. Stateful proxies may also remember where =
they sent the INVITE so that subsequent requests on the same call leg =
can be routed the same way.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; does not work</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; with vanilla SIP UAs and vanilla SIP =
Application Servers. How you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; resolve the technical issues related to INFO =
does not really matter to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; me. It is not &quot;vanilla&quot; SIP, and I am =
against this kind of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; non-standard</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; mechanisms.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; My reason for exploring the use of INFO is =
not to save on </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; messages. It is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to do with the issue of source routing. =
Again, my concern of source</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; routing is not one of a technical nature. =
What if an </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; administration has a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; security policy that states source routing =
(a ROUTE header in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; an initial INVITE) will not take place in =
its SIP network </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; but it also requires</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the same network interworks with the PSTN; =
if any part of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the PSTN interworking</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; mechanism</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; relies on source routing then there is a =
conflict of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; requirements. It is this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; conflict</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I wish to address.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; OK, let's address this. Source routing is =
proposed in the draft to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; address load balancing. This is, a proxy that =
sends INVITEs </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to different</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; egrees gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; So, if an IAM and one SAM are received, the =
second INVITE might end up</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; in another gateway than the fist INVITE. This =
would trigger 2 IAMs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; instead of 1 IAM and 1 SAM.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; OK, this is the problem that has to be solved. =
What I wanted to say in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the draft (I did not have lot of time and it =
has to be rephrased), was</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the following:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; It is strongly RECOMMENDED that proxies route =
requests that are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; basically identical and just differ in the to =
field (more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits) in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; same way. So, if such as proxy performs load =
balancing, all the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; subsequent INVITEs will reach the same egrees =
gateway.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; This is not difficult to do, because most =
likely a call to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; +1234 has to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; be routed in the same way as a call to +12345. =
So, the only real</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; requirement in that proxies do not make routing =
decisions based on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; random variables (such as internal =
clocks).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Then, just in case folks did not feel =
comfortable with this solution</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (which I believe is the good one), I outlined =
the source routing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; solution.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; And what about load balancing? You can still =
have load balancing. Your</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxy makes the routing decision based on to, =
from, and what </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ever fields</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it wants. Then, it can calculate a digest of =
some fields, and make a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;random&quot; routing decision based on =
that hash. This provides load</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; balancing but still routes INVITEs carrying =
SAMs in the proper way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Does this resolve your issue?</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the correct answer about =
which approach to use </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (INFO vs. multiple</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; call legs) depends on your view of =
the scope of the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; address within the sip</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; cloud. If you believe that the sip =
role has ended once </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; you have enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; digits to select an egress gateway =
(which may be as few </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; as one, i.e., +1</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; selects a US gateway), then the sip =
address of that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; gateway can be viewed as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; sip:+1@provider.com, and all =
subsequent digits are PSTN </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; issues, outside the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; scope of SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I definitively agree that this is the view =
that INFO fans </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; have of a SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; cloud. What I am saying is that this view =
is wrong. This </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; usage of SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; falls outside the scope of SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; If they want to use SIP for locating a =
gateway,&nbsp; it is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; fine. But after</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the gateway has been located, let's use =
another method for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; transporting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; ISUP signalling.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Let's assume that I get an IAM with =
&quot;+1&quot;, as Jonathan says in his</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; example. Then the INVITE generated by the =
gateway will reach the US</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; gateway. Now, the mission of SIP has =
finished, since the gateway has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; been located. Why don't we put in the body =
of this INVITE a session</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; description that comprises a media session =
and a SIGTRAN </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; session? This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; way we would have established these two =
sessions between </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the gateways</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; and all the subsequent ISUP messages would =
be sent over the SIGTRAN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; session.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I find that the usage of SIP that I have =
just described would be OK.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; What I do not understand is why folks want =
to use SIP for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; transporting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; subsequent ISUP messages. SIP does not =
have good transport </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; properties</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; (big overhead, it can run over UDP...). =
Besides, it does not provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; ordered delivery.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; If the INVITE has Cseq=3D1 and the next =
message that the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; egrees gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; receives is a INFO with Cseq=3D7... what =
should the gateway do? Maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; there were several proxies in the middle =
asking for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; credentials for the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INFO, so the ingrees gateway had to add =
authentication </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; stuff and resend</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the INFO. If this was the case, the SAM =
contained in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INFO would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the second digit of the called party =
number... However, maybe 5 INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; messages got lost, and the SAM that we =
have received in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; body of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INFO makes no sense without the previous =
ones because is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the 7th digit</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; of the number...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; This is not usually a problem in SIP, =
since all messages have full</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; state. However, using INFO for sending =
SAMs breaks this rule, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; therefore it breaks the SIP model.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I believe that considering that the =
session is established after the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; first INVITE and sending the following =
SAMs using INFO is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; making one of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the mistakes described in the guidelines =
for SIP authors: </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;We need to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; transport ISUP signalling over IP between =
two gateways. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Both gateways</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; already implement SIP... why do we have to =
implement </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; another protocol?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Let's use SIP to transport ISUP =
signalling&quot;. We are just </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; trying to use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; SIP for this just because it would save =
implementing yet another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; protocol in the gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I strongly disagree with this usage of =
SIP. SIP-T is good </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; as long as the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; SIP cloud provides services. If not, SIP-T =
is not a good </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; protocol for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; transporting ISUP signalling.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still I want to have full state =
in every SIP message. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; If the call is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addresed to the phone number =
1234, I want to have a to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; field that says</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1234. I do not care if there is =
a leg routed thru the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; PSTN and another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thru SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carrying full state is one of =
the beauties of SIP. If </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; we begin using</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO for this, it would be the =
same as using SAMs. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Differen names, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same thing... I do not want to =
re-create ISUP using SIP. I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the session has a =
destination, it should be present in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to field.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, if a proxy is providing =
services for this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; particular call, it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will want to see the called =
party number in order to trigger</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the proper</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; service. This is a very good =
reason for updating the to field</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every time</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have more digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like to use SIP between two =
gateways because it is possible</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIP services for a PSTN to PSTN =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding a</FONT>

The term "public network" has regulatory implications in most countries.
As you say, SIP runs end-to-end over an IP infrastructure.  It can run 
between two endpoints that also terminate the RTP stream (e.g., "SIP 
phones") or it can run between a SIP UA and a proxy/redirect/etc. 
server.  Either way, the two IP hosts running SIP are endpoints on the IP 
network and (may) have a customer relationship with the IP network provider 
(i.e., not belong to the IP access provider).

In this case, I may go Christian's question one step further and ask  "what 
is this network you are talking about." ;-)  It is kind of like talking 
about the email network.

Basically, SIP exchanges are always private exchanges between two endpoints 
on the IP network as you say in the first paragraph.
:-)

As for work going on for restricting users' choice,  this should *not* be a 
work item for the SIP WG charter.  I can think of at least one regulatory 
agency that would be interested in hearing more about this work. :-\

I beleive until the bis obsoletes RFC 2543, the latter is the authoratative
word on SIP.  Most of the changes made to the bis are backwards compatible,
except for a couple of places; to wit, some headers (R-R, for instance) in
the bis can accept additional parameters (rr-param) which may cause a strict
RFC 2543 parser to choke.  Also, the bis adds some new response codes; "487
Request Terminated" springs to mind...

I would have to add a grain of salt to this and add that the bug fixes in
bis02 should be followed, as they are obvious fixes to real problems found
in the current RFC. Other than that the RFC should be adhered to, IMHO.

Folks,

As discussed during the sip working group interim meeting, I have formed a
mailing list for discussions of aaa architectures and requirements in
support of sip enabled systems. You can find information, subscribe, and so
on, at:

http://mailman.dynamicsoft.com/mailman/listinfo/sip-aaa

The purpose of the list is to have technical discussions, not to continue
the endless argument about which working group is responsible for owning the
items. I, as a member of the technical community interested in building
complete solutions based on sip, believe this is an important subject to
work on, no matter where it takes place. I think others agree. This list can
serve as a forum for having those discussions.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Hi,

Again, I am Gonzalo, but I will also comment... :)

My personal opinion is that, even if this overlap dialing thing seems
like a very difficult problem to solve, the functionality itself is
pretty minor, so I don't think that a UA should have to negotiate about
the method to use for this... Also, I don't think your negotiation
proposal would work. You should remember that you have to reach the UAS
before you can do this negotiation in the first place, which means you
may have to send a number of INVITEs, and receive 484 responses from
proxies. And, even when you reach the UAS (let's assume it's a PSTN
gateway), it may be able to forward the digits, so the only answer you
are going to get is 100 - which you will get from the first proxy, so
the UAS can't include the negotiation result there. 

This response-from-the-UAS thing is, however, related to another issue
which I will describe in another mail.

See my comment above why I don't this would work very well.

Well, well, well... Let's assume it's a proxy that sends the 484
response. Then, if you want to start using INFO, this proxy must
remember the INVITE, and collect the INFOs. Then, when the proxy has
enough digits, what shall it do then? Create an INVITE of it's own? What
will then happen when the UAC receive the response for an INVITE it
never created? Also, when the proxy sends the INVITE, it may receive 484
responses from the NEXT proxy in the network, asking for more digits.
Ie, your proxy would have to both collect digits from the UAC, and
handle the next entity (in this example, another proxy) in the SIP
nework. All this would DEFINITELY hurt existing implementations, so you
would also have to negotiate with the proxies if they are able to do
this...

In this case I think Keith's proposal, ie that the proxy is smart enough
to see that the only thing that has changed in the new INVITE is the
receiver digits, is MUCH easier to implement :)

I agree, routing is a problem, but there has been proposals to solve it,
ie the one Keith gave. Also, I think that routing, and forking, is the
reason for a number of SIP related problems, so I think it is better to
find a generic solution to that. Allowing ROUTE headers in specific
situations (again, see Keith's proposal) in initial requests is partly a
solution.

I see no reason why you would keep the PRACK alive, since you have
canceled your setup request. The problem is that if you simply kill your
transaction the UAS is going to re-transmit the 18x response until
timeout. One answer would be to also CANCEL to PRACK, but that is
related to the issue about if CANCEL is allowed for other requests than
INVITE...

Also, you have a similar case if you receive the final respones to your
INVITE while you still have ongoing PRACK transactions. Why would you
then want to keep the PRACK transactions alive, since you (the UAC)
KNOWS you have received the provisional responses (otherwise you would
never have started the PRACK transaction), and you already have received
the final response? I think that CANCEL should be used here.

Also (I have a number of issues on PRACK :), what should the UAS do, if
it get triggered to send a final response to the INVITE it received, but
it is still sending 18x provisional responses it hasn't received a PRACK
for? Maybe this is more an implementation issue, but I wanted to point
it out.

This is also an issue. It is related to what I just wrote, but the
difference is that now the UAS hasn't received a CANCEL, but it has
still sent the final response to the INVITE.

My personal opinion about PRACK is that it is a little weird to spend
more resources to ack provisional responses, (PRACK request + response)
than to ack the final response (only an ACK request), but I guess that
is not related to your question, so... :)

  I agree with you. However, the 100Rel draft states that CANCEL of
  PRACK is not valid.

 You are correct in that it does not seem to be the best use of resources to keep
  the PRACK's going. However,  since CANCEL is not allowed can I assume that
  server will stop 18x retransmission at this point? May need to allow PRACKs to
  complete.

   Given the way the 100rel draft is currently written I suspect that you
  need to allow the PRACKs to continue.

   The 100rel draft does recommend that the UAS not send the next provisional
   response until it the previous one is acknowledged.  If this is the case, then
   you could drop unsent provisional responses at the UAS if it was determined
  that a final response was to be sent. This works if media is sent in first
  provisional response or in the final response. If however, media could be
  in one of the dropped provisional responses you could have a problem.

Hi,

I started a separate thread on this, since I assume two things:

1. We only use INVITEs for the overlap dialing

2. The INVITE has reached the UAS, in this case a PSTN gateway.


Ok, as long as the gateway UAS doesn't have enough digits to forward the
call to the next entity it will send 484 responses. No problem there.

But, when it does find the next PSTN entity, the following issues come
up:

1. The gateway can not send a final response to the INVITE, since it
doesn't know what it is, IF is is, going to receive from ISUP. The
proxies on the path, and the UAC, will probably receive a 100
provisional responses, that will extend the re-transmission timer.
However, these re-transmissions are not necessary, and they MAY even end
up in another gateway, when we come back to the routing issue, and the
issue of multiple IAMs.

So, I would again like to raise the 186 issue. Ie, the UAS gateway could
send a "186 Call Routed Forward" provisional response which, IF the
proxies and the UAC supports it, would stop the re-transmission. Yes,
there may have been a re-transmission before the 186 is received, but at
least the chance of the problems above to occur is smaller. If the UAC
also is a gateway, this provisional response would not trigger any ISUP
message, it would simply be used for the SIP part of the gateway to stop
the re-transmission.

2. The call is routed to the end PSTN user, and the gateway receives a
an ISUP indication for that. Now, it generates a 200 OK for the previous
INVITE. BUT, what final response does it send to all the other existing
INVITE transactions, which arrived earlier, and did NOT trigger a 484
response since the gateway managed to route them to the next PSTN
entity? I don't think 200 OK is a good idea, because it may mess things
up at the UAC gateway (which has to map the "correct" 200 OK into an
ISUP message), and it is also against the statement that 200 OK
indicates that the call has been succesfully routed. Yes, in this case
it HAS been, but only for one call-leg, ie for the latest INVITE. The
closest I can think of is 484, but I don't know that is a good idea
either. 

For example, what happens if one of the 484 reaches the UAC gateway
before the 200 OK? The UAC gateway will realise it doesn't have more
digits, so it will release the call - unless, of course, it is smart
enough to know that it has sent a newer INVITE, with more digits. Again,
like with the 186 provisional response, some kind of final response
which will not be mapped into ISUP, or affect the call in any other way,
would be good? A final response only to "get rid" of the INVITE
transactions we don't care about anymore. 

In Dallas, a 202 response was proposed for another case, and maybe that
could be here too? A response that simply says: "Ok, your INVITE was
fine, but we don't need it anymore. So, please terminate it but don't
make a big noise about it".

Hi,

186 is not needed because we have already 183 means session progress.

Since the gateway knows that the last INVITE was successful, it can
safely answer 484 to all the previous transactions. No new response code
needed.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Christer,

I think this is being made a lot more complicated than necessary.

By negotiation, I just meant that when the call reached a UAS which
supported INFOs, it would return an indication (e.g. 186)that the UAC could
switch to using INFOs. Until the call reached the UAS (i.e. PSTN Gateway),
then INFOs would not be used - you would just have INVITE/484 exchanges
until you had enough digits to reach the UAS.

For proxies which need to see all the digits, they can still operate in
INVITE/484 mode until they have enough digits to route - the proxy would not
trigger the UAC to send INFOs, but if a downstream UAS *did*, the proxy
could examine subsequent INFOs which come past in order to update its record
of the destination number.

Regards...Mark

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Christer,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think this is being made a lot more complicated =
than necessary.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>By negotiation, I just meant that when the call =
reached a UAS which supported INFOs, it would return an indication =
(e.g. 186)that the UAC could switch to using INFOs. Until the call =
reached the UAS (i.e. PSTN Gateway), then INFOs would not be used - you =
would just have INVITE/484 exchanges until you had enough digits to =
reach the UAS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>For proxies which need to see all the digits, they =
can still operate in INVITE/484 mode until they have enough digits to =
route - the proxy would not trigger the UAC to send INFOs, but if a =
downstream UAS *did*, the proxy could examine subsequent INFOs which =
come past in order to update its record of the destination =
number.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;Gonzalo,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;I don't understand your comment about the =
INFO Overlap proposals</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;causing problems for 'vanilla' SIP UAs. My =
suggestion was </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that the use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;of INFOs for overlap digits be negotiated =
between UAC and UAS.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; My personal opinion is that, even if this =
overlap dialing thing seems</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; like a very difficult problem to solve, the =
functionality itself is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; pretty minor, so I don't think that a UA should =
have to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; negotiate about</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the method to use for this... Also, I don't =
think your negotiation</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proposal would work. You should remember that =
you have to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; reach the UAS</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; before you can do this negotiation in the first =
place, which means you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; may have to send a number of INVITEs, and =
receive 484 responses from</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxies. And, even when you reach the UAS =
(let's assume it's a PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; gateway), it may be able to forward the digits, =
so the only answer you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; are going to get is 100 - which you will get =
from the first proxy, so</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the UAS can't include the negotiation result =
there. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; This response-from-the-UAS thing is, however, =
related to another issue</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; which I will describe in another mail.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;So, the UAC would include a 'Supported' tag =
if it could do overlap</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;INFOs and the mechanism would then only be =
used if both ends </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; supported</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;it. Otherwise you would just kill session =
requests without enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;digits with 484s.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; See my comment above why I don't this would =
work very well.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;Regarding Application Servers, the INFOs =
should certainly contain all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;the digits so far (otherwise we get the =
problems with lost messages).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;I do not believe any proxies exist which =
are being used today in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;overlap situations and which need access to =
the whole called number,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;so we can add this capability to the =
specification without </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; hurting any</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;existing implementations.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Well, well, well... Let's assume it's a proxy =
that sends the 484</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; response. Then, if you want to start using =
INFO, this proxy must</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; remember the INVITE, and collect the INFOs. =
Then, when the proxy has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; enough digits, what shall it do then? Create an =
INVITE of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it's own? What</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; will then happen when the UAC receive the =
response for an INVITE it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; never created? Also, when the proxy sends the =
INVITE, it may </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; receive 484</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; responses from the NEXT proxy in the network, =
asking for more digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Ie, your proxy would have to both collect =
digits from the UAC, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; handle the next entity (in this example, =
another proxy) in the SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; nework. All this would DEFINITELY hurt existing =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; implementations, so you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; would also have to negotiate with the proxies =
if they are able to do</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; this...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; In this case I think Keith's proposal, ie that =
the proxy is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; smart enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to see that the only thing that has changed in =
the new INVITE is the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; receiver digits, is MUCH easier to implement =
:)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;Finally, there are many reasons other than =
simple load balancing why</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;one INVITE might be routed differently to a =
subsequent, apparently</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;identical, one. e.g. Time of day routing - =
which is certainly not</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;'random'. Stateful proxies may also =
remember where they sent the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;INVITE so that subsequent requests on the =
same call leg can be routed</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;the same way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I agree, routing is a problem, but there has =
been proposals </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to solve it,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ie the one Keith gave. Also, I think that =
routing, and forking, is the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; reason for a number of SIP related problems, so =
I think it is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; better to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; find a generic solution to that. Allowing ROUTE =
headers in specific</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; situations (again, see Keith's proposal) in =
initial requests </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; is partly a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; solution.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ordered delivery could be =

Application Servers. How you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; resolve the technical issues related =
to INFO does not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; really matter</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; me. It is not &quot;vanilla&quot; =
SIP, and I am against this kind of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; non-standard</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My reason for exploring the use =
of INFO is not to save on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; messages. It is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do with the issue of source =
routing. Again, my concern of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; source</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; routing is not one of a =
technical nature. What if an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; administration has a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; security policy that states =
source routing (a ROUTE header in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an initial INVITE) will not take =
place in its SIP network</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; but it also requires</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same network interworks with =
the PSTN; if any part of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the PSTN interworking</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanism</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relies on source routing then =
there is a conflict of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements. It is this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conflict</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wish to address.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, let's address this. Source =
routing is proposed in the draft to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; address load balancing. This is, a =
proxy that sends INVITEs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; to different</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; egrees gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if an IAM and one SAM are =
received, the second INVITE </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; might end</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; up</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; in another gateway than the fist =
INVITE. This would trigger 2 IAMs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of 1 IAM and 1 SAM.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, this is the problem that has to =
be solved. What I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; wanted to say</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the draft (I did not have lot of time =
and it has to be rephrased),</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; was</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the following:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is strongly RECOMMENDED that =
proxies route requests that are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; basically identical and just differ =
in the to field (more</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; digits) in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; same way. So, if such as proxy =
performs load balancing, all the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent INVITEs will reach the =
same egrees gateway.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not difficult to do, because =
most likely a call to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; +1234 has to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; be routed in the same way as a call =
to +12345. So, the only real</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement in that proxies do not =
make routing decisions based on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; random variables (such as internal =
clocks).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then, just in case folks did not feel =
comfortable with </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; this solution</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; (which I believe is the good one), I =
outlined the source routing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; solution.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; And what about load balancing? You =
can still have load balancing.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Your</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; proxy makes the routing decision =
based on to, from, and what</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; ever fields</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; it wants. Then, it can calculate a =
digest of some fields, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and make a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;random&quot; routing decision =
based on that hash. This provides load</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; balancing but still routes INVITEs =
carrying SAMs in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proper way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this resolve your issue?</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jonathan Rosenberg wrote:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think the correct answer =
about which approach to use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; (INFO vs. multiple</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call legs) depends on your =
view of the scope of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; address within the sip</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cloud. If you believe that =
the sip role has ended once</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; you have enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digits to select an egress =
gateway (which may be as few</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; as one, i.e., +1</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selects a US gateway), then =
the sip address of that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; gateway can be viewed as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sip:+1@provider.com, and =
all subsequent digits are PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; issues, outside the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scope of SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I definitively agree that this =
is the view that INFO fans</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; have of a SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cloud. What I am saying is that =
this view is wrong. This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; usage of SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; falls outside the scope of =
SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If they want to use SIP for =
locating a gateway,&nbsp; it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; fine. But after</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the gateway has been located, =
let's use another method for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; transporting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ISUP signalling.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's assume that I get an IAM =
with &quot;+1&quot;, as Jonathan </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; says in his</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example. Then the INVITE =
generated by the gateway will reach the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; US</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gateway. Now, the mission of SIP =
has finished, since the gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been located. Why don't we put =
in the body of this INVITE a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; session</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; description that comprises a =
media session and a SIGTRAN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; session? This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way we would have established =
these two sessions between</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the gateways</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and all the subsequent ISUP =
messages would be sent over the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; SIGTRAN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find that the usage of SIP =
that I have just described would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; OK.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I do not understand is why =
folks want to use SIP for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; transporting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent ISUP messages. SIP =
does not have good transport</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; properties</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (big overhead, it can run over =
UDP...). Besides, it does not</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ordered delivery.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the INVITE has Cseq=3D1 and =
the next message that the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; egrees gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receives is a INFO with =
Cseq=3D7... what should the gateway do?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there were several proxies in =
the middle asking for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; credentials for the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO, so the ingrees gateway had =
to add authentication</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff and resend</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the INFO. If this was the case, =
the SAM contained in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; INFO would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the second digit of the called =
party number... However, maybe 5</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages got lost, and the SAM =
that we have received in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; body of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO makes no sense without the =
previous ones because is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the 7th digit</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the number...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not usually a problem in =
SIP, since all </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; messages have full</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. However, using INFO for =
sending SAMs breaks this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; rule, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore it breaks the SIP =
model.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that considering that =
the session is established after</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first INVITE and sending the =
following SAMs using INFO is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; making one of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mistakes described in the =
guidelines for SIP authors:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We need to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transport ISUP signalling over =
IP between two gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Both gateways</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already implement SIP... why do =
we have to implement</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; another protocol?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's use SIP to transport ISUP =
signalling&quot;. We are just</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIP for this just because it =
would save implementing yet another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in the gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I strongly disagree with this =
usage of SIP. SIP-T is good</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; as long as the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIP cloud provides services. If =
not, SIP-T is not a good</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; protocol for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transporting ISUP =
signalling.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>

sip role encompasses functions that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might apply to the PSTN =
subscribers, then you need to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; have the entire</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still I want to have =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; If the call is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addresed to the phone =
number 1234, I want to have a to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; field that says</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1234. I do not care if =
there is a leg routed thru the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; PSTN and another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thru SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carrying full state is =
one of the beauties of SIP. If</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; we begin using</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO for this, it =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Differen names, the</FONT>

want to re-create ISUP using SIP. I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, if a proxy is =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will want to see the =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the proper</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like to use SIP =

Hi all,

Are any transcripts of the interim meeting of last week available
somewhere on the Internet? I assumed some of the discussed issues
would show up on this list, but I haven't seen anything about it.
I'm especially interested in any decisions/clarifications/new problems
related to the REFER issue.

If anybody knows where I can find transcripts of the 8-9 February
meeting, please tell the list. I'm sure I'm not the only one interested.

Regards,

/Jacco

The 'network' consisting of the SIP proxies and the relationships between
them. Perhaps 'network' is not the right term.

Yes, by which you would mean SMTP servers and the relationships between
them.

If the SIP 'exchanges' are owned by a third party (i.e. not one of the
parties between whom the session is being set up), and the service offered
by them is offered publically (i.e. to anyone with enough $$$), then I think
they could be considered 'publically available telecommunications systems',
not private systems.

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The term &quot;public network&quot; has =
regulatory implications in most </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; countries.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Oh yes.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; As you say, SIP runs end-to-end over an IP =
infrastructure.&nbsp; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; It can run </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; between two endpoints that also terminate the =
RTP stream (e.g., &quot;SIP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; phones&quot;) or it can run between a SIP UA =
and a proxy/redirect/etc. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; server.&nbsp; Either way, the two IP hosts =
running SIP are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; endpoints on the IP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; network and (may) have a customer relationship =
with the IP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; network provider </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (i.e., not belong to the IP access =
provider).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; In this case, I may go Christian's question one =
step further </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and ask&nbsp; &quot;what </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; is this network you are talking about.&quot; =
;-)&nbsp; </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The 'network' consisting of the SIP proxies and the =
relationships between them. Perhaps 'network' is not the right =
term.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>It is kind of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; like talking </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; about the email network.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Yes, by which you would mean SMTP servers and the =
relationships between them.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Basically, SIP exchanges are always private =
exchanges between </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; two endpoints </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; on the IP network as you say in the first =
paragraph.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; :-)</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>If the SIP 'exchanges' are owned by a third party =
(i.e. not one of the parties between whom the session is being set up), =
and the service offered by them is offered publically (i.e. to anyone =
with enough $$$), then I think they could be considered 'publically =
available telecommunications systems', not private systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; As for work going on for restricting users' =
choice,&nbsp; this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; should *not* be a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; work item for the SIP WG charter.&nbsp; </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The very thought!</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;I can think of at least </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; one regulatory </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; agency that would be interested in hearing more =
about this work. :-\</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;The public network will likely be =
trusted in the sense that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it promises </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;to obey the user's stated privacy =
requirements, indeed Data </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Protection </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;legislation will usually oblige the =
public network provider </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to do this. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, it will likely be a requirement =
of the public service that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;terminals identify themselves in some =
way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;I do not think it likely that for =
Emergency calls, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; terminals/networks </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;will behave differently with respect to =
identity </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; information than for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;normal calls except that it will =
probably not be considered an </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;infringement of privacy to deliver =
identity information to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; an Emergency </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;call centre even when the user has =
requested it be kept private.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;More complex is how does the public =
service provider verify </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the identity </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;and location information ? In the =
example above, the public service </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;provider can only be sure of the owner =
of the Enterprise </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; network from </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;which the call came, and this may not =
translate into a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; single geographic </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;location. The network would be forced =
to send forward only the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;&gt;'unverified' location information =
provided by the caller.</FONT>

Hi,

I'm having difficulty in understanding the following from RFC2327, SDP.

     "When a list of payload formats is given, this implies that all of
     these formats may be used in the session, but the first of these
     formats is the default format for the session." -- SDP Standards Track,
page 20.

What does default mean here?

When a m-line reads as "m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 3 4 5", does this mean that
the remote UA will be requested to use GSM (PT 3) if it could support it and
if it didn't support GSM, the local UA will negotiate for G723 (PT 4) with
the remote UA and so on? (It's clear that I need to understand the above
phrase!).

Thanks for your help and valuable time.

Regards,

--victor

All,

The notes from the meeting earlier this month seem to indicate an agreement
to deprecate early media i.e. to include a SHOULD NOT in respect of media
before the 200 OK of the INVITE.

Is this a correct understanding of what was agreed ?

I seem to remember this issue being discussed extensively on this list late
last year and there were strong feelings expressed against changing the
semantics of the 200 response to the INVITE. Presently it corresponds to
called party answer, but the change above would alter this.

Was a solution to these concerns also identified at the meeting ?

Does this deprecation apply to the setting up of the media path before 200
OK for QoS assurance, or just when the intention is to play the backwards
media to the caller ?

Regards,

Mark Watson

Jonathan,

Sorry for the delay.  This answers your questions
if you are still interested.

I agree multipart is bad.   The current draft
does not use multipart.  http://phonectl.sfour.com/

At the time of your writing it had already been discussed on 
the list that continuing audio to the HANDOFF/MOVE sender
should not be possible.  Thus, no SDP in the 
HANDOFF, but it still modifies the
media session which you probably won't like.  The motivation
is moving one end of a two-party call-leg.  Continuing media
to the old end point makes no sense.

As a general rule I do favor SDP in all SIP messages.  It makes
managing the media stream easier for implementations.  Your chatty
preference works fine in nice network conditions with
fast hosts (i.e. two PCs, same idle eithernet), but when things get
bad, the chatty technique goes to hell.  Add half a second for
each retry.  Add some more packets for authentication.  Lengthen
the sequence.  Increase latency.  Disallow overlapping transactions.  
My human customers will notice the delay.   

Of all the arguements my business team hates to hear, "The delay
has to be that long because the protocol requires it."  Then they
call the protocol broken.  They are right

SDP in non-INVITES helps make actions *atomic*.  I

The referred-by equivalent is for the transferee's protection.  If the
transferor and targe wish to authenticate each other with additional
headers, they are free to.  The security is just as good/bad as REFER,
that if I can snoop packets I can forge messages and hijack connections.
MOVE requests are only honored when received in call-legs
which are established.

Mis-use?  My code is much easier.  vs. what? protocol beauty.
More messages suck for end point complexity, round trip delay,
error cases, etc.

Multiple (thus overlapping) MOVEs do not make sense, and should not 
be permitted.  This guideline will be mentioned to the draft.  Thanks.

"If the triggered generates a 300 which recursed by the transferee then 400"
the transferee decides which code to return.  Mandating reports
fouls a privacy issue.

Hmmmm... I had not thought about warning headers.  Is there a reason
why they couldn't also be included in the INVITE?  privacy permitting
of course.

If the transferor sends the BYE to the target, then
the target may have some time when he must support two simultaneous
connections, but this is a unnecessisary difficult requirement.  

The HANDOFF/MOVE draft does not mandate he sends a BYE, but
the replaces is requesting him to.  Your beef is with the Replaces
draft.  I believe this behavior will be used with REFER.

Okay, how about the name "MOVE"?

Early mediaGee, I HOPE not.

Real world scenarios -- my office uses only SIP phones with a PSTN =
gateway for outside communications. The first "hello" is almost =
universally clipped. Most annoying.

My recollection of recent discussion of basic call flows (no special =
"early media") is that the UAC SHOULD be ready to receive media at the =
time the INVITE is transmitted. It SHOULD not send media until after it =
has sent ACK in response to a 200 OK.

  All,=20

  The notes from the meeting earlier this month seem to indicate an =
agreement to deprecate early media i.e. to include a SHOULD NOT in =

  Is this a correct understanding of what was agreed ?=20

  I seem to remember this issue being discussed extensively on this list =
late last year and there were strong feelings expressed against changing =
the semantics of the 200 response to the INVITE. Presently it =
corresponds to called party answer, but the change above would alter =
this.

  Was a solution to these concerns also identified at the meeting ?=20

  Does this deprecation apply to the setting up of the media path before =
200 OK for QoS assurance, or just when the intention is to play the =

Hi all,
please forgive me if this is an inappropriate distribution. I would like to
know how to get hold on drafts for SIP 3G wireless extension. thanks

The SDP in the sender's message indicates its capabilities and
where any recipients (of the message) are to send the media to. In 
the above case, the sender is indicating it can handle any of 3 different 
media formats all on the same port (49230).  The recipient is free to 
send one or more of the three formats listed.  (I wonder how often a m= 
line like above will be seen in practice.  The COTS hw and sw I'm familiar 
with can't handle multiple simultaneous media encoding formats on a 
single port, or even switching encoding format without being told.)

There is no subsequent media negotiation in SIP in a single session 
establishment request.  Each party "declares" what media formats it 
can support.  Now UAs can negotiate media format in separate session 
establish requests.  One way is for the UAS to respond to an INVITE 
with 415.  The requestor can send another INVITE with a different 
media format and see if the other end accepts it.  Another way is 
for the UAS to accept the request and send a reINVITE with a 
different SDP.

This is my understanding of SDP and its use in SIP.  Others may 
respond if I'm mistaken.

regards,
Bert

FYI, these are some of the SIP mobility drafts submitted in IETF recently.
There are other useful resources like

SIP mobility Paper by Henning and Elin Wedlund which can be found at :

Emami-Nouri,

The 3G community is still working on understanding how it will be used in
their networks. I believe that 3GPP (GSM) may be a little farther ahead than
3GPP2 (CDMA), who last year finished their All-IP architecture and
requirements specification, which relies quite heavily on SIP.

For access to 3GPP2 specifications, please see
www.cdma-2000.org/draft-3gpp2-collaboration-00.txt. The I-D was recently
approved by the 3GPP2 steering commitee, and wil be available on the IETF
archives in a couple of days. There is a similar 3GPP document, which is
available at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-3gpp-collaboration-00.txt.
 Currently, one of the big work items is to try to define the AAA requirements
for SIP in these networks. A group of people that participate heavily in 3GPP
and 3GPP2 have submitted our first revision for such a document, which can be
found at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-calhoun-sip-aaa-reqs-01.txt.

I believe that the 3G folks will be submitting additional Internet Drafts as
their work continues, but for the moment the best place to find this
information is through their respective web sites.

Please let me know if you need additional information,

PatC

Greetings

Mark Watson posted his updated comments on the privacy draft a couple of
weeks ago. Since then, there was some good discussion which seems to
have settled down now. With the I-D submission deadline approaching, I'd
like to get some closure on this in the (perhaps naive) hope that we can
get this WG item finished.

Mark's overall comment on the privacy draft was that we should make
Remote-Party-ID more general so that it can be used for any type of
identity information. One of the key points here is, that the types of
identity information should be extensible and hence can be used for new
types of identity not defined in the draft. I think this is a good idea
and I've seen no disagreement on this so we should accept that as our
goal.

Mark also suggested five specific enhancements (see
http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2001q1/005470.html for
details):
1) Requlatory requirements
2) Types of Party
3) Types of Identity
4) Handling of Privacy Requirements
5) Location Information

I've seen no disagreement on 1-4, so we should incorporate these.

Location Information generated a lot of discussion though and seemed to
be controversial. Based on the comments it seems unlikely that we will
be able to solve this one any time soon, however, it's also not clear
that it needs to be part of the privacy draft. First of all, location
information is not a requirement for all applications of
Remote-Party-ID, e.g. non primary-line telephony or in general just
non-telephony, which however may still want to use Remote-Party-ID.
Secondly, since we will be generalizing the Remote-Party-ID and make it
extensible, a URL-based solution could still make use of it for Location
Information, but again, I don't see this as an integral part of this
extension. Thus, I propose that the specifics of Location Information
will not be part of the privacy draft.


Assuming nobody objects, I will work with Mark on updating the draft
accordingly, so please speak up now if you disagree with any of this.


Thanks

       Flemming

Hi,

Ok, so this is basically Tom's ogiginal proposal.

So, I guess we all can agree on the fact that until we reach the UAS, we
use INVITEs and 484 responses.

I still agree that there are advantages using INFO. However, using INFO
still raises some issues.

Consider the case where the INVITE reaches the UAS, which DOES manage to
route the call to the next PSTN entity. To inform the UAC about this
(this is true BOTH if we use INVITEs or INFOs for the rest of the
digits) the UAS sends a 18x response. In the INFO-case, the UAS include
the "INFO negotiation" result in this response. However:

1. Before the UAC receives the 18x response, it may receive additional
digits, and will send a new INVITE. In this case, the UAS must be able
to handle new INVITEs, EVEN if it has indicated in the 18x response that
it does support the method using INFOs. This case will not happen if the
UAC always will wait for a response before it sends the next request,
INVITE or INFO, but that may slow down the call setup, AND digig
buffering must be implemented.

2. Since the UAS may not support the method using INFO, the UAC may
still have to use INVITEs for the additional digits. 

Conclusion: No matter which method we want to use, both the UAC and UAS
must be able to use both methods, and, like I mentioned, the UAS may
have to process additional INVITEs even if it has sent a 18x response
and indicated the support for INFO.

So, from this point of view I think it costs more than it gains by using
INFO. Also, if we define rules for the routing the gain is even less.
The only case where I (this is my personal opinion) could agree it makes
any sense at all to use INFO is when the UAC always waits for a response
from the UAS before it sends the next request, but do we really want to
require that? And, if we solve the routing issue in a nice way I don't
think it's worth the effort - even if we also don't have to send ACKs by
using INFO.

Hi,

I have a couple of questions about the t.38 call flow draft. I looked at
the fax discussions in the archieve, but I could not find anything
related to this. It is, however, related to SDP in general, so if it has
been discussed I would be happy if someone could point me to the thread
(and, hopefully, the solution :)

1. F11 INVITE IFTGW UA -> PROXY

In this re-INVITE we add the fax stream to the call. However, t.38 for
SIP recommendation it says that the existing voice stream should remain,
so shouldn't the original voice parameters (m line etc) be included in
the re-INVITE SDP?

2. This questions is depending on the first.

Like I said, the recommendation says that the existing voice stream
should remain, but that it should be muted during the fax transmission.
The problem is that SDP uses the c line, which is for the WHOLE call
(not a single stream), to mute stream(s), so I wonder if it will be
possible to do this on a protocol level, or if it has to be in the
implementation?

Christer Holmberg

My understanding of 'default' in this context is "I support all of the
following payload types, but I prefer using the first one".  Please comment
if this is a wrong interpretation.

Indeed. But to answer the original question, there is no requirement to
encapsulate BICC in SIP - this does not make sense.

BICC consists of two logical parts, (i) ISUP messages (which support the
narrowband ISDN/PSTN service set) and (ii) Bearer Information (which
controls the setup of the bearer connection across the ATM/IP network).

SIP-T consists of three logical parts, (i) ISUP messages (ii) Bearer
Information (in the form of SDP) and (iii) SIP headers (supporting
integration with native SIP networks.

Therefore SIP-T is already a superset of BICC. Encapsulating BICC inside
SIP-T would just result in duplicating the Bearer Information. So, in the
BICC-SIP-BICC case, the SIP messages will look just like the ISUP-SIP-ISUP
ones. When you subtract the bearer information from a BICC message, you are
essentially left with an ISUP one.

In fact, for IP networks, BICC just about uses SDP to carry the Bearer
Information, so it should interwork to SIP without *too* much difficulty
(but don't quote me on that).

Mark

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I also see BICC-SIP-ISUP and of =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Seems prejudicial in favor of SIP catering =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; about:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; SIP-BICC-SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I think we should request the BICC guys to =
be able to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; encapsulate SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; messages. After all, what about service =
transparency across </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; my SIP network!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; All these operators that are deploying SIP =
are doing so, in </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; part, because of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the service possibilities. Shall I be =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; capabilities when</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; I traverse an IP based BICC network? Why =
do the BICC guys </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; get to keep their</FONT>

all, BICC is even </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; newer than SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Of course, once we do that, the more fun =
case is:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; ISUP-SIP-BICC-SIP-ISUP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; in which case the encapsulated SIP =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; messages, both of which are encapsulated =
in BICC.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Of course, we should probably also =
consider the case of:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; SIP-ISUP-SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Think about it; a SIP phone calls a PSTN =
number. It goes to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; an ss7 gateway.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Turns out, that this number is then =
forwarded to another </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; number, and that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; number is a VoIP terminal. So, it exits at =
another gateway, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and hits the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; terminal. I suppose we should also request =
the ISUP guys to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; encapsulate SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; messages.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; Now then, we should also probably consider =

It's all in the definitions.
 
If I have two BICC systems, with a SIP system in the middle, I have several
simple goals
    1.  I want the call to proceed (that is, I want it to work)
    2.  In support of #1, I want the BICC messages the enter the SIP system
to be preserved across
            the sip message stream (which, btw, would include the new
message BICC introduces,
            and the new IE that BICC introduces)
    3. Also in support of #1, I want the bearer to work.  Here I have two
choices, depending on
            how I build my network.  I could have gateways between the BICC
networks and the
            SIP networks.  In this case, there are 3 bearer segments, and
thus the SIP network
            bearer is from the entry GW to the exit GW.  This would be the
case if there were
            a bearer change (ATM to IP for example).  In these cases, the
bearer descriptions
            change across the network boundaries.
 
            I could also have one big IP network, in which case the SIP
network has to just carry
            the SDP from the originating network to the terminating network
(and allow traffic
            in case of firewalls and NAT devices).
 
So, what does that mean to the drafts?
 
One is that the SIP-ISUP interwork document has to include the BICC messages
and IEs
that are not in base ISUP
 
Another is that we need a document describing how the bearers work in the
two cases 
above.  
 
The ISUP MIME type doesn't change, and the INFO method doesn't change.
 
Brian

Indeed. But to answer the original question, there is no requirement to
encapsulate BICC in SIP - this does not make sense.

BICC consists of two logical parts, (i) ISUP messages (which support the
narrowband ISDN/PSTN service set) and (ii) Bearer Information (which
controls the setup of the bearer connection across the ATM/IP network).

SIP-T consists of three logical parts, (i) ISUP messages (ii) Bearer
Information (in the form of SDP) and (iii) SIP headers (supporting
integration with native SIP networks.

Therefore SIP-T is already a superset of BICC. Encapsulating BICC inside
SIP-T would just result in duplicating the Bearer Information. So, in the
BICC-SIP-BICC case, the SIP messages will look just like the ISUP-SIP-ISUP
ones. When you subtract the bearer information from a BICC message, you are
essentially left with an ISUP one.

In fact, for IP networks, BICC just about uses SDP to carry the Bearer
Information, so it should interwork to SIP without *too* much difficulty
(but don't quote me on that).

Mark

  <P><FONT size=2>Indeed. But to answer the original question, there is no 
  requirement to encapsulate BICC in SIP - this does not make sense.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>BICC consists of two logical parts, (i) ISUP messages (which 
  support the narrowband ISDN/PSTN service set) and (ii) Bearer Information 
  (which controls the setup of the bearer connection across the ATM/IP 
  network).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>SIP-T consists of three logical parts, (i) ISUP messages (ii) 
  Bearer Information (in the form of SDP) and (iii) SIP headers (supporting 
  integration with native SIP networks.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>Therefore SIP-T is already a superset of BICC. Encapsulating 
  BICC inside SIP-T would just result in duplicating the Bearer Information. So, 
  in the BICC-SIP-BICC case, the SIP messages will look just like the 
  ISUP-SIP-ISUP ones. When you subtract the bearer information from a BICC 
  message, you are essentially left with an ISUP one.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>In fact, for IP networks, BICC just about uses SDP to carry 
  the Bearer Information, so it should interwork to SIP without *too* much 
  difficulty (but don't quote me on that).</FONT></P>

  &gt; &gt; And is it just me, or is the idea that BICC will be</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encapsulated in SIP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat counterintuitive? Are there any services today 
  that</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require that?</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, if there is interest I'd be 
  inclined to say that BICC</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should 
  have</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's own MIME type which 
  should be discussed on its own merits.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, SIP-T is used for, among other 
  things, ISUP-SIP-ISUP.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; You don't think 
  anyone wants to do BICC-SIP-BICC when SIP is</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; one operator's</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; network, and the 
  BICCs are two other operators?</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I also see BICC-SIP-ISUP and of course 
  ISUP-BICC-SIP-ISUP and</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  variations.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; Seems prejudicial in favor of SIP catering to BICC. If we 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; do this, what</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  about:</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  SIP-BICC-SIP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; I think we should request the BICC guys to be able to </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; encapsulate SIP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; messages. After 
  all, what about service transparency across </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; my 
  SIP network!</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; All these operators that are 
  deploying SIP are doing so, in </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; part, because 
  of</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; the service possibilities. Shall I be 
  forced to lose those </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; capabilities when</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; I traverse an IP based BICC network? Why do the 
  BICC guys </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; get to keep their</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; services, and the SIP guys don't? After all, BICC is even 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; newer than SIP.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; Of course, once we do that, the more fun 
  case is:</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  ISUP-SIP-BICC-SIP-ISUP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; in which case the encapsulated SIP messages themselves 
  contain ISUP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; messages, both of which are 
  encapsulated in BICC.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; &gt; Of course, we should probably also consider the case 
  of:</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  SIP-ISUP-SIP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; Think about it; a SIP phone calls a PSTN number. It goes to 
  </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; an ss7 gateway.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; 
  Turns out, that this number is then forwarded to another </FONT><BR><FONT 
  size=2>&gt; number, and that</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; number is a 
  VoIP terminal. So, it exits at another gateway, </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  and hits the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; terminal. I suppose we should 
  also request the ISUP guys to </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; encapsulate 
  SIP</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; messages.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt; 
  &gt; </FONT><BR><FONT size=2>&gt; &gt; Now then, we should also probably

My interpretation of the message flow (message contents) in the I-D is that
the egress gateway is replacing the audio stream with a T.38 stream since
the original m= line and parameters are replaced with t.38 data.  I guess
this effectively mutes the audio session :)

If the egress gateway wanted to mute the audio using the method defined in
the SIP RFC, it would have included both media descriptions and an
additional c= line for one of media descriptions.  By having a c= line in
the T.38 media description, the egress gateway could place the audio on hold
(using IP address of 0.0.0.0 in the main session description) and still have
the T.38 session.  SDP (RFC 2327) allows c= lines in media descriptions
(that only apply to the one media stream) which override c= lines in the
main session description.  A possibly more explicit session description
would not have a c= line in the general session description and c= lines in
each media description.

So RFC 2327 allows placing the audio on hold while the T.38 is active at the
protocol level.

Bert

True, and item (ii) should at least allow use of existing SIP or SDP. And I 
believe the ISUP is slightly modified in BICC so it isn't exactly ISUP as 
used over SS7.

I believe there is bearer information in the ISUP message carried by SIP-T 
as well.  It may just not apply to the IP network.

Except "just about uses" isn't the same as "uses".  Instead of using SIP or 
SDP (or even H.323), SG11 has invented a new protocol by adding 
request/response semantics into the SDP "a = " line and calling it the "IP 
Bearer Control Protocol."

This in addition to modifying H.248/Megaco to fit into their "architecture."

Hi,

Yes, that is true. The recommendation, however, says that the fax stream
should be ADDED to the connection, not REPLACE the voice stream.

It was my understanding from the T.38 on IP recommendation that this is
the way it should work. We should add the fax stream, and mute the voice
stream instead of removing it, ie using a separate c= lines for each
media stream. I don't want to free resources I've used for the voice
when transmitting the fax, since I will probably need them if I switch
back from fax to voice.

Hello Christer,

I see the authors of the I-D do mention using two m= lines in section 6.2,
but in the context of UDP port usage by a gateway.  But, as you point out,
their message contents in section 4.3 do not agree with their recommendation
in section 4.1 to mute the audio stream.

I too would not release audio resources if they might be needed once the fax
stream ends.  I guess we as application developers need to decide if we want
the protocol to indicate what media support is needed for a session whether
or not a particular media stream is constant.  Or do we leave it up to the
implementation to support the capability to restore audio without indication
in the protocol.  Being that the I-D promotes itself as a BCP, I would argue
that the session as described is a multi (two) media session so both media
descriptions should be present throughout the message exchange.  Or leave
the audio media description and add the fax media description in the
reINVITE sent by the egress gateway.  Although I can see a PSTN gateway not
knowing in advance that a fax will be sent so adding the fax media
description seems to be the best approach in this scenario.

Anyway, I've copied the authors so they can comment if they desire.

Regards,
Bert

Every new protocol costs a lot of money to introduce in the network and
needs a solid business case, such as new revenue that would not be possible
otherwise. Just my usual skeptical outlook on reincarnations of SS7 and
device control protocols...

True, and item (ii) should at least allow use of existing SIP or SDP. And I
believe the ISUP is slightly modified in BICC so it isn't exactly ISUP as
used over SS7.

I believe there is bearer information in the ISUP message carried by SIP-T
as well.  It may just not apply to the IP network.

Except "just about uses" isn't the same as "uses".  Instead of using SIP or
SDP (or even H.323), SG11 has invented a new protocol by adding
request/response semantics into the SDP "a = " line and calling it the "IP
Bearer Control Protocol."

This in addition to modifying H.248/Megaco to fit into their "architecture."

Hi,

Thanks for your comments!

I agree that there sure will raise a number of implementation issues
later, but first I would like to get the
recommendation and the call flows to "fit" each other :)

Oh yes. This is because SG11 believe in 'call/bearer separation' i.e. that
the setup of the bearer should be an autonomous process between Media
Gateways which operates independently of the Call Control layer. Kludging
SDP to do this, is, IMO, preferable to inventing something completely new or
using H.245.

In SIP, the semantics of the carried SDP are implicit in the messaging
carrying the SDP.

Indeed. We (Nortel) have been trying to prevent this, but there are those
within SG11 who insist that the interface being addressed is fundamentally
different from H.248/Megaco. Personally I am not convinced by this - the
deviations from H.248 are more to do with starting out with an ATM-specific
overall solution in BICC CS1. Broadly, H.248/Megaco can functionally do
everything which the new Q.1950 can do, though there are some generic
packages defined in Q.1950 which have wider application.

To achieve the SG11 architectural aims with standard H.248 would mean basing
transport of all bearer information in BICC on SDP - which is not how BICC
CS1 works. But anyway...

Christer,

Comments below. The intention was that the UAC should wait for a response
before sending a new INVITE. The response is either a 484 or an 'INFO
Negotiation' which allows more digits to be sent.

Any other response indicates that you've got all the digits.

Yep, you would need to wait for the response before sending more digits. If
you get a 484 from a non-overlap supporting device or a "INFO negotiation"
from an overlap-supporting device you can send the next digit(s). Any other
response means you've got enough digits now.

Digit buffering's required at an incoming PSTN gateway anyway - you can
always receive overlap digits before you've finished processing the IAM.

> 

No, a UAS which did not support overlap would just 484 any calls without
enough digits. The point of standardising the INFO mechanism would be to say
that any UAS which did not have dial-plan information (i.e. could not detect
end-of-dialling), and therefore needed overlap, would need to implement it.

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Comments below. The intention was that the UAC should =
wait for a response before sending a new INVITE. The response is either =
a 484 or an 'INFO Negotiation' which allows more digits to be =
sent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Any other response indicates that you've got all the =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Hi,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;I think this is being made a lot more =
complicated than necessary.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;By negotiation, I just meant that when the =
call reached a UAS which</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;supported INFOs, it would return an =
indication (e.g. 186)that the UAC</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;could switch to using INFOs. Until the call =
reached the UAS </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (i.e. PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;Gateway), then INFOs would not be used - =
you would just have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt;INVITE/484 exchanges until you had enough =
digits to reach the UAS.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Ok, so this is basically Tom's ogiginal =
proposal.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the UAS, we</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; use INVITEs and 484 responses.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I still agree that there are advantages using =
INFO. However, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; using INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; still raises some issues.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Consider the case where the INVITE reaches the =
UAS, which </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; DOES manage to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; route the call to the next PSTN entity. To =
inform the UAC about this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (this is true BOTH if we use INVITEs or INFOs =
for the rest of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits) the UAS sends a 18x response. In the =
INFO-case, the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; UAS include</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the &quot;INFO negotiation&quot; result in this =
response. However:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 1. Before the UAC receives the 18x response, it =
may receive additional</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; digits, and will send a new INVITE. In this =
case, the UAS must be able</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to handle new INVITEs, EVEN if it has indicated =
in the 18x </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; response that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it does support the method using INFOs. This =
case will not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; happen if the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; UAC always will wait for a response before it =
sends the next request,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INVITE or INFO, but that may slow down the call =
setup, AND digig</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; buffering must be implemented.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Yep, you would need to wait for the response before =
sending more digits. If you get a 484 from a non-overlap supporting =
device or a &quot;INFO negotiation&quot; from an overlap-supporting =
device you can send the next digit(s). Any other response means you've =
got enough digits now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Digit buffering's required at an incoming PSTN =
gateway anyway - you can always receive overlap digits before you've =
finished processing the IAM.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; 2. Since the UAS may not support the method =
using INFO, the UAC may</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; still have to use INVITEs for the additional =
digits. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>No, a UAS which did not support overlap would just =
484 any calls without enough digits. The point of standardising the =
INFO mechanism would be to say that any UAS which did not have =
dial-plan information (i.e. could not detect end-of-dialling), and =
therefore needed overlap, would need to implement it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Conclusion: No matter which method we want to =
use, both the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; UAC and UAS</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; must be able to use both methods, and, like I =
mentioned, the UAS may</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; have to process additional INVITEs even if it =
has sent a 18x response</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and indicated the support for INFO.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; So, from this point of view I think it costs =
more than it </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; gains by using</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INFO. Also, if we define rules for the routing =
the gain is even less.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The only case where I (this is my personal =
opinion) could </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; agree it makes</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; any sense at all to use INFO is when the UAC =
always waits for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; a response</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; from the UAS before it sends the next request, =
but do we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; really want to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; require that? And, if we solve the routing =
issue in a nice way I don't</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; think it's worth the effort - even if we also =
don't have to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; send ACKs by</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; using INFO.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't understand your comment =
about the INFO Overlap proposals</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;causing problems for 'vanilla' =
SIP UAs. My suggestion was</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of INFOs for overlap digits be =
negotiated between UAC and UAS.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; My personal opinion is that, even if =
this overlap dialing thing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; seems</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; like a very difficult problem to =
solve, the functionality </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; itself is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty minor, so I don't think that a =
UA should have to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; negotiate about</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the method to use for this... Also, I =
don't think your negotiation</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposal would work. You should =
remember that you have to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; reach the UAS</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; before you can do this negotiation in =
the first place, which means</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; may have to send a number of INVITEs, =
and receive 484 </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; responses from</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; proxies. And, even when you reach the =
UAS (let's assume </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it's a PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; gateway), it may be able to forward =
the digits, so the only answer</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; are going to get is 100 - which you =
will get from the first proxy,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; so</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; the UAS can't include the negotiation =
result there.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; This response-from-the-UAS thing is, =
however, related to another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; issue</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; which I will describe in another =
mail.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So, the UAC would include a =
'Supported' tag if it could </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; do overlap</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;INFOs and the mechanism would =
then only be used if both ends</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; supported</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it. Otherwise you would just kill =
session requests without enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;digits with 484s.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; See my comment above why I don't this =
would work very well.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Regarding Application Servers, =
the INFOs should certainly contain</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the digits so far (otherwise we =
get the problems with lost</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; messages).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I do not believe any proxies =
exist which are being used today in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;overlap situations and which need =
access to the whole called</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; number,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;so we can add this capability to =
the specification without</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; hurting any</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;existing implementations.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, well, well... Let's assume it's =
a proxy that sends the 484</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; response. Then, if you want to start =
using INFO, this proxy must</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; remember the INVITE, and collect the =
INFOs. Then, when </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the proxy has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; enough digits, what shall it do then? =
Create an INVITE of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; it's own? What</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; will then happen when the UAC receive =
the response for an </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INVITE it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; never created? Also, when the proxy =
sends the INVITE, it may</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; receive 484</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; responses from the NEXT proxy in the =
network, asking for more</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; digits.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ie, your proxy would have to both =
collect digits from the UAC, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; handle the next entity (in this =
example, another proxy) in the SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; nework. All this would DEFINITELY =
hurt existing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; implementations, so you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; would also have to negotiate with the =
proxies if they are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; able to do</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; this...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; In this case I think Keith's =
proposal, ie that the proxy is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; smart enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; to see that the only thing that has =
changed in the new </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; INVITE is the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; receiver digits, is MUCH easier to =
implement :)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, there are many reasons =
other than simple load balancing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; why</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one INVITE might be routed =
differently to a subsequent, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; apparently</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;identical, one. e.g. Time of day =
routing - which is certainly not</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;'random'. Stateful proxies may =
also remember where they sent the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;INVITE so that subsequent =
requests on the same call leg can be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; routed</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the same way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree, routing is a problem, but =
there has been proposals</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; to solve it,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; ie the one Keith gave. Also, I think =
that routing, and forking, is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; reason for a number of SIP related =
problems, so I think it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; better to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; find a generic solution to that. =
Allowing ROUTE headers </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; in specific</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; situations (again, see Keith's =
proposal) in initial requests</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; is partly a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; solution.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non-standard</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My reason for =
exploring the use of INFO is not to save on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages. It is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do with the issue =
of source routing. Again, my concern of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; source</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; routing is not one of =
a technical nature. What if an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; administration has a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; security policy that =
states source routing (a ROUTE </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; header in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an initial INVITE) =
will not take place in its SIP network</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it also requires</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same network =
interworks with the PSTN; if any part of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the PSTN =
interworking</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanism</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relies on source =
routing then there is a conflict of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirements. It is =
this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conflict</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wish to =
address.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, let's address this. =
Source routing is proposed in </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the draft</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; address load balancing. =
This is, a proxy that sends INVITEs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to different</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; egrees gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, if an IAM and one SAM =
are received, the second INVITE</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; might end</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in another gateway than the =
fist INVITE. This would trigger 2</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; IAMs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of 1 IAM and 1 =
SAM.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, this is the problem =
that has to be solved. What I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to say</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the draft (I did not have =
lot of time and it has to be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; rephrased),</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the following:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is strongly RECOMMENDED =
that proxies route </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; requests that are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basically identical and =
just differ in the to field (more</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digits) in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same way. So, if such as =
proxy performs load </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; balancing, all the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent INVITEs will =
reach the same egrees gateway.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not difficult to =
do, because most likely a call to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; +1234 has to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be routed in the same way =
as a call to +12345. So, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the only real</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirement in that proxies =
do not make routing </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; decisions based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; random variables (such as =
internal clocks).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, just in case folks =
did not feel comfortable with</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; this solution</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (which I believe is the =
good one), I outlined the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; source routing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what about load =
balancing? You can still have load</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; balancing.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proxy makes the routing =
decision based on to, from, and what</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever fields</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it wants. Then, it can =
calculate a digest of some fields,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; and make a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;random&quot; routing =
decision based on that hash. This </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; provides load</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; balancing but still routes =
INVITEs carrying SAMs in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; proper way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does this resolve your =
issue?</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (INFO vs. multiple</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call legs) =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have enough</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digits to select =
an egress gateway (which may be as few</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as one, i.e., +1</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selects a US =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gateway can be viewed =
as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =
sip:+1@provider.com, and all subsequent digits are PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues, outside the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scope of =
SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I definitively agree =
that this is the view that INFO fans</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have of a SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cloud. What I am =
saying is that this view is wrong. This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usage of SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; falls outside the =
scope of SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If they want to use =
SIP for locating a gateway,&nbsp; it is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fine. But after</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the gateway has been =
located, let's use another method for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transporting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ISUP =
signalling.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's assume that I =
get an IAM with &quot;+1&quot;, as Jonathan</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; says in his</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example. Then the =
INVITE generated by the gateway will reach</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; US</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gateway. Now, the =
mission of SIP has finished, since the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been located. Why =
don't we put in the body of this INVITE a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; description that =
comprises a media session and a SIGTRAN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session? This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way we would have =
established these two sessions between</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the gateways</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and all the subsequent =
ISUP messages would be sent over the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIGTRAN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find that the usage =
of SIP that I have just </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; described would</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I do not =
understand is why folks want to use SIP for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transporting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent ISUP =
messages. SIP does not have good transport</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properties</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (big overhead, it can =
run over UDP...). Besides, it does not</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ordered =
delivery.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the INVITE has =
Cseq=3D1 and the next message that the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; egrees gateway</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receives is a INFO =
with Cseq=3D7... what should the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; gateway do?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there were several =
proxies in the middle asking for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; credentials for the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO, so the ingrees =
gateway had to add authentication</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff and resend</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the INFO. If this was =
the case, the SAM contained in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO would be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the second digit of =
the called party number... </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; However, maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; 5</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages got lost, and =
the SAM that we have received in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INFO makes no sense =
without the previous ones because is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 7th digit</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the =
number...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not usually a =
problem in SIP, since all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; messages have full</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. However, using =
INFO for sending SAMs breaks this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; rule, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore it breaks =
the SIP model.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that =
considering that the session is established</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; after</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first INVITE and =
sending the following SAMs using INFO is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making one of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mistakes described =
in the guidelines for SIP authors:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We need to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transport ISUP =
signalling over IP between two gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Both gateways</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already implement =
SIP... why do we have to implement</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another protocol?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's use SIP to =
transport ISUP signalling&quot;. We are just</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to use</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SIP for this just =
because it would save implementing yet</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; another</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in the =
gateways.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I strongly disagree =
with this usage of SIP. SIP-T is good</FONT>

I'm new to this list and am interested in learning about any SIP applications or products that support encryption (privacy). Specifically, I would appreciate receiving private messages from anyone on this list providing me with information about SIP products or advances which support encryption. 

The reason for my query is that I am not aware of any existing SIP products which currently support encryption. However, many of our environments require that our collaboration sessions be encrypted due to firm privacy requirements. Thus, it seems probable to me that there must be some SIP products somewhere supporting this capability. 

I would appreciate pointers to any such products, as well as to technical descriptions concerning how the encryption is being done on these products (e.g., can these encrypted sessions also support QoS and multicast?).

Thank you for your attention to this query.

Thanks for the comments & questions.  Reply in the text below - in short I
mostly agree with Bert's comments.

Basically, the current ID on sip t.38 was a first text to stimulate
comments.   A couple of other errors have already been raised (Cseq,
Record-route headers).  From this discussion, I note the following:
  - sip-t38 text should be updated to better represent the possible choices
(a/ fax only comm; b/ voice then fax then voice again; c/ voice, then both
voice+fax back to voice only)
  - call flow should be updated also to follow the recommendations made in
t.38 annex D for sip (note that the current call flow represents the voice
then fax then voice again case which is a possible real-life case).

In the current ID, we terminate the audio stream and negotiate just a fax
stream (case b/ above).
Yes, we should probably not shut down the voice stream to mute it, i agree
;-)
--> if there is an agreement that the best practice is c/, we'll update the
Internet-draft.  Note however that the current call flow is not illegal...

*should*
yes, we should correct that by "adding" a fax stream.  Will propose new call
flow for review in the next couple of days.

This will be corrected.  Again it says *SHOULD* be added.
Note that there are cases where you would want to release the resources for
the audio streams when a fax is detected (for e.g. when your DSP pool is
running out of gas, should that ever happen...)

I prefer the second option (no general c= line, one c= line per media
description).  Shall we recommend this second option in the updated paper?

Agreed.  As a side note, how many of us send a fax and then return to an
audio call once fax transmission is complete?

I prefer the second option too.  c= lines in the media descriptions 
are required when a session has more than one media stream and 
they need to be controlled independently.

My voice and fax communications are curently separate calls.  But 
I don't have access to a SIP-enabled terminal capable of 
simultaneous voice and fax, yet :-)

Folks,

This question may have been answered before.

Question:
Does Transferee return NOTIFY-refersuccess if TransferTarget returns 
180 ringing (in response to INVITE from Transferee)?

Would appreciate help.

Hi,

I here try to make some kind of conclusion of the discussion.


ISSUES NO MATTER WHICH METHOD IS USED:
--------------------------------------


1. We should be allowed to insert Route headers in initial INVITEs

AND/OR

2. There should be some kind of routing mechnism in the proxis to make
sure that additional INVITEs are routed to the same gateway.

3. If a proxy routes additional INVITEs to another gateway, we may get
multiple IAMs.


At least the two first issues here are general issues for SIP, and not
only related to the overlap dialing. The third issue is related to PSTN
interworking in general, because because of forking and/or request
re-transmission INVITEs may end up at different gateways.


ISSUES WITH THE INFO METHOD:
----------------------------

4. We must wait for the response from the previous request before we
send an INFO.

5. Requires new extensions (header, option-tags,...?)


ISSUES WITH THE INVITE:
----------------------- 

6. Depending on the number of INVITEs that the gateway mangages to route
to the next PSTN entity, we will have a number of pending INVITE
transactions, since we only get a provisional response to those INVITEs
until one INVITE finaly has enough digits to generate a 200, plus 484
for all the pending requests.

7. One extra message, the ACK, for each INVITE. One ACK is nothing, but
if you have 20000 of them...




I didn't include the issue of "when a call is completely routed from a
SIP point of view", because we can spend months arguing about that - and
I anyway think we should make our solutions depending on what's best
from a TECHNICAL point of view, not from a definition point of view.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, that I am not against the
idea of using INFO. However, I PERSONALY don't think the advantages
compared to INVITEs are so big that we should spend time on that (we
MUST, however, clarify the provisional response thing, and which final
responses will be sent to the pending INVITEs, in the ISUP-SIP draft).
Instead, I think we should put our efforts on, among other things, the
general SIP issues (1-3) we have no matter which overlap dialing method
we have, and which we also have in other SIP scenarios.

Yes, the sip-implementors list has been switched to being run by the
'mailman' program, rather than 'majordomo'.

To subscribe to it, send mail to sip-implementors-request@cs.columbia.edu
with "subscribe" in the body, or visit
<http://lists.cs.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/sip-implementors> for a web
interface.

I've asked the lists.bell-labs.com sysadmins to update the list footer.

Of course, but then I think we should include all possible scenarios in
the call flows draft. Currently we only include one, and it's not even
the one according to the recommendation, ie the *SHOULD* :)

We should remember, though, that even if the fax initiator has enough
DSP resources, the other party may not. So, another question is if he
should be allowed to release the voice stream anyway, and somehow
indicate that
to the initiator, which then would know that it may not be possible to
switch back to voice after the fax transmission...

OR

...should be define some kind of "media stream could not be added" error
response code, and send back. After that, the initiator could send a new
re-INVITE, without the voice media description, and the receiver would
terminate the voice stream and replace it with the fax stream.

Things like this may of course be implementation issues, but I think
it's good to define the behaviour, and include them in the call flows -
to make sure we interop even when things don't work :)

I guess this also depends on what the SDP standard says. For example,
when we
establish the call for voice, we probably will have a general c= line.
Is it then allowed, in the re-INVITE, to remove that and then suddenly
insert the c= for the media description?

No, it's not illegal from a protocol point of view, but like you also

Hi,

More about the session-timer...


Assume user A establish a call with user B. A session-timer between A
and B is also establish.

Then, B wants to transfer A to user C, using REFER. A will then send
INVITE to C and establish a session. However, the session between A and
B is still open (even if there is no media) so the session-timer will
continue between them.

My first issue is that A (or B) may want to cancel the session-timer
during the session with C, and then maybe use it again if the media is
switched back to B at some stage. One solution would be for either A or
B
to increase the refresh timer during the A-to-C call, and then decrease
it
again if the A-to-B call continues, but is this possible?

The other issue is if B re-boots. Now, if A is sending the refreshes, B
will think it's a new call, so the phone will ring - AND, may start
sending media to B's RTP port specified in the SDP in the re-INVITE. So,
when A is talking to C, he may suddenly start hearing announcements,
ring tones, or even someone talking, from B. A's call control will not
know about this, since it will receive a 200 OK for the re-INVITE in
either case.


Comments?

As far as I know you shd be able to modify session refreshes timeout
anytime, by sending a new INVITE with a higher/lower Session-Expires timeout
value.....

The second problem of the UA mistaking a refresh for a new call is not
possible, the To: tag in the INVITE would give away.....

Hi,

More about the session-timer...


Assume user A establish a call with user B. A session-timer between A
and B is also establish.

Then, B wants to transfer A to user C, using REFER. A will then send
INVITE to C and establish a session. However, the session between A and
B is still open (even if there is no media) so the session-timer will
continue between them.

My first issue is that A (or B) may want to cancel the session-timer
during the session with C, and then maybe use it again if the media is
switched back to B at some stage. One solution would be for either A or
B
to increase the refresh timer during the A-to-C call, and then decrease
it
again if the A-to-B call continues, but is this possible?

The other issue is if B re-boots. Now, if A is sending the refreshes, B
will think it's a new call, so the phone will ring - AND, may start
sending media to B's RTP port specified in the SDP in the re-INVITE. So,
when A is talking to C, he may suddenly start hearing announcements,
ring tones, or even someone talking, from B. A's call control will not
know about this, since it will receive a 200 OK for the re-INVITE in
either case.

Yes, but the idea of using re-INVITEs for the refreshes is because it is
supposed to provide
a keep-alive mechnism, to re-establish the call if a SIP node on the
path has rebooted
(or otherwise lost the call). So, even if there is a tag the UAS would
probably still
try to re-establish the call, because since it rebooted it doesn't
remember it had a
call which it transfered to another user.

According to the Session refresh draft, if the one of the UA's were to
crash/reboot, if they were to receive such an INVITE (page 7 of the draft),
and they support Session Timer, they are supposed to respond back with a non
200 OK response and set the Session Expires time out to immediate expire
value to notify the far end that this call no longer exists..... that way
the sending UA knows such a reboot occurred and would tear the call down....

Ok, so then this only works for proxies, which I guess is ok, because a
user would probably notice if the remote party crashes because the media
disaperars.

I still think, however, that sending re-INVITEs, with all headers and
message bodies, is a littly clumsy. Instead there could be "lighter"
method (PING, or something), and if a 481 response is received THEN the
UAC could send a re-INVITE. After all, I don't think the proxies are
going to crash that often, compared to the number of bytes we are going
to send with INVITEs and ACKs... But, that's another issue :)

Hi all,

There is no clear  distinguish b/w the user and 
telephone subscriber of the SIP-URL.
since both user and global phone no in tele sub
are having many common characters like digits and '+'.

One more doubt is it necessary to make colon as 
escaped in telephone subscriber, as it is used as a
delimiter for password in the userinfo of the SIP-URL.

Thanks
lakshmi

Dear all,

The latest 3GPP CN1-SA2 SIP joint meeting dealt with a contribution about
co-operation between IETF and those 3GPP working groups which are working on
SIP protocol.

First a brief introduction of these 3GPP groups for those who are not
familiar with the organisation: SA2 is working group 2 in TSG (Technical
Specification Group) SA (Services and System Aspects). They are responsible
for the overall system architecture. CN1 is working group 1 in TSG CN (Core
Network) responsible for the Gm interface, i.e. the one between the terminal
and CSCF. CN1 is the WG which is most involved in 3GPP SIP work.

Tdoc N1-010233 titled "Feedback from IETF interim SIP working group meeting"
summarises the proposed 3GPP originated contributions and communication
between IETF and 3GPP meetings.

It became clear during the discussion on this document that the main reason
for lack of 3GPP originated contributions has been that the 3GPP delegates
have wanted to get the main 3GPP specifications more stable before
contributing them to IETF meetings.

However, it was also seen that sufficient stability is being reached and now
it is appropriate to start closer co-operation between the relevant working
groups of IETF and 3GPP. This needs to be done to provide IETF the
understanding of 3GPP decisions related with mobile SIP and to collect the
valuable comments and hints from the IETF SIP experts.

The following decisions on necessary 3GPP actions were made during the
discussion:

1. Chairman is asked to distribute a summary of CN1 SIP related discussions
and decisions to the IETF SIP mailing list.

2. The dependency between IETF RFCs and 3GPP TSs needs to identified. The
list of IETF SIP specifications which will be referred to will be
communicated to IETF SIP group by the rapporteur. This will be the list of
RFCs that are prerequisite for the publication of 3GPP specification as a
standard.

3. The work on the draft specifications is twofold: 3GPP needs to review and
comment on the IETF SIP drafts which are relevant for 3GPP, i.e. the ones
which are referred to by 3GPP specifications AND

4. Call flows defining the 3GPP related enhancements need to be contributed
to IETF by 3GPP members. This was addressed in the meeting by a drafting
group of 3GPP CN1 and SA2 members to draft an extract of 24.228 signalling
flows for IETF review and comments. 

An executive summary of the chairman's meeting report is attached. The full
report and the meeting documents are available in 

http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_CN/WG1_mm-cc-sm/SIP_meetings/CN1_SA2_03_(New%20J

Hannu Hietalahti

ROUTE headers in initial INVITEs are allowed according to the latest
text from J. Rosenberg (I think). Whether or not another domain's proxies
can be guarenteed to honour them is a different matter.

Why is a ROUTE header required in the very first initial INVITE anyway ?

The ROUTE header in 'real' subsequent INVITEs will guarentee that
these INVITEs do follow the same path. The conflict arises when the subsequent
INVITEs look like initial INVITEs with source routing; back to the above point.

If source routing cannot be guarenteed to interop between various domains
and INFO method is not to be used then two alternatives are left; either accept
that some extraneous IAMs are (infrequently ?) generated or mandate that the
UAC always sends the digits en-bloc (wait for stop digit or timer expiry). The
latter approach
avoids all problems posed by overlap sending and is the most likely to interop
in all scenarios (vanilla proxies, vanilla clients, application servers etc..).

I assume you are concerned with the delay in set up because of this. Well,
consider the situation when additional digits are carried in initial INVITEs; a
domain may require that AAA procedures are performed on all initial INVITEs
which will probably be a bigger drag on set up than waiting for the first
response
using the INFO approach.

The INVITEs generated by the ingress g/w all belong to the same call and
therefore
the same state machine within the ingress g/w (or a set of associated state
machines); the same applies
to the the egress g/w (assuming all the INVITEs get to the correct g/w). This is
very much like
multiple INVITEs (subsequent INVITEs allowed before 200 OK) on the same call
leg.
The only thing stopping that approach is current proxies will not handle the
subsequent INVITEs
before 200 OK but perhaps it is something to think about for the future.

I don't think that implementing INFO would be difficult. I also don't think that
this
approach would be incompatible with existing servers and clients as these would
use 484/404 if addressed with insufficient digits. However, it is clear that the
only
problem it is solving is the potential conflict with source routing. I am coming
to the
conclusion that mandating en-bloc working when sending  into the SIP network is
the
best, and simplest option; let the initial INVITE be the actual INVITE.

K. Robinson

Hi,

I here try to make some kind of conclusion of the discussion.


ISSUES NO MATTER WHICH METHOD IS USED:
--------------------------------------


1. We should be allowed to insert Route headers in initial INVITEs

AND/OR

2. There should be some kind of routing mechnism in the proxis to make
sure that additional INVITEs are routed to the same gateway.

3. If a proxy routes additional INVITEs to another gateway, we may get
multiple IAMs.


At least the two first issues here are general issues for SIP, and not
only related to the overlap dialing. The third issue is related to PSTN
interworking in general, because because of forking and/or request
re-transmission INVITEs may end up at different gateways.


ISSUES WITH THE INFO METHOD:
----------------------------

4. We must wait for the response from the previous request before we
send an INFO.

5. Requires new extensions (header, option-tags,...?)


ISSUES WITH THE INVITE:
-----------------------

6. Depending on the number of INVITEs that the gateway mangages to route
to the next PSTN entity, we will have a number of pending INVITE
transactions, since we only get a provisional response to those INVITEs
until one INVITE finaly has enough digits to generate a 200, plus 484
for all the pending requests.

7. One extra message, the ACK, for each INVITE. One ACK is nothing, but
if you have 20000 of them...




I didn't include the issue of "when a call is completely routed from a
SIP point of view", because we can spend months arguing about that - and
I anyway think we should make our solutions depending on what's best
from a TECHNICAL point of view, not from a definition point of view.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, that I am not against the
idea of using INFO. However, I PERSONALY don't think the advantages
compared to INVITEs are so big that we should spend time on that (we
MUST, however, clarify the provisional response thing, and which final
responses will be sent to the pending INVITEs, in the ISUP-SIP draft).
Instead, I think we should put our efforts on, among other things, the
general SIP issues (1-3) we have no matter which overlap dialing method
we have, and which we also have in other SIP scenarios.

Subject: [SIP] Minutes of 3GPP CN1-SA2 SIP joint meeting


Dear all,

The latest 3GPP CN1-SA2 SIP joint meeting dealt with a contribution about
co-operation between IETF and those 3GPP working groups which are working on
SIP protocol.

First a brief introduction of these 3GPP groups for those who are not
familiar with the organisation: SA2 is working group 2 in TSG (Technical
Specification Group) SA (Services and System Aspects). They are responsible
for the overall system architecture. CN1 is working group 1 in TSG CN (Core
Network) responsible for the Gm interface, i.e. the one between the terminal
and CSCF. CN1 is the WG which is most involved in 3GPP SIP work.

Tdoc N1-010233 titled "Feedback from IETF interim SIP working group meeting"
summarises the proposed 3GPP originated contributions and communication
between IETF and 3GPP meetings.

It became clear during the discussion on this document that the main reason
for lack of 3GPP originated contributions has been that the 3GPP delegates
have wanted to get the main 3GPP specifications more stable before
contributing them to IETF meetings.

However, it was also seen that sufficient stability is being reached and now
it is appropriate to start closer co-operation between the relevant working
groups of IETF and 3GPP. This needs to be done to provide IETF the
understanding of 3GPP decisions related with mobile SIP and to collect the
valuable comments and hints from the IETF SIP experts.

The following decisions on necessary 3GPP actions were made during the
discussion:

1. Chairman is asked to distribute a summary of CN1 SIP related discussions
and decisions to the IETF SIP mailing list.

2. The dependency between IETF RFCs and 3GPP TSs needs to identified. The
list of IETF SIP specifications which will be referred to will be
communicated to IETF SIP group by the rapporteur. This will be the list of
RFCs that are prerequisite for the publication of 3GPP specification as a
standard.

3. The work on the draft specifications is twofold: 3GPP needs to review and
comment on the IETF SIP drafts which are relevant for 3GPP, i.e. the ones
which are referred to by 3GPP specifications AND

4. Call flows defining the 3GPP related enhancements need to be contributed
to IETF by 3GPP members. This was addressed in the meeting by a drafting
group of 3GPP CN1 and SA2 members to draft an extract of 24.228 signalling
flows for IETF review and comments. 

An executive summary of the chairman's meeting report is attached. The full
report and the meeting documents are available in

Hannu,

I apologize for the pedantic postings, but I've looked at the N1-010233 tdoc
you reference.  Is that the "Executive summary" to which you refer?  I'm
just trying to clarify for folks that aren't familiar with the 3GPP document
numbering process (i.e. IETF likes more user friendly words (for drafts) and
we all know SIP does too).  I'm thinking that instead of attaching the
"Executive summary", you included it inline.  Is that correct?

Thanks,
Mary Barnes.

Hi, Everyone:

I agree with Keith that we should mandate en-block due to the following
benefits:

1. Simple solution considering the complexity, ambiguities and
incompatibilities in implementing the at
2. MGC that is handling the ISUP-SIP mapping can be intelligent enough to
perform en-blocking
3. First INVITE becomes the real INVITE and this solves all the potential
problems (e.g., routing, inefficiency of sending the signaling messages back
and forth, etc)
4. The additional delay incurring in collecting digits may not matter much
because we may have to deal with authentication, policies, and other related
functions to deal with the call

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy

ROUTE headers in initial INVITEs are allowed according to the latest
text from J. Rosenberg (I think). Whether or not another domain's proxies
can be guarenteed to honour them is a different matter.

Why is a ROUTE header required in the very first initial INVITE anyway ?

The ROUTE header in 'real' subsequent INVITEs will guarentee that
these INVITEs do follow the same path. The conflict arises when the
subsequent
INVITEs look like initial INVITEs with source routing; back to the above
point.

If source routing cannot be guarenteed to interop between various domains
and INFO method is not to be used then two alternatives are left; either
accept
that some extraneous IAMs are (infrequently ?) generated or mandate that the
UAC always sends the digits en-bloc (wait for stop digit or timer expiry).
The
latter approach
avoids all problems posed by overlap sending and is the most likely to
interop
in all scenarios (vanilla proxies, vanilla clients, application servers
etc..).

I assume you are concerned with the delay in set up because of this. Well,
consider the situation when additional digits are carried in initial
INVITEs; a
domain may require that AAA procedures are performed on all initial INVITEs
which will probably be a bigger drag on set up than waiting for the first
response
using the INFO approach.

The INVITEs generated by the ingress g/w all belong to the same call and
therefore
the same state machine within the ingress g/w (or a set of associated state
machines); the same applies
to the the egress g/w (assuming all the INVITEs get to the correct g/w).
This is
very much like
multiple INVITEs (subsequent INVITEs allowed before 200 OK) on the same call
leg.
The only thing stopping that approach is current proxies will not handle the
subsequent INVITEs
before 200 OK but perhaps it is something to think about for the future.

I don't think that implementing INFO would be difficult. I also don't think
that
this
approach would be incompatible with existing servers and clients as these
would
use 484/404 if addressed with insufficient digits. However, it is clear that
the
only
problem it is solving is the potential conflict with source routing. I am
coming
to the
conclusion that mandating en-bloc working when sending  into the SIP network
is
the
best, and simplest option; let the initial INVITE be the actual INVITE.

K. Robinson

Hi,

I here try to make some kind of conclusion of the discussion.


ISSUES NO MATTER WHICH METHOD IS USED:
--------------------------------------


1. We should be allowed to insert Route headers in initial INVITEs

AND/OR

2. There should be some kind of routing mechnism in the proxis to make
sure that additional INVITEs are routed to the same gateway.

3. If a proxy routes additional INVITEs to another gateway, we may get
multiple IAMs.


At least the two first issues here are general issues for SIP, and not
only related to the overlap dialing. The third issue is related to PSTN
interworking in general, because because of forking and/or request
re-transmission INVITEs may end up at different gateways.


ISSUES WITH THE INFO METHOD:
----------------------------

4. We must wait for the response from the previous request before we
send an INFO.

5. Requires new extensions (header, option-tags,...?)


ISSUES WITH THE INVITE:
-----------------------

6. Depending on the number of INVITEs that the gateway mangages to route
to the next PSTN entity, we will have a number of pending INVITE
transactions, since we only get a provisional response to those INVITEs
until one INVITE finaly has enough digits to generate a 200, plus 484
for all the pending requests.

7. One extra message, the ACK, for each INVITE. One ACK is nothing, but
if you have 20000 of them...




I didn't include the issue of "when a call is completely routed from a
SIP point of view", because we can spend months arguing about that - and
I anyway think we should make our solutions depending on what's best
from a TECHNICAL point of view, not from a definition point of view.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, that I am not against the
idea of using INFO. However, I PERSONALY don't think the advantages
compared to INVITEs are so big that we should spend time on that (we
MUST, however, clarify the provisional response thing, and which final
responses will be sent to the pending INVITEs, in the ISUP-SIP draft).
Instead, I think we should put our efforts on, among other things, the
general SIP issues (1-3) we have no matter which overlap dialing method
we have, and which we also have in other SIP scenarios.

Christer Holmberg

From my reading of RFC 2327 (SDP standard) I don't see a problem 
with this.  But it doesn't concern itself with a SIP reINVITE.  I don't 
remember seeing this detail discussed in the SIP RFC or bis either.  
I also don't believe it necessarily needs to be discussed in the bis.  
However, I can understand an implementation having a problem with this.  
But it's an implementation thing.  A robust implementation (one that 
realizes not all media streams may go to the same destination) should 
handle this IMO.

Hi friends,

Does anyone has the experience to help for this issue?
Can I use one IP process all incoming INVITE msg.
And use another IP to send all 1xx and 2xx msg with
the contact header associate.

Does the SIP required one transation should be finish
in same IP source.

Best regards.

Charles Zeng

!Re-send with re-format chart
Thanks

Dear Vijay,

Thanks for help.  We are considering the high-performance SIP server design.
Using one front processor (with its own IP) to receive all INVITE msg. Then
forwarding these msg to main processors for msg process.

For example:

Using CONTACT header, we can do:
==================
Multi-Processor UAS/UAC                  remote SIPTerminal
Processor 1       Processor 0
IP: 10.0.1.1       IP: 10.0.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVITE send to 10.0.0.1
<---------------------------------------------------

200 OK with contact=10.0.1.1 send from 10.0.0.1
---------------------------------------------------->

ACK send to 10.0.1.1
<----------------------------------------------------



But we want to do like this !!!
==================
Multi-Processor UAS/UAC                  remote SIPTerminal
Processor 1       Processor 0
IP: 10.0.1.1       IP: 10.0.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVITE send to 10.0.0.1
<---------------------------------------------------

Internal BUS send from Processor 0 to Processor 1
<-------INVITE

200 OK with contact=10.0.1.1 send from 10.0.1.1 (???)
---------------------------------------------------->

ACK send to 10.0.1.1
<----------------------------------------------------


Is it OK?

I am not sure. Because the INVITE/1xx/200OK is the one transcation define
in SIP protocol, when using UDP, it sugguest use connect() to bind the
destination IP to socket. The socket layer may reject the 100 Try, 183 and
200OK, treat them as the hacker packets.

Hi Ivan,

PFA a mail, in which you wrote "Right when the media engine detects the
format change, your pre-access codec will be notifed with the
Codec.setInputFormat() call with the new format," however, that is not the
case with my application.

I'm working in an application which detects Comfort Noise (CN) and handles
it. As per my understanding, non-voiced activity falls under CN thus a
"RemotePayloadChangeEvent" should signify switching formats between audio
format and CN.  However, I'm faced with the following two situations when
the "RemotePayloadChangeEvent" occurs and the format changes from audio
format.

Situation I. Pre-access codec is not called.
Situation II. Pre-access codec is called; the new format is CN.

The application receives/makes phone calls thro' Gateway. "Situation I"
typically happens in the pauses in phone rings and also when a user pauses
between voice activity.

In other words the number of occurrences of "RemotePayloadChangeEvent" is
*not equal* to the number of calls made to pre-access codec (the former
being more frequent).

Please help me understand what might happen in "Situation I"?

Warm regards,

--victor

Here some info for the record:

After exchanging a few emails with Anshul, I suggested removing
DirectAudioRenderer and use JavaSoundRenderer instead.  He
experimented with that and got better results.  Here's how to
switch off DirectAudioRenderer:

1) Run JMFRegistry;
2) Select the "PlugIns" tab;
3) Select the "Renderer" tab;
4) On the scrolling list, select
   com.sun.media.renderer.audio.DirectAudioRenderer;
5) Click "Remove"
6) Click "Commit"

JavaSound uses a large mixing buffer and is better at handling
data loss which is exactly the problem since the added codec
artificially injects breakup to the audio stream.  However,
the price for that is long latency.

We'll work on the DirectAudioRenderer to make it better
at handling data loss.  But there may still be a tradeoff
between latency and quality...

Subject: [SIP] Format changes but doesn't call pre-access codec's
setInputFormat() method!


Hi Ivan,

PFA a mail, in which you wrote "Right when the media engine detects the
format change, your pre-access codec will be notifed with the
Codec.setInputFormat() call with the new format," however, that is not the
case with my application.

I'm working in an application which detects Comfort Noise (CN) and handles
it. As per my understanding, non-voiced activity falls under CN thus a
"RemotePayloadChangeEvent" should signify switching formats between audio
format and CN.  However, I'm faced with the following two situations when
the "RemotePayloadChangeEvent" occurs and the format changes from audio
format.

Situation I. Pre-access codec is not called.
Situation II. Pre-access codec is called; the new format is CN.

The application receives/makes phone calls thro' Gateway. "Situation I"
typically happens in the pauses in phone rings and also when a user pauses
between voice activity.

In other words the number of occurrences of "RemotePayloadChangeEvent" is
*not equal* to the number of calls made to pre-access codec (the former
being more frequent).

Please help me understand what might happen in "Situation I"?

Warm regards,

--victor

Subject: Re: [JMF] New Audio Format / Comfort Noise / Custom Codec


Here some info for the record:

After exchanging a few emails with Anshul, I suggested removing
DirectAudioRenderer and use JavaSoundRenderer instead.  He
experimented with that and got better results.  Here's how to
switch off DirectAudioRenderer:

1) Run JMFRegistry;
2) Select the "PlugIns" tab;
3) Select the "Renderer" tab;
4) On the scrolling list, select
   com.sun.media.renderer.audio.DirectAudioRenderer;
5) Click "Remove"
6) Click "Commit"

JavaSound uses a large mixing buffer and is better at handling
data loss which is exactly the problem since the added codec
artificially injects breakup to the audio stream.  However,
the price for that is long latency.

We'll work on the DirectAudioRenderer to make it better
at handling data loss.  But there may still be a tradeoff
between latency and quality...

Draft-ietf-sip-privacy-00.txt states that for SIP to be a viable alternative to the current PSTN, SIP must support certain popular telephony services offering privacy. However, the draft does not address a SIP privacy need having a substantially more compelling business case (for many industries) than the services identified by this draft.

Specifically, if Internet-based collaboration, including VoIP, is to replace traditional telephony alternatives, including H.323-based conferencing, it is imperative that sessions initiated by SIP be optionally encrypted to ensure privacy protection. The requirement is that the parties participating in a session must be known to the other session participants, but that it be physically impossible for non-participants to eavesdrop upon that session, including thwarting all "man in the middle" exploits. The obvious approach by which this can be done is to define a "session encryption" alternative within SDP and a standard mechanism for encrypting traffic carried by RTP. It isn't clear to me whether SIP needs to be aware of the encrypted nature of this traffic or not, hence this query to this mail list: Does SIP need visibility into whether the session transports encrypt their data or not? 

A related question is: where should the encryption be done? Should it be done at the IPSec layer in a manner potentially transparent to the higher level protocols or should it be done at data level being conveyed by RTP -- or at some other layer? I would be very appreciative to learn what work, if any, members of this list have done to investigate these types of issues.

We have been trying to develop some upgrades to the security of
sip, without much success.  We have had interest at meetings, but no
proposals or list discussion.

Encryption of RTP is defined, and believed to be adequate.  There is
sentiment to allow integrity protection, which was done at in the
PacketCable specs.  Key distribution has to be done with the call control
(sip).  The mechanism currently used is to carry the keys in SDP, 
which implies that the SDP has to itself be encrypted.  The PGP mechanisms
in present SIP will allow you to do that, but we believe that such
mechanisms are insufficient.

For hop-by-hop security between sip components, IPSEC or TLS is quite
satisfactory.  The concern is end-to-end, or possibly domain to domain
through an untrusted set of domains.  You want the usual suspects,
authentication, integrity protection and confidentiality, with a dose of
replay protection.  Some even want non-repudiation, but usually that has to
do with billing, and thus may not be entirely a sip issue.  I'd like to see
a better way to get the keys for the RTP (D-H perhaps).

Should you have expertise, you are welcome to work on this problem.
There is a mailing list (sip-security@egroups.com), and we traditionally
hold a bof-like meeting during each IETF meeting, to which all are welcome.

It's not required in the FIRST initial INVITE.

This may happend even if INFO is used, since the first INVITE having
enough digits to
generate IAM may be forked and reach two different gateways. I think,
however, that this is more
an issue of how the operator confiugres his proxies, DNS, etc.

I guess this also depends very much on the requirements, and the
functionality provided, by your gateway.

For example, if all your INVITEs go to the same domain (ie the name host
name) you MAY send the first INVITE as soon as you get the first digit.
This will, however, generate LOTS of traffic, so I would assume that
most gateways have some kind of dialing plan/digit timer for the
outgoing SIP calls. This is also needed if INVITEs can be sent to
different domains depending on the user number. For example, 12345 may
be sent to sip:12345@proxy.spacecom.com, 12777 to
sip:12777@sip.whatevertel.com, and all 1800 numbers may be sent to some
redirect server that then returns a real phone number. In this case, the
UAC gateway will have to wait for a number of digits from PSTN before
the first INVITE can be sent.

This is true, but I think this is also much depending on how the network
is configured, if the UAC
gateway has some kind of dialplan etc etc etc. For example, you could
agrue, like for the routing case, that INVITEs that look similar (only
the To header and Request-URI has changed) will not require AAA
procedures...

Yes, but they are still separate transactions, which all have to be
finished and ACKed.

If you can implement this for all the scenarios in the world we would
never have to use overlap dialing. And, I  don't think that overlap
dialing will be used that much, but since it CAN be used we should make
sure it works.

I also think this is one case where experience will show how it works,
since there are no rules saying how an operator has to configure his
proxies, AAA etc.

Hi,

I'm extending SIP to provide geographical location of the mobile
host within Wireless LAN. Basically I'm trying to send geographical 
location with presence information like "Online/Offline/Away" through
NOTIFY method to subscriber of that particular presentity.

I want to update(NOTIFY) all the subscibers of the particular presentity
when that presentity moves within campus.

Is there any defined header in sip through which I can send geo-
graphical location in NOTIFY method?

Can someone send me some pointers if work is already been done?

Thanks,
Janak

Joining in a bit late here, but in any case:

Fundamentally, I don't understand why you view this as two separate media
streams. You are muting one when you want to use the other, so why have two in
the first place ? Also note, that there may be some undesirable QoS interactions
that way.

A couple of more specific comments on the current draft, some of which you may
have already gotten:
- T.30 CED is the same as as V.25 ANS and hence cannot be used as a fax
detection mechanism (the V.21 fax preamble is fine).
- Why must CNG tone detection not lead to a switch to T.38 ?
- SIP call flow should probably include a Contact header resulting in some of
your messages (e.g. ACK) going end-to-end rather than through the proxy).
- Section 4.1 mentions that different UDP ports are to be used where as Section
6.2 lists that as open issue. I agree with Section 6.2 and would leave that
choice to the gateways.

Joining in a bit late here, but in any case:

Fundamentally, I don't understand why you view this as two separate media
streams. You are muting one when you want to use the other, so why have two
in
the first place ? Also note, that there may be some undesirable QoS
interactions
that way.

A couple of more specific comments on the current draft, some of which you
may
have already gotten:
- T.30 CED is the same as as V.25 ANS and hence cannot be used as a fax
detection mechanism (the V.21 fax preamble is fine).
- Why must CNG tone detection not lead to a switch to T.38 ?
- SIP call flow should probably include a Contact header resulting in some
of
your messages (e.g. ACK) going end-to-end rather than through the proxy).
- Section 4.1 mentions that different UDP ports are to be used where as
Section
6.2 lists that as open issue. I agree with Section 6.2 and would leave that
choice to the gateways.

Hi, Gonzalo:

I appreciate that you have the first one to propose the en-blocking
solution.

Now, we have seen the pros and cons of all alternatives. It appears that the
en-blocking is the best solution.

Best regards,
Radhika

Hi,

If we remove the support of overlap dialing now, it won't take long
before we have a similar discussion again -   when people want to add it
back...

I agree, however, that in most cases one would use en-blocking, so
overlap dialing will probably be very much used. However, IF it is used,
we should agree on how it's done, and that it works.

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Dear all,
 
I am sorry for this inaccuracy of my posting yesterday. I am still learning
the netiquette of this mailing list.
 
I had my message typed assuming there would be an attachment, then realised
that huge attachments might not be liked very much and changed it to a link
to the main 3GPP website. But I forgot to remove the mention about
attachment, sorry!
 
If you follow the link to 3GPP meeting documents, you should find folders:
Agenda  - agenda items for the meeting, this should be available before the
meeting
Invitation - How & when to get there, provided by the host
Report - Minutes of the meeting separated here to tell it apart from the
other meeting documents
Tdocs - all tdocs proposed to the meeting
Templates - CR-cover page, tdoc request form, etc.
 
The executive summary I first intended to attach is Summary-NewJersey0102
and the full report containing the decisions and discussion on all documents
in the meeting is NewJersey0102.zip. 
 
When reading either report you get a pointer to the actual meeting
contributions which are all in Tdocs -folder.
 
Some 3GPP WGs publish their report as tdoc but I don't do that because such
a tdoc would be difficult to find among hundreds of other tdocs from a
meeting. It would also need to be revised several times as I distribute an
interim report with the status up to closing of business every day during
the meeting.
 
The naming convention for all 3GPP meetings is:
MN-yy####, where
M = 3GPP TSG or TSG working group meeting
N = number of working group or P for TSG plenary
yy = year (note that we used to have 3 digits for year during 2000 but then
we had to hex code tdoc 
       numbers towards the end of the year)
#### = running number of the tdoc in this meeting (plenary or WG) since
beginning of the year
 
So e.g. N1-010223 is the 0223th tdoc during year 01 in TSGN (Core Network)
working group 1.
 
BTW, if you wish to follow 3GPP CN1 SIP activities more regularly then why
not add a bookmark to

Hannu, 

I apologize for the pedantic postings, but I've looked at the N1-010233 tdoc
you reference.  Is that the "Executive summary" to which you refer?  I'm
just trying to clarify for folks that aren't familiar with the 3GPP document
numbering process (i.e. IETF likes more user friendly words (for drafts) and
we all know SIP does too).  I'm thinking that instead of attaching the
"Executive summary", you included it inline.  Is that correct?

Thanks, 
Mary Barnes.

Hannu, 

Where is the attachment containing the executive summary of this meeting?  
I checked the URL you included and was unable to determine from the
tdoclist, which document contained the executive summary.  Is this located
elsewhere?

Subject: [SIP] Minutes of 3GPP CN1-SA2 SIP joint meeting 


Dear all, 

The latest 3GPP CN1-SA2 SIP joint meeting dealt with a contribution about 
co-operation between IETF and those 3GPP working groups which are working on

SIP protocol. 

First a brief introduction of these 3GPP groups for those who are not 
familiar with the organisation: SA2 is working group 2 in TSG (Technical 
Specification Group) SA (Services and System Aspects). They are responsible 
for the overall system architecture. CN1 is working group 1 in TSG CN (Core 
Network) responsible for the Gm interface, i.e. the one between the terminal

and CSCF. CN1 is the WG which is most involved in 3GPP SIP work. 

Tdoc N1-010233 titled "Feedback from IETF interim SIP working group meeting"

summarises the proposed 3GPP originated contributions and communication 
between IETF and 3GPP meetings. 

It became clear during the discussion on this document that the main reason 
for lack of 3GPP originated contributions has been that the 3GPP delegates 
have wanted to get the main 3GPP specifications more stable before 
contributing them to IETF meetings. 

However, it was also seen that sufficient stability is being reached and now

it is appropriate to start closer co-operation between the relevant working 
groups of IETF and 3GPP. This needs to be done to provide IETF the 
understanding of 3GPP decisions related with mobile SIP and to collect the 
valuable comments and hints from the IETF SIP experts. 

The following decisions on necessary 3GPP actions were made during the 
discussion: 

1. Chairman is asked to distribute a summary of CN1 SIP related discussions 
and decisions to the IETF SIP mailing list. 

2. The dependency between IETF RFCs and 3GPP TSs needs to identified. The 
list of IETF SIP specifications which will be referred to will be 
communicated to IETF SIP group by the rapporteur. This will be the list of 
RFCs that are prerequisite for the publication of 3GPP specification as a 
standard. 

3. The work on the draft specifications is twofold: 3GPP needs to review and

comment on the IETF SIP drafts which are relevant for 3GPP, i.e. the ones 
which are referred to by 3GPP specifications AND 

4. Call flows defining the 3GPP related enhancements need to be contributed 
to IETF by 3GPP members. This was addressed in the meeting by a drafting 
group of 3GPP CN1 and SA2 members to draft an extract of 24.228 signalling 
flows for IETF review and comments. 

An executive summary of the chairman's meeting report is attached. The full 
report and the meeting documents are available in

Hello,

     Certainly, a SIP/PSTN g/w must be able to receive digits in overlap on the
PSTN side, but I can see no advantages of continuing with the overlap into the
SIP network.
In light of current discussion, perhaps it is worth proposing en-bloc working
into the SIP
network again and invite a technical discussion as to exactly why overlap should
be maintained
into the SIP network.

Regards,

K. Robinson.

That's what I proposed in the DC IETF (long time ago), and folks

I will be sending out a brief note on this topic early next week.
However, you're probably looking at extensions of the presence format,
rather than a SIP extension.

Hannu has circulated a summary of the last 3GPP discussion on the use of
SIP.

As there was a discussion in the IETF SIP WG ad-hoc on what drafts 3GPP was
currently looking at from the IETF, I undertook to provide the current list.

Before I give the list, I must stress that it is preliminary. The basis for
the list is the flows that currently exist in 24.228, and the elements of
signalling that they use. Therefore the list is probably incomplete because
24.228 is incomplete, and may be wrong, because 24.228 is still at a stage
where comments can significantly change its contents.

We are intending contributing significant parts of 24.228 to the SIP WG for
you to analyse, discuss, pull apart, comment on or whatever.

The list is currently as follows:

draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis		SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
draft-sip-manyfolks-resource	Integration of resource management and SIP
draft-ietf-sip-100rel		Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP
draft-ietf-sip-privacy		SIP extensions for caller identity and
privacy
draft-ietf-sip-call-auth		SIP extensions for media
authorization

The N1-010273 that was referred to in previous discussion on this list, is
the 3GPP work item description. This document evolves from meeting to
meeting (changing tdoc numbers as it goes!!!!), and will be used to maintain
the list of areas where we are dependent on IETF work. 3GPP intends to keep
you directly informed as that list changes.

Well, it is a long time since i do not follow SIP drafts, so maybe i am
talking about something already defined. Sorry if so.

There are at least two features involved, one is a specific header for
location information. It would be similar to GSM, which includes in every
call establishment information related to the cell the call is "sent" from.
It is a sort of location information, and currently most of the
call-related location services are based on this cell-info. I presume
probably 3GPP would require a SIP specific header for this purpose , also.

The second feature is how to handle the delivery of "location change" in a
not-call related basis. This problem (and also the presence information
delivery) will be faced by CAMEL Phase 3 (see 3GPP TS 23.078) by defining a
subscriber category (M-CSI) which is stored in the user profile in HLR and
also in the visited MSC-VLR. This category includes different triggers,
such as
* Location update in the same VLR service area
* Location update in another VLR service area
* IMSI attach, i.e. 1st REGISTER from the UA)
* MS initiated IMSI attach (explicit detach), i.e. un-REGISTER
* Network initiated IMSI detach (implicit detach), i.e. the UA does not
send another REGISTER in the specified time
So it is the MSC-VLR (visited SIP server, I think) the one that generates
such information from the one generated by the UA itself.
Seems that your extension in the NOTIFY behaviour is a sort of Location
update in the cellular environment. The difference is that in the cellular
environment this Location Update procedure is standardised, but i am not
sure your NOTIFY extension would be covered by all UAs. See also that CAMEL
Phase 1 is the one currently deployed in GSM networks, so it will take some
time to see CAMEL Phase 3 running

hope this helps

Hello,

I am going to put together a presentation for the next IETF. There we
will choose between a proposed solution for supporting overlap or doing
en-bloc (regular SIP) all the time.

This way we will be able to progress and move on.

See you guys in Minneapolis,

Gonzalo

To which I reply:
CAMEL is not alone; there is other work being developed in 3GPP that
isn't directly part of that particular "horse designed by a committee".

The LCS work is being done to design a system that provides location
info without being tied to the I.N./CAMEL system; the "location entities"
(GMLC, SMLC,...) are separate units. These may well need to be considered.

Also, as Keith commented, a "SIPish" architecture is being developed
in 3GPP; the MSC-VLR is not necessarily the same beast as a V-CSCF
(i.e. the first SIP proxy); it may well be the SMLC that generates the
data. How this fits with a SIP architecture is not yet clear.

I'm not sure that one can ASSUME that the UA knows where it is *in
a form that is of any use to anyone (i.e. not a Cell Global Id)*
As I understand it, for most of the LCS work, the current assumption
seems to be that the Network is most likely to calculate the position
of the Mobile User (i.e. the mobile user doesn't know where they are or
doesn't care to tell anyone the truth - a problem with E911).

I'm not sure how this fits into a SIP "end-to-end" architecture.
We seem to need not only a new header (with data in a form that's usable),
but also we need to decide who can put this data into the header. If it's
done by a proxy somewhere in the middle of the trail between end users,
this is ugly, IMHO.

All the best, Lawrence

Subject: [SIP] 3GPP current needs from SIP drafts


Hannu has circulated a summary of the last 3GPP discussion on the use of
SIP.

As there was a discussion in the IETF SIP WG ad-hoc on what drafts 3GPP was
currently looking at from the IETF, I undertook to provide the current list.

Before I give the list, I must stress that it is preliminary. The basis for
the list is the flows that currently exist in 24.228, and the elements of
signalling that they use. Therefore the list is probably incomplete because
24.228 is incomplete, and may be wrong, because 24.228 is still at a stage
where comments can significantly change its contents.

We are intending contributing significant parts of 24.228 to the SIP WG for
you to analyse, discuss, pull apart, comment on or whatever.

The list is currently as follows:

draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis		SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
draft-sip-manyfolks-resource	Integration of resource management and SIP
draft-ietf-sip-100rel		Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP
draft-ietf-sip-privacy		SIP extensions for caller identity and
privacy
draft-ietf-sip-call-auth		SIP extensions for media
authorization

The N1-010273 that was referred to in previous discussion on this list, is
the 3GPP work item description. This document evolves from meeting to
meeting (changing tdoc numbers as it goes!!!!), and will be used to maintain
the list of areas where we are dependent on IETF work. 3GPP intends to keep
you directly informed as that list changes.

Hi, Everyone:

Let me propose the following to deal with 3GPP in SIP WG:

1. Let the 3GPP folks propose their requirements what need to be done in SIP
based on the detail specs that they are developing (or they might have
already developed).
2. People in the SIP WG can then see whether any extensions are needed in
SIP to meet those requirements. (Most of the time, I have seen that no
extension is needed - it is just a matter of implementation.)
3. Let us examine how 3GPP's requirements differ with respect to some of the
I-Ds that are already there to deal with SIP mobility. 

In this way, we, in SIP WG, can have more focused discussion to meet 3GPP
requirements. I am still struggling to understand what are the actual
requirements that SIP does not currently have in the context of the 3GPP's
SIP-specific implementation architecture.

It will also help us to address all mobility related problems together
seeing the big picture: Cellular wireless-, LAN wireless-, and/or
wireline-mobility.

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy

Subject: Re: [SIP] geographical location





Well, it is a long time since i do not follow SIP drafts, so maybe i am
talking about something already defined. Sorry if so.

There are at least two features involved, one is a specific header for
location information. It would be similar to GSM, which includes in every
call establishment information related to the cell the call is "sent" from.
It is a sort of location information, and currently most of the
call-related location services are based on this cell-info. I presume
probably 3GPP would require a SIP specific header for this purpose , also.

The second feature is how to handle the delivery of "location change" in a
not-call related basis. This problem (and also the presence information
delivery) will be faced by CAMEL Phase 3 (see 3GPP TS 23.078) by defining a
subscriber category (M-CSI) which is stored in the user profile in HLR and
also in the visited MSC-VLR. This category includes different triggers,
such as
* Location update in the same VLR service area
* Location update in another VLR service area
* IMSI attach, i.e. 1st REGISTER from the UA)
* MS initiated IMSI attach (explicit detach), i.e. un-REGISTER
* Network initiated IMSI detach (implicit detach), i.e. the UA does not
send another REGISTER in the specified time
So it is the MSC-VLR (visited SIP server, I think) the one that generates
such information from the one generated by the UA itself.
Seems that your extension in the NOTIFY behaviour is a sort of Location
update in the cellular environment. The difference is that in the cellular
environment this Location Update procedure is standardised, but i am not
sure your NOTIFY extension would be covered by all UAs. See also that CAMEL
Phase 1 is the one currently deployed in GSM networks, so it will take some
time to see CAMEL Phase 3 running

hope this helps

Hi,

  If after sending an Invite a Record-Route header is received in
  a provisional  response and then a final response is received without a
  Record-Route header what are the ramifications of sending the ACK without
  a route header?  If the ACK is sent with same data as the Invite will the
  ACK not travel the same path as teh invite?

  What happens in the following scenario?

      A final response is received out of the blue  (no active transaction).  It
was
      possible that the record-route was received in a previous response.
However
      it this example the transaction timed-out and was deleted before the
final response
      was received. After getting the final response an ACK is built based on
the data
      in the final response and sent. If the final response did not contain a
record-route
      the ACK would not have a Route header.

Hello Flemming,

The I-D's text talks about putting the audio on hold while the fax
transmission is active.  Putting a media stream on hold in SIP is done by
specifying the connection address to be 0.0.0.0 (IP4).  So, to support the
scenario described two IP addresses must be present in the SDP.  The current
I-D replaces the audio with the t.38 fax as Christer pointed out, this is
contrary to the text.

I personally think it's fine to replace the audio with the t.38 fax if
that's what the two SIP endpoints want.  Christer already pointed out a
potential implementation problem if an endpoint wants to resume audio after
the fax completes, and it released resources since the audio session was
replaced.  It all depends on the service being provided and the desired
goals.

Regards,
Bert

Me too - I even think it's preferable.

Sorry - I missed that. Can you explain the issue again ?

I think that Lawrence is on target when mentioning LCS.

I think we need to distinguish two different functions in LCS:
- how the location information is conveyed to the LCS server (what you
discussed in your email)
- how a LCS client subscribes to this LCS server and how it receives
answers.

IMHO, this second function could be nicely implemented using the
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY methods. This way, location infomation could be combined
with presence information and allow some new interesting services...

To which I reply:
CAMEL is not alone; there is other work being developed in 3GPP that
isn't directly part of that particular "horse designed by a committee".

The LCS work is being done to design a system that provides location
info without being tied to the I.N./CAMEL system; the "location entities"
(GMLC, SMLC,...) are separate units. These may well need to be considered.

Also, as Keith commented, a "SIPish" architecture is being developed
in 3GPP; the MSC-VLR is not necessarily the same beast as a V-CSCF
(i.e. the first SIP proxy); it may well be the SMLC that generates the
data. How this fits with a SIP architecture is not yet clear.

I'm not sure that one can ASSUME that the UA knows where it is *in
a form that is of any use to anyone (i.e. not a Cell Global Id)*
As I understand it, for most of the LCS work, the current assumption
seems to be that the Network is most likely to calculate the position
of the Mobile User (i.e. the mobile user doesn't know where they are or
doesn't care to tell anyone the truth - a problem with E911).

I'm not sure how this fits into a SIP "end-to-end" architecture.
We seem to need not only a new header (with data in a form that's usable),
but also we need to decide who can put this data into the header. If it's
done by a proxy somewhere in the middle of the trail between end users,
this is ugly, IMHO.

OK, this is what Christer wrote earlier in this thread, the message is
http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2001q1/005726.html

"It was my understanding from the T.38 on IP recommendation that this is
the way it should work. We should add the fax stream, and mute the voice
stream instead of removing it, ie using a separate c= lines for each
media stream. I don't want to free resources I've used for the voice
when transmitting the fax, since I will probably need them if I switch
back from fax to voice."

Bert

The following may already be obvious but I'll
state it anyway.

Consider the case where QoS has been reserved for
the session, incurring a (usage based?) cost similar
to current PSTN long distance. Preserving this
reservation while faxing *MAY* not be an issue for some
consumers since the majority of faxes may be small
- seconds to a few minutes.

In other cases, such as in the legal world, faxes
may be quite large. One hundred page plus documents
faxed between offices is not uncommon in this
business. A significant cost savings could be realized
by releasing the bandwidth reservation during the
fax, then setting it up again when the fax is complete
(assuming voice will continue).

Some users may choose to hold the reservation during
fax transmission to increase transmission speed at a
monetary expense.

Lawrence,

We also need to keep in mind that there are two types of location:  logical 
and physical.  (At the end you seem to cross over from one type to the 
other.)  The former is location relative to the topology of the network; 
that is, I can route signaling and media to you, but you could be anywhere 
in the world.  The second is related to geographical location, ie Latitude, 
Longitude, Altitude, Degree of Error.  There may be little correlation of 
one to the other, so they may need to be handled independently.

Thanks for the comments.

Christer Holmberg pointed earlier that T.38 suggests to add the fax channel
to the voice stream and to mute the voice stream.
The only reference I found in T.38 Annex D (TD0262rev1), section 2.2.4
states:
"Note that during this switch over and the facsimile call, it may be useful
to mute the voice channel.  The voice channel may be used again once the end
of facsimile transmission is detected."
=> this implies that T.38 annex D recommends both streams in the same
session.

As I've pointed out earlier - and this is what was shown in the current
draft, I also prefer to replace the voice by a fax channel for the same DSP
resource consumption reasons.  BTW, this "replacement" does not prevent the
session to return to voice mode after the fax is over (re-INVITE with audio
sdp).

To keep everyone happy, I've updated the draft to accomodate both scenarios
and message details with proper SDP descriptions.

got it, thanks.
corrected - this was also noted in H.248/megaco Annex F

Flemming Andreasen wrote:

it could but my understanding is that CNG is optional so to limit the number
of cases we selected the Preamble sequence.  Also, because of the potential
glare effect, we decided to mandate for the Preamble detection...
Do you have any comments to improve the text there?

why is that useful in the sip t.38 case?
fyi, a record-route header line has been added to enforce the route through
proxy.

ok, I'll make a more affirmative statement.  We've run across both cases
here too and this has not been caused any interop issue so far.

As you know, this has been corrected in the upcoming I-D: we have 2
different flows and the text is consistent with the message details.

I guess there are reasons for this. One is that it is recommended that
you use TCP for fax, and since you use RTP/UDP for voice you will have
to use separate streams. I mean, you can modify the codecs you use for a
stream etc, but I don't think you can modify a single stream from UDP to
TCP...

>You are muting one when you want to use the other, so why have two in the first place ?

You want to continue the voice session after the fax has been sent, so
by keeping the voice stream during the fax transmissoion you don't have
to create a new voice stream after the fax, just "un-mute" the existing
one.

There are different way to detect a fax. The flows would be different
for all cases, and for interop issues you would have to implement all of
them. That is the reason why one mechanism was chosen.

I guess the reason you think so is because adding streams is not really
the easiest thing to do in MGCP, right? :) 

At the end, I guess this is up to the user to decide, and it also
depends on which transport protocols you use. For fax TCP is
recommended, while you use UDP (RTP) for voice. So, no matter if you
want to keep the voice stream or not, you still have to create a new
stream for the fax (you can't modify a stream from UDP to TCP...).

Also, if you want to continue the voice session after the fax
transmission it think the best thing to do is to keep the voice stream.
Otherwise you will have to, again, create a new stream after the fax,
instead of simply "un-mute" the existing one.
 
>>Christer already pointed out a
>>potential implementation problem if an endpoint wants to resume audio after

>Sorry - I missed that. Can you explain the issue again ?

Let's assume that the node receiving the fax tone wants to use separate
streams, so it sends a re-INVITE including SDP m= lines both for the
voice and fax (with the voice muted). Now, the node receiving the
re-INVITE may not have resources to establish an extra session. Instead
it may, if possible, want to modify to voice stream, OR to delete the
voice stream and replace it with a new fax stream. It must indicate this
to the other node, either by refusing to establish the fax session, or
to return a SDP indicating that there will not be two separate streams.

This case is not specific for fax, but whenever you have a session and
want to add streams.

Just to clarify: it's not T.38 that suggests this, it is the node (e.g.
gateway) that detects
the fax that may suggest this :)

There may some issues here, especially if you have a PSTN gateway. If
you do this, you basically want to create a new connection on the
endpoint. And, since you already have a connection there this won't
work. Ok, of course your gateway can be smart enough to handle this, but
- again - there probably would be some interop issues...

Hi,

Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the Bye-Also draft for
transfers. I could not find it in the IETF Draft Repository.

Says who ? A media stream is a media stream.

Well, first of all, how many fax calls actually turn into voice calls once they finish ?
Secondly, you already need signaling to "un-mute" the stream, so what's the advantage here ?
As mentioned previously, there are in fact several disadvantages, so if we were to do this,
it should be based on some real good pros, and I have yet to hear any.

True, however T.30 CED/V.25 ANS is not one of them.

OK. I would suggest clarifying the draft to make that clear then, as it currently reads like
it is forbidden to switch to T.38 on CNG.

Wrong - just create a new connection.

The problem I have with this is that it is in fact a single media stream. By
treating it as multiple media streams you have undesirable QoS interactions, you
complicate the implemenation (especially for a decompased gateway architectures)
since you would normally not try and do multimedia for what basically amounts to a
mono-media call (albeit admittedly with changing media parameters). If T.38 didn't
happen to use a different protocol/profile than RTP/AVP, you would never have
dreamed of this (in fact, I could define a T.38 payload type for RTP/AVP and you
wouldn't argue this way). Also, if it turns out that you will not use T.38 for
this call, but rather just passthrough, e.g. G.711, you are not going to add a new
media stream either, right ? That is why I think this is a rather questionable
approach.

This doesn't add up. You need signaling to "un-mute" your media stream. You need
signaling to change the parameters of a media stream. What is the difference here
?

media stream I assume

So if I understand correctly, you are essentially trying to negotiate what to do,
i.e. T.38 or continue as voice, by putting the voice stream on hold, add a T.38
media stream, and you then expect the other end to pick either one, somehow
"un-muting the muted stream" if the voice stream is continued. I think this is a
serious overloading of current semantics and procedures.

If you want to change the media parameters of an existing media stream, you simply
send a re-INVITE with the new proposed parameters for that media stream. The
receiver then either accepts or rejects that. That's the way SIP and SDP normally
works - why doesn't that work here ?

Yes, but please explain why you want to do that for fax ?

Since when could you not create more than one connection on an endpoint ?

Even for implementations that can only handle a single connection per endpoint,
since when could you not change the media parameters of that connection ?


Can we please get some real arguments on the table here - what is the problem ?

To which I agree:
Good point; however, the current assumptions seem to be that routing 
to (and from) a mobile SUAS is done by the Mobile Network 
Infrastructure (using "MobileIP-ish" means for the plumbing, and 
using a V-CSCN as the "local" SIP entity).

The drafts on SIP mobility that were presented last year (i.e. 
mobility at the application layer) are still *very* FFS; the 
"mainline view" seems to be that the physical routing side of things 
*should* be hidden within the mobile network plumbing.
In terms of the SIP level, the mobile SUAS/user will probably have a 
"phone number" and use something like enum - yes, that *is* mentioned 
in 23.228 :).

Amusingly, the same discussions that entertained us in Adelaide in 
the SPATIAL BoF are still with us on end user location;
there's physical location and civil location, and either may be 
required for the recipient of the info. Where one translates from 
what one has (somewhere along the trail) into something that the 
recipient end user needs is a big question. For example, with some 
measurement techniques, you get the "Base station Colour Code", which 
is as much use a chocolate soldier in a fire to most entities; how 
and where this is converted is "an interesting question".

Finally, whether or not all of this needs any extension to SIP, 
rather than just a usage profile, is another good question; I for one 
await some concrete proposals with interest.

The problem is when the detecting node wants to ADD the fax stream (and
keep the voice stream) but the other node is not able to add the fax
stream. Instead it wants to REPLACE the voice stream with the fax
stream. Of course it should not be a problem to do that, but the issue
was that the detecting node should be informed about this if it happens
- or, should the node be able to send a "stream could not be added"
response back to the detecting node, which may then send another
re-INVITE where it replaces the voice with fax, instead of adding the
fax to the voice. I don't see this as a problem, just as a scenario that
may take place, and my proposal was that we describe it in the call
flows.


Regards,

Christer

Christer,

Are there call flows available?  (I need them in SIP and MGCP.)

Thank you,
David

There are no reasons in the recommendation, and I guess that's why we

Well, the ones who made the recommendation maybe assumed that a UDP
stream can not be modified into a TCP stream just like that, and that
you will have to create a new TCP stream instead.

I do agree with you, though, that there is nothing from a protocol point
of view that would prevent this.

I don't know.

However, these questions will come up in future whenever we want to have
a multimedia session (audio + fax, audio + video, whatever), when
streams may be added and removed during the session. This may not be the
case for T.38, and the call flows are not supposed to solve general
multimedia issues, but if it is possible to solve also I see no reason
to "forbid" a voice session to continue after the fax transmission.

>Secondly, you already need signaling to "un-mute" the stream, so what's the advantage here ?

The only reason I can think about is what I wrote above about the UDP
and TCP streams. However, I would like the ones who made the
recommendation to use separate streams to define the reason why.

Christer

Hi David,

There are call flows for SIP. They are to be updated, though, and that
is what we are currently discussing.

Ok, I guess we agreed on that. There is some issues on how it will be
done, however, but let's discuss that elsewhere.

I guess that is an implementation issue, and depends on your gateway. If
it uses G.711, and detects fax, it may choose to use the existing voice
stream. 

However, since TCP is recommended for fax, it may choose it wants to add
a separate stream for the fax (or, modify the existing stream from UDP
to TCP) anyway.

That is also a reason why the voice stream must be muted during the fax
transmission. Otherwise you would get the fax stuff both on the G.711
voice stream and on the fax stream (and mix it together) and the
receiving fax machine would probably not be too happy...

>That is why I think this is a rather questionable approach.

The reason I wanted both (single- and multi stream) scenarios in the
call flows is the allow the use of whatever method wanted. If someone
wants to use a single stream he may do so, but if he for whatever reason
wants to use multi streams he should be allowed to do so too. Both nodes
may not support, or want to, use multi streams, and that is the reason
why I also want that scenario described in the call flows.
 
>>Also, if you want to continue the voice session after the fax

>>

At the end I guess the difference will be more on an implementation
level, since the protocol call flows will look pretty much the same in
both cases. Again, the only reason I personally can think of is the
issue related to UDP and TCP.

Correct.

What I said was what could happen if the detecting node wants to ADD a
stream, but the other node
isn't capable of doing that but it IS capable to replace/modify the
voice stream with the fax stream.

It DOES work here. I mentioned earlier that if the node refuses to add
the new stream (which is done using re-INVITE too) it normally shall
send some 4xx response. The issue I raised was if the node, instead of
doing this, should be allowed to instead replace the voice stream with
fax, and indicate that in the re-INVITE response. Personaly I do NOT
like the idea too much, though. First, it probably should be allowed
only for the specific fax case (which I mentioned earlier) and I think
most of us wants solution which are general from a SIP point of view.
Second, the detecting node should be informed if the fax stream can not
be added (after that, it MAY choose to send a new re-INVITE where the
voice is replaced with the fax).

>>This case is not specific for fax, but whenever you have a session and
>>want to add streams.
>Yes, but please explain why you want to do that for fax ?

The only reason is that we would be able to quickly establish the fax
connection even if the other node is not able to ADD the fax stream, but
it is able to REPLACE the voice with fax.

I do think, however, that there should be a 4xx response code, or at
least a Warning header code, to indicate that we were not able to add
the stream. There are Warning header codes to indicate that the codec
was not supported etc, but that is not the same.

Regards,

Christer

Maybe I missed some substantial point but I do not
understand why users and their applications should
be willing to deal with some technology-dependent 
geographical format. I really cannot expect
a Web/SIP server to understand coordinations expressed
in a format used by my local wireless company.

Geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation
and precision) will not change. Technological coordinates
(my GSM cell id) or civil names ("Europe Blvd" formerly
"Lenin Blvd" formerly "Stalin Blvd" formerly "Hitler
Blvd" in the city where I was born.) will.

I'd really prefer conveying *geo-coordinates* in web/sip
requests, regardless how they were obtained, what their
original encoding was and what the application dealing with 
them is.

I do not think that they should be bound to a specific
request method (like previously SUB-NOT or REGISTER were 
mentioned.) Something like 
INVITE reservations@hotel.com?latitutude=x;logitude=y;elevation=z 
would be useful as well.

There are three things, in fact.

Publication: whereby information about a presentity is sent to the presence
server for the presentity.

Subscription: whereby users in the network can request changes in
information about presence state of a presentity.

Notification: whereby subscribers are told by the presence server about
changes in presence state.


Particularly, note that publication and notification are different. In sip
for presence, REGISTER plays the role of a possible publication mechanism.
There are many others, and I think future communications systems will
involve presence coming from many disparate devices, through many different
protocols. As a result, a presence server will speak many languages in order
to collect the sum total presence information for a presentity.

Note also that it is inherent to the model, and even with SIP REGISTER, that
third parties can publish information for a presentity (specifically, the
From field of a REGISTER need not match the To field). 

So, I won't pretend to understand which device in the 3gpp architecture is
ideally suited to know the location of the mobile. But, once you figure it
out (and it could be more than one), those devices would publish presence
information to the presence server, possibly with REGISTER if its
convenient, or possibly with something else altogether. Then, this
information is included in the NOTIFYs generated by the presence server.
This requires fields added to the presence document format for location
information.

[moving over to the sip list, as we are now talking about changes to sip]

A few thoughts on directed pickup.

1. The mechanism in rfc2543 is a hack. It is meant to provide call pickup as
a side effect of register behavior. What would happen is that the register
would cause the original INVITE to fork to the second phone. The second
phone then answers, which causes the first call to be CANCELed. As such,
Alan's flow is wrong. The proxy would not CANCEL on receipt of REGISTER (why
would it do that?). Rather, it would generate the second INVITE, and when
its answered, then CANCEL. However, this mechanism has some big problems:

   a. its hard to do in a distributed system where the registrar and proxy
are separated
   b. it doesn't actually provide directed call pickup, since the user
experience is much different. IN this mode, the second phone will actually
ring!

2. The other proposals so far, involving REFER or a REGISTER directly to the
first phone, will not work. They both defined additional, service specific
semantics to these requests. Bad, bad.

3. It is possible to do directed pickup with a B2BUA. I worked through a
call flow for it, and it emulates completely the PSTN service. It requires
no extensions to SIP, just logic for the service in the picking-up phone and
in the B2BUA. Can it be done without a B2BUA in a distributed way? Maybe.
But, I'm not going to get hung up on emulating every infrequently used PSTN
service in a distributed way.

4. I believe we should actually remove the current text on directed pickup.
Thats because:

   a. we said that we don't standardize services, but here is random text in
the middle of a section which does just that. It was definitely an
afterthought.
   b. it doesn't work easily when the registrar and proxy are separated
   c. it doesn't actually do directed pickup as defined
   d. I don't think its that widely implemented.

Can anyone comment on d? Would anyone object to yanking this text?

We do call pickup with a B2BUA, which as stated doesn't require anything out
of the ordinary. With wide scale deployment of voice mail, this service
isn't really that useful. There are many better call completion features
today (voice mail, forking, etc.) which will eventually obsolete call
pickup. Last time I used it was about 10 years ago. I think it should be
yanked.

would cause the original INVITE to fork to the second phone. The second
phone then answers, which causes the first call to be CANCELed. As such,
Alan's flow is wrong. The proxy would not CANCEL on receipt of REGISTER (why
would it do that?). Rather, it would generate the second INVITE, and when
its answered, then CANCEL. However, this mechanism has some big problems:

   a. its hard to do in a distributed system where the registrar and proxy
are separated
   b. it doesn't actually provide directed call pickup, since the user
experience is much different. IN this mode, the second phone will actually
ring!

2. The other proposals so far, involving REFER or a REGISTER directly to the
first phone, will not work. They both defined additional, service specific
semantics to these requests. Bad, bad.

3. It is possible to do directed pickup with a B2BUA. I worked through a
call flow for it, and it emulates completely the PSTN service. It requires
no extensions to SIP, just logic for the service in the picking-up phone and
in the B2BUA. Can it be done without a B2BUA in a distributed way? Maybe.
But, I'm not going to get hung up on emulating every infrequently used PSTN
service in a distributed way.

4. I believe we should actually remove the current text on directed pickup.
Thats because:

   a. we said that we don't standardize services, but here is random text in
the middle of a section which does just that. It was definitely an
afterthought.
   b. it doesn't work easily when the registrar and proxy are separated
   c. it doesn't actually do directed pickup as defined
   d. I don't think its that widely implemented.

Can anyone comment on d? Would anyone object to yanking this text?

Hello everybody.
I have the following question.
When a SIP server receives a SIP message, it will insert itself into the VIA header en most likely also encrypt it.
Is there a consensus or "rule" to say that the border (proxy) SIP server of a network (the first SIP proxy of a network where external SIP messages enter the network before getting forwarded to other SIP servers inside the network)is not allowed to encrypt the VIA header?

My undestanding is that the VIA header encryption is desired to prevent others to read the internal SIP traffic pathway of a network. By encrypting all the VIA headers but the top most one by a bordering SIP proxy should be enough. (the top most header is the proxy itself in this case).

Why?

In this way, we can identify a network domain via the bordering proxies. Asuming that those proxies do not encrypt the VIA header after adding themself into the VIA header. This can be useful if a certain network is spanned over 6 seperate domains.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!

Arnoud van Wijk

Well, as it happens now with location based services in GSM every CellID
needs to be mapped on the geographical position of the antenna covering
that Cell, as I mentioned it is a 'kind of' location information, the only
one currently used so far by cellular operators. I agree with you that if
this information is to be delivered to third parties it must be translated
before, i.e. a server in the network should translate it into Latitude,
Longitude, Altitude, Degree of Error. Ive just read a few documents
covering LCS a couple of years ago, and if I understood it properly, one of
the location methods proposed needed a GPS-capable terminal, that, for
"real" time bahaviour, should be "assisted", i.e. need an interaction with
a server placed in the network which helps with positioning the satellites
and saves some time in the process. There was two more methods which
offered triangulation processes, but it seems you are used to work with LCS
and know the current status of that architecture. What I am not sure is if
LCS provides real-time information, which is needed in some scenarios. I
wanted to focus also the posibility to define triggers in the network
(CAMEL categories) to propagate location information to 3rd parties
whenever this location info. related to a particular subscriber changes. I
think this approach is more elegant than a continuous polling from the 3rd
party to the subscriber, and it is also more similar to the
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY model discussed here. Anyway CAMEL Phase 3 and LCS both
have pros and cons, and it will take some time to see both of them in real
networks.

What I wanted to point out is the UA will handle the Cell Global Id, and it
is already available  and it is included in the signalling messages (i.e.
IAM) that supports the ISUP based session stablishment. It is real-time,
call-related, currently available, and it is better than nothing :)

You are right, if a translation is needed, it doesn't fit in the SIP
"end-to-end" architecture. Neither assisted GPS nor network-based
triangulation methods fit in a "end-to-end" architecture.

>We seem to need not only a new header (with data in a form that's usable),

The location information handled by a terminal is provided by the network
in most of the cases, i.e. the terminal handles measurements related to the
radio subsystem, which are converted into location information. The only
scenario I know (im not an expert) with no interaction with the cellular
network is pure GPS, which do not provide real-time performance. Take into
account that GPS does not interact with the cellular network but with a
satellite network, which acts as a "server" providing some sort of
information to the GPS "client" . So, a "pure-end-to-end" solution for
location seems to me impossible, you need to trust on a server (lets call
it CAMEL CSE, LCS, GPS satellite, or whatever suits your needs better)

NO, we are not willing to use technology-dependent formats, but with the
already existing technologies, in some scenarios (like real-time) we are
forced to handle such "strange" formats and need network-based real-time

Yes, geographical coordinates is the goal I think ALL OF US are willing,
the point -at least for me- is IF the UA itself can by itself include
geographical coordinates on all different cellular scenarios. I know if the
UA includes GPS funtionality it will provide this info for you, the problem
is that it will take a couple of minutes for GPS to get this info. Does it
mean that the INVITE needs to be delayed for such a long period? If it
takes so much time for the UA with GPS capabilities to offer this kind of
info this means it will be only valid for non-real time services (i.e. I am
traking you on the web, you send me after two minutes your geographical
position obtained via GPRS)

IF (AND ONLY IF) there are not means for a UA to obtain geographical
coordinates on a real time basis BY ITSELF (i mean without interacting with
the cellular network) then it means if you want to provide such services
you WILL BE FORCED to do a translation in the visited cellular network in
terms of:
INVITE reservations@hotel.com?cellid=lewkjf
into
INVITE reservations@hotel.com?latitutude=x;logitude=y;elevation=z

actually IF a translation is required I would rather prefer to handle this
location info in a specific header.

I hope this clarifies why we started discussing about "strange" Cell-Id
codes. See I have always mentioned "...IF a translation is required...",
"...in certain scenarios..."

In a 3GPP network encryption of Via headers may be likely,
in RFC2453bis based one it isn't. Remember Via hiding was 
removed from the bis 02 spec due to concerns that it:
 
- interferes with loop detection
- operates on a trust model
- is widely ignored in implementations

Also network information is not just revealed in Vias but
can also appear in Record-Route, Route, SDP and any SIP 
URLs. (Path header too if this is used by 3GPP).

I think the motivation in 3GPP is more to do with providers 
hiding internal network topography rather than the fact 
signalling ever passed through them.

Why hiding the IP addresses or names of servers is of any value has
always baffled me. This strikes me as having no security value, but
making diagnosis of problems that much more difficult. After all, nobody
(except spammers) worries about "exposing the topology of email servers"
and does Received header hiding (I hope...). I think rather than rolling
over and saying "3GPP must know best", some effort at education should
be made by those active in that community. This strikes me as a
requirement where the best approach is to say "you really don't want to
do this" rather than devising ever more ingenious and complicated ways
to pursue the elusive goal of address hiding. If you truly want to hide
the IP address of the end system (for which arguments can be made, as
that address may reveal location information), you'll need some form of
B2B UA, with media handling.

This email thread is getting monotonous.

Please provide Flemming with a *reason* why you
desire two streams that makes sense.

Flemming has provided many reasons why you
would not desire to do this ... the most persuasive
being the fact that you would "double book" the
QoS requirements for the session (in the sense of
two QoS reservations - not necessarily double the
bandwidth reservation).

If you desire - at any given instant - to have either
stream "active" (i.e., non-muted) - and never desire
both to be active at a given time - then Flemming's
arguments should be sufficient.

The QoS argument is particularly persuasive
for access (last mile) systems where bandwidth
is precious (e.g., wireless, cable, DSL).

Even if this is not the case you are considering
(e.g., you are only concerned with VoIP over
large backbone networks) ... I'd still suggest,
for generality, that you do what Flemming
says. This is because you, IN GENERAL,
won't know the bandwidth limitations, if any,
of the other "IP end". And whoever "pays"
for the connection might have to pay and/or
account for two reservations instead of one.

Q.E.D.

The draft that defined Bye-Also is long expired.

New implementations should track the current work on transfer
in draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-nn.txt (-04 will be out today).

There was discussion at the interim meeting about capturing the
Bye-Also behavior in a historical draft.

Hi,

I am very happy to allow a single stream, and that's the reason why it
will be added to the call flows. I DO also agree, that if nobody can
give a good reason why we would need separate streams I think we should
consider it to be removed from the recommendation draft. This
discussion, however, was from the beginning about the bugs in call flows
draft, which is based on the recommendation. However, I think we all
agree that this discussion has showed that the recommendation should be
updated too...

Regards,

Christer

Scott,

I agree 100%.  It was a dumb feature to try and make digital
Centrex phones mimic the behavior of a keyset.  Nobody liked it,
nobody used it.

Yank it, please...

there is an uncertainty between some vendors if the two sip urls

sip:foo@bar.com
sip:foor@bar.com;user=phone

should be considered to match, when the urls appear in to or from
fields.

according to the text of section 2.1 they seem to match, since it says

o user or telephone-subscriber, password, host, port and any url-parameter
  parameters of the URI must match. If a component is omitted, it matches
  based on its default value. (For example, otherwise equivalent URLs
  without a port specification and with port 5060 match.) Components not
  found in both URLs being compared are ignored.

thus in the comparison, user=phone is ignored.  but this doesn't really
make sense, since according to table 2, the only mandatory component in
to and from fields is host.  thus also the two urls

sip:bar.com
sip:foor@bar.com;user=phone

would match.  so it looks to me like section 2.1 would require some
rewording.

I've removed the service description from the draft. However, this still
leaves the question what, if anything, the draft should say about the
desired behavior if the registration does change while sequential
forking, say, is going on. The current wording is:

  If the registration is changed while a user agent or proxy server
  processes an invitation, the new information {\SHOULD} be used.

I suspect the simplest behavior is to say that this is
implementation-dependent. In other words, if you want to allow adding a
new location to an on-going search in your proxy, fine, but you can't
rely on this to build a new service. 

(I'm trimming the cc list, since presumably everyone is on the SIP
mailing list and doesn't need to see two copies of each message.)

Right. Based on all your responses (thanks) it seems we are in much more agreement
than I thought we were. I also agree with your recommended next steps here.

No, if a componment is omitted it matches on it's default 
value. Table 2 defines the default value for user-param as 
'ip' not 'phone'.

These don't match either - the user part is still significant
in the comparison despite being omitted from one URL.

The attached draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-04 has been submitted
to the draft repostitory. This draft is destined to be split
into two (separating the definition of REFER from is use to
achieve transfer). I've kept them as one for this iteration
primarily to make sure the changes to the use of NOTIFY were
available in the draft repository before the March meeting.

Here's the changes section from the document:

   Editor's note: The changes for this revision focused on the changes
   to the NOTIFY response mechanism discussed at February's interim
   meeting, and clarification to the REFER method itself. As mentioned
   above, the intent is to separate this document into two. The split
   was postponed a version to ensure the edits to REFER/NOTIFY would be
   reflected in the ID repository in time for discussion at IETF 50.

   o  Modified contents of NOTIFYs to reflect the consensus at the
      interim meeting. One event type, with an application/sip body
      representing the information to be returned.
   o  Added message detail to the prototypical flow
   o  More explicitly stated that REFER MAY occur outside an existing
      call-leg
   o  Reinforced that REFER can be record-routed
   o  Made the presence of a Contact header mandatory
   o  Changed the positive response to a REFER request to 202 Accepted
      instead of 200 OK
   o  Corrected editing errors in examples and message diagrams

=0A=
=0A=
1. Overview=0A=
=0A=
   This document defines a SIP[1] extension, REFER, and details its =
use=0A=
   to provide Call Transfer capabilities. This is part of a family =
of=0A=
   Call Control extensions described in the Call Control =
Framework[2]=0A=
   document. =0A=
=0A=
   Editor's note: Per consensus at the February interim WG meeting, =
the=0A=
   two parts of this document, the definition of REFER and its use =
to=0A=
   achieve transfer, will be separated into separate documents. That=0A=
   separation will take place with the next revision of this document. =
=0A=
=0A=
   The mechanisms discussed here are most closely related to=0A=
   traditional unattended and consultation hold transfers. =
Discussion=0A=
   of attended transfer (where all parties are briefly in a =
conference)=0A=
   is deferred until the conferencing features in this framework are=0A=
   addressed. =0A=
=0A=
   This work has roots in draft-ietf-sip-cc-01[4] but some basic=0A=
   semantics are different. In particular, transfers are achieved=0A=
   through a new method that does not terminate the original =
signaling=0A=
   relationship. By disassociating transfers from the processing of=0A=
   BYE, these changes facilitate recovery of failed transfers and=0A=
   clarify state management in the participating entities. =0A=

3. The REFER Method=0A=
=0A=
   REFER is a SIP method as defined by RFC2543[1]. The REFER method=0A=
   indicates that the recipient (identified by the Request-URI) =
should=0A=
   contact a third party using the contact information provided in =
the=0A=
   method. A success response indicates that the recipient was able =
to=0A=
   contact the third party. =0A=
=0A=
   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol for emitting and responding =
to=0A=
   a REFER request are identical to those for a BYE request in [1]. =
The=0A=
   behavior of SIP entities not implementing the REFER (or any other=0A=
   unknown) method is explicitly defined in [1]. =0A=
=0A=
   A REFER request MAY be placed outside the scope of a call-leg=0A=
   created with an INVITE. REFER MAY be Record-Routed, hence MUST=0A=
   contain a single Contact header. REFERs occurring inside an =
existing=0A=
   call-leg MUST follow the Route/Record-Route logic of that =
call-leg.=0A=
   REFERs occurring outside an existing call-leg effectively create =
a=0A=
   new call-leg following the behavior of SUBSCRIBE specified [3]. =0A=
=0A=
3.1 The Refer-To Header=0A=
=0A=
   Refer-To is a request-header as defined by [1]. It may only =
appear=0A=
   in a REFER request. =0A=
=0A=
      Refer-To =3D ("Refer-To" | "r") ":" URL =0A=
=0A=
   A REFER method MUST contain exactly one Refer-To header. =0A=
=0A=
   The Refer-To header MAY be encrypted as part of end-end encryption. =
=0A=
=0A=
        The Contact header is an important part of the =

3.2 The Referred-By Header=0A=
=0A=
   Referred-By is a request-header as defined by [1]. It can appear =
in=0A=
   any request. It conveys the identity of the original REFERrer to =
the=0A=
   referred-to party, optionally proving the identity and that the=0A=
   REFERrer actually issued this reference. =0A=

        sig-scheme-parms =3D token "=3D" ( token | quoted-string )=0A=
=0A=
   The referrer-url contains the SIP URL of the party sending the =
REFER=0A=
   request. The referenced-url contains a copy of the URL placed in =
the=0A=
   Refer-To: header. Any occurrences of < or > in the referenced-url=0A=
   MUST be escaped. The ref-signature contains a signature over the=0A=
   concatenation of referrer-url and referenced-url.  An example=0A=
   signature scheme is given in section 3.1.2. =0A=
=0A=
   A REFER request MUST contain exactly one Referred-By header. =0A=
=0A=
   The Referred-By header SHOULD be signed to help detection of =
REFERs=0A=
   from unauthorized third parties. A signed Referred-By header =
SHOULD=0A=
   include a Date header in the referrer-url to facilitate detection =
of=0A=
   replay attacks. =0A=
=0A=
   A UA MAY reject a request containing an unsigned Referred-By =
header.=0A=
   A UA SHOULD verify the signature on any Referred-By header it=0A=

approval=0A=
   from the user to proceed (this request could be interactive or=0A=
   through configuration). Upon receiving approval from the user, =
the=0A=
   UA MUST contact the resource identified by the URL in the =
Refer-To:=0A=
   header. Note that if the URL is a SIP URL, it could contain =
header=0A=
   fields such as Call-Id that will be used to form the resulting=0A=
   request. If the URL is a SIP URL, the Referred-By header in the=0A=
   REFER request should be copied into the request sent to the=0A=
   referred-to resource. =0A=
=0A=
3.6.2 Reporting on the results of the reference=0A=
=0A=
3.6.2.1 Using NOTIFY=0A=
=0A=
   Once it is known whether the reference succeeded or failed, the =
UA=0A=
   receiving the REFER SHOULD notify the agent sending the refer =
using=0A=
   the NOTIFY mechanism defined in Event Notification in SIP[3] as =
if=0A=
   the the REFER had established a subscription. In particular: =0A=
=0A=
   o  Each NOTIFY should reflect the To:, From:, and Call-ID headers=0A=
      from the REFER as if they had arrived in a SUBSCRIBE. =0A=
=0A=
   o  Each NOTIFY MUST contain an event header of Event: refer =0A=
=0A=
   o  Each NOTIFY MUST contain a body of type "application/sip". The=0A=
      contents of this body are detailed in Section 3.6.2.2=0A=
=0A=
   o  Analogous to the case for SUBSCRIBE described in [3], the =
agent=0A=
      that issued the REFER MUST be prepared to receive a NOTIFY =

      the REFER transaction completes. =0A=

3.6.2.2 The body of the NOTIFY=0A=
=0A=
   Each NOTIFY MUST contain a body of type "application/sip". This =
body=0A=
   MUST begin with a SIP Response Status-Line as defined in [1]. The=0A=
   response class in this status line indicates the success of the=0A=
   referred action. The body MAY contain other SIP headers to =

   information about the outcome of the referenced action. =0A=

Internet-Draft        SIP Call Control - Transfer          February =
2001=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
   A minimal, but complete, implementation can respond with a single=0A=
   NOTIFY containing either the body: =0A=
=0A=
      SIP/2.0 200 OK =0A=
=0A=
   if the reference was successful or the body: =0A=
=0A=
      SIP/2.0 503 Service Unavailable =0A=
=0A=
   if the reference failed. =0A=
=0A=
   An implementation MAY include more of a SIP message in that body =
to=0A=
   convey more information. Warning headers received in responses to=0A=
   the referred action are good candidates. In fact, if the =
reference=0A=
   was to a SIP URL, entire response to the referenced action could =
be=0A=
   returned. However, doing so could have grave security =
repercussions=0A=
   (see Section 3.10). Implementers must carefully consider what =
they=0A=
   choose to include. =0A=
=0A=
   Note that if the reference was to a non-SIP URL, status in any=0A=
   NOTIFYs to the referrer must still be in the form of SIP Response=0A=
   Status-Lines. The minimal implementation discussed above is=0A=
   sufficient to provide a basic indication of success or failure. =
For=0A=
   example, if a client receives a REFER to a HTTP URL, and is=0A=
   successful in accessing the resource, its NOTIFY to the referrer =
can=0A=
   contain the application/sip body of "SIP/2.0 200 OK" =0A=

3.10 Security Considerations=0A=
=0A=
   The security requirements of [1] apply to the REFER method. =0A=
=0A=
   This mechanism relies on providing contact information for the=0A=
   referred-to resource to the party being referred. Care should be=0A=
   taken to provide a suitably restricted URI if the referred to=0A=
   resource should be protected. =0A=
=0A=
   Care should be taken when implementing the logic that determines=0A=
   whether or not to accept the REFER request. A UA not capable of=0A=
   accessing non-SIP URLs SHOULD NOT accept REFER requests to them. =0A=
=0A=
   Using application/sip bodies to return the progress and results of =
a=0A=
   REFER request is extremely powerful. Careless use of that =
capability=0A=
   will compromise security and privacy. Here are a couple of =
simple,=0A=
   somewhat contrived, examples to demonstrate the potential for harm. =
=0A=
=0A=
3.10.1 Circumventing privacy=0A=
=0A=
   Suppose Alice has a user-agent that accepts REFER requests to SIP=0A=
   INVITE URLs, and NOTIFYs the referrer of the progress of the =
INVITE=0A=
   by copying each response to the INVITE into the body of a NOTIFY. =

=0A=
   Suppose further that Carol has a reason to avoid Mallory and has=0A=
   configured her system at her proxy to only accept calls from a=0A=
   certain set of people she trusts (including Alice), so that =
Mallory=0A=
   doesn't learn when she's around, or what user agent she's =
actually=0A=
   using. =0A=
=0A=
   Mallory can send a REFER to Alice, with a Refer-To: indicating=0A=
   Carol. If Alice can reach Carol, the 200 OK Carol sends gets=0A=
   returned to Mallory in a NOTIFY, letting him know not only that=0A=
   Carol is around, but also the IP address of the agent she's using. =
=0A=
=0A=
3.10.2 Circumventing security=0A=
=0A=
   Suppose Alice, with the same user agent as above, is working at a=0A=
   company that is working on the greatest SIP device ever invented =
-=0A=
   the SIP FOO. The company has been working for months building the=0A=
   device and the marketing materials, carefully keeping the idea, =
even=0A=
   the name of the idea secret (since a FOO is one of those things =
that=0A=
   anybody could do if they'd just had the idea first). FOO is up =
and=0A=
   running, and anyone at the company can use it, but it's not=0A=
   available outside the company firewall. =0A=
=0A=
   Mallory has heard rumor that Alice's company is onto something =
big,=0A=
   and has even managed to get his hands on a URL that he suspects=0A=
   might have something to do with it. He sends a REFER to ALICE =
with=0A=
   the mysterious URL and as Alice connects to the FOO, Mallory gets=0A=
   NOTIFYs with bodies containing =0A=
=0A=
      Server: FOO/v0.9.7=0A=
=0A=
3.10.3 Limiting the breach=0A=
=0A=
   For each of these cases, and in general, returning a carefully=0A=
   selected subset of the information available about the progress =
of=0A=
   the reference through the NOTIFYs mitigates risk. The minimal=0A=
   implementation described in Section 3.6.2.2 exposes the least=0A=
   information about what the agent operating on the REFER request =
has=0A=
   done, and is least likely to be a useful tool for malicious users. =

4. Call Transfer=0A=
=0A=
4.1 Actors and Roles=0A=
=0A=
   There are three actors in a given transfer event, each playing =
one=0A=
   of the following roles: =0A=
=0A=
        Transferee -      the party being transferred to the =
Transfer=0A=
                          Target.=0A=
=0A=
        Transferor -      the party initiating the transfer=0A=
=0A=
        Transfer Target - the new party being introduced into a call =
with=0A=
                          the Transferee.=0A=
=0A=
   The following roles are used to describe transfer requirements =
and=0A=
   scenarios: =0A=
=0A=
        Originator -  wishes to place a call to the Recipient. This =
actor=0A=
                      is the source of the first INVITE in a session, =
to=0A=
                      either a Facilitator or a Screener.=0A=
=0A=
        Facilitator - receives a call or out-of-band request from =
the=0A=
                      Originator, establishes a call to the =
Recipient=0A=
                      through the Screener, and connects the Originator =
to=0A=
                      the Recipient.=0A=
=0A=
        Screener -    receives a call ultimately intended for the =
Recipient=0A=
                      and transfers the calling party to the Recipient =
if=0A=
                      appropriate.=0A=
=0A=
        Recipient -   the party the Originator is ultimately connected =
to.=0A=
=0A=
4.2 Requirements=0A=
   1.  Any party in a SIP session MUST be able to transfer any other=0A=
       party in that session at any point in that session.=0A=
   2.  The Transferor and the Transferee MUST NOT be removed from a=0A=
       session as part of a transfer transaction.=0A=
=0A=
             At first glance, requirement 2 may seem to indicate=0A=
             that the user experience in a transfer must be=0A=
             significantly different from what a current PBX or=0A=
             Centrex user expects. As the call-flows in this=0A=
             document show, this is not the case. A client MAY=0A=
             preserve the current experience. In fact, without=0A=
             this requirement, some forms of the current=0A=
             experience (ringback on unattended transfer failure=0A=
             for instance) will be lost.=0A=

Internet-Draft        SIP Call Control - Transfer          February =
2001=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
   3.  The Transferor MUST know whether or not the transfer was=0A=
       successful (this is significantly different from the=0A=
       requirements of draft-ietf-sip-cc-01).=0A=
=0A=
4.3 Using REFER to achieve Call Transfer=0A=
=0A=
   A REFER can be issued by the Transferor to cause the Transferee =
to=0A=
   issue an INVITE to the Transfer-Target. Note that a successful =
REFER=0A=
   transaction does not terminate the session between the Transferor=0A=
   and the Transferee. If those parties wish to terminate their=0A=
   session, they must do so with a subsequent BYE request. The media=0A=
   negotiated between the transferee and the transfer target is not=0A=
   affected by the media that had been negotiated between the=0A=
   transferor and the transferee. In particular, the INVITE issued =
by=0A=
   the Transferee will have the same SDP body it would have if he=0A=
   Transferee had initiated that INVITE on its own. Further, the=0A=
   disposition of the media streams between the Transferor and the=0A=
   Transferee is not altered by the REFER method. Agents may alter a=0A=
   session's media through additional signaling. For example, they =
may=0A=
   make use of the SIP hold re-INVITE [1] or the conferencing=0A=
   extensions provided by this framework. =0A=
=0A=
4.4 Unattended Transfer=0A=
=0A=
   Unattended Transfer consists of the Transferor providing the=0A=
   Transfer Target's contact to the Transferee. The Transferee =
attempts=0A=
   to establish a session using that contact and reports the results =
of=0A=
   that attempt to the Transferor. The signaling relationship =
between=0A=
   the Transferor and Transferee is not terminated, so the call is=0A=
   recoverable if the Transfer Target cannot be reached. Note that =
the=0A=
   Transfer Target's contact information has been exposed to the=0A=
   Transferee. The provided contact can be used to make new calls in=0A=
   the future. The diagrams below show indicate the first line of =
each=0A=
   message. All messages in a particular diagram share the same=0A=
   Call-ID. In these diagrams, media is managed through reINVITE =
holds,=0A=
   but other mechanisms (mixing multiple media streams at the UA or=0A=
   using the conferencing extensions for example) are valid. =0A=

4.5.3 Consultation Hold in the presence of forking proxies=0A=

   It is worth noting that the examples given above abstract away =
any=0A=
   proxies that might be between the three parties. In 4.5.1 for=0A=
   example, the URL used to reach the Transfer Target may go through =
a=0A=
   forking proxy. There is no guarantee that the Transferee's and=0A=
   Transferor's invitations to the Transfer Target will reach the =
same=0A=
   endpoint. If the proxy forked in parallel, both invitations could=0A=
   cause multiple endpoints to ring. To increase the probability of =
the=0A=

only=0A=
   the same endpoint as the consultation invite, the Transferor =

I believe the confusion is over the last line of the paragraph: 

"Components not found in both URLs being compared are ignored."

What this is supposed to mean (I think) is that parameters without default 
values such as maddr-param or *future-parameters* should be ignored if they 
only exist in one sip url:

e.g. the following are equivalent:

sip:gethin@ubiquity.net;transport=UDP
sip:gethin@ubiquity.net
sip:gethin@ubiquity.net;maddr=sip.mcast.net;foo=bar

but not these:

sip:gethin@ubiquity.net;transport=TCP
sip:gethin@ubiquity.net

I do however think that this should be re-fined for parameters that are not 
known about. for example it is impossible for a server to make a 
correct decision on the equality of two unknown parameters

e.g. is

sip:gethin@ubiquity.net;foo=BAR

equivalent to

sip:gethin@ubiquity.net;foo=bar

IMHO I believe that unknown parameters should be ignored when doing a 
comparison.

This confusion isn't helped by the incomplete examples given in the latest 
bis, though i believe these have been correct ed for the next release.

I hope I can clarify this a bit. First, the goal
is not to hide the address of the endpoint. The
goal is to hide the capacity of the core or internal
network. That is, the number of SIP servers in a
given domain. This information is seen as a competitive
advantage in the wireless arena.

In 3GPP, there are essentially three SIP "servers":
A Proxy CSCF (Call Session Control Function) which
sits on the border between the access network and the
core network, the Interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF) that
sits on the border between two operator's network,
and a serving CSCF (S-CSCF) that is the real SIP server
for a subscriber. The goal is to hide the number of
S-CSCFs in an operator's network. To do this, the
I-CSCF is being tasked with this Via: hiding function.

Hope this helps somewhat,
sean

Again, this seems a peculiar notion of sensitive information. Since
adding a server costs 1U and $3k, it doesn't seem like that this is a
good indicator of the number of customers or anything else. Why would
this matter any more than me finding out that AOL has 4 servers for
inbound email:

host -t mx aol.com
aol.com                 MX      15 mailin-01.mx.aol.com
aol.com                 MX      15 mailin-02.mx.aol.com
aol.com                 MX      15 mailin-03.mx.aol.com
aol.com                 MX      15 mailin-04.mx.aol.com

Or that I can analyze a bunch of email messages from AOL and find out
which servers generate my inbound email?

Via: "hiding" as it is being defined for 3GPP is much different
than the Via: hiding that was in the bis draft. In 3GPP,
we are not asking the next hop to hide our Via: headers
for us. Instead a node is being given the job to hide
the Via: headers of outgoing requests and "un-hide" (
I'm trying to avoid the term decrypt :) the Via: headers
for inbound responses. None of the problems that exist
for the 2543 mechanism of Via: hiding apply in this case.

It's been suggested that the referenced-url parameter to the
Referred-By: header should be optional if the header does not
contain a signature. 

Currently, the syntax is

Referred-By      = ("Referred-By" | "b") ":" referrer-url ";"
                      (     referenced-url
                        | ( referenced-url ";" ref-signature )
                        | ( ref-signature ";" referenced-url )
                      )

The minimal form is

Referred-By = "b" ":" referrer-url ";" referenced-url

The referenced-url was originally included in the header to make
verifying the signature possible (it MUST be there if a signature
is present), but without a signature it has only informational
value.

So, would the following be acceptable?

Referred-By      = ("Referred-By" | "b") ":" referrer-url ";"
                      [(     referenced-url
                        | ( referenced-url ";" ref-signature )
                        | ( ref-signature ";" referenced-url )
                       )]

Hello everybody.

A SIP proxy can be addressed with a SIP URL, and via the URL the IP address can be found.
If I am a crazy network provider who wants to give the same SIP Proxy server different SIP URLS, i.e. 
pegasus@amcrazy.net
solstice@amcrazy.net
666@devil.com
etc.

This should be possible as long that the domains and names are owned by me.
In this case if solstice@amcrazy.net is looked up..the IP address will be located, which is the same one if 666@devil.com is looked up.

So, as long that the SIP Proxy server registers all the SIP URLs at the registrars. This should be possible to pull off.

Is that right? Or am I forgetting something? Has this already been looked at and perhaps decreed as an illegal act? (like registrar only allowing the newest registration with the same IP address)

Thanks for your time

Greetings

Arnoud van Wijk

Hold on:
This thread is going in every directions.

First and starting now, please mention references when you state things
like:
> I guess there are reasons for this. One is that it is recommended that
> you use TCP for fax
First, t.38 recommendation is clear:  either TCP or UDP. So I disagree on
that statement.
Second, we had polled the implementors when doing imtc inow profiles and the
response was clear for gw vendors: UDP.
Third, ultimately, vendors should support both and the internet-draft does
not prevent TCP at all.
So let's leave this out of the discussion.
Jean-Francois.

I would have thought some of them could still apply:
 - prevention of fault diagnosis
 - complexity overhead
 - interference with loop detection 
Isn't there is also still a trust issue of sorts if you 
expect another node to hide your entry in the Via headers
for you. I guess it is too early to say on implementations 
ignoring it ;)

Cheers,
Neil.

Minor remark: I find the syntax description for this header very hard to
parse. Having ";" outside the parameter description is odd. Also, we
never specify all permutations of orderings, as they are all equivalent
(i.e., ordering within a list of semicolon parameters never matters).
How about some variation on

Referred-By      = ("Referred-By" | "b") ":" referrer-url [
referenced-URL ]

        referrer-url     = ( name-addr | addr-spec )
        referenced-url   = ";" ref" "=" "<" URL ">" [ ref-signature ]
        ref-signature    = ";" signature-scheme *( sig-scheme-params )
        signature-scheme = ";" "scheme" "=" token
        sig-scheme-parms = ";" token "=" ( token | quoted-string )

(actually, the sig-scheme-parameter is just a generic parameter, so no
need to define it again here.)

This doesn't prevent the diagnosis of faults.
It isolates the fault diagnosis to the operator
in which the fault occurs.

There is more complexity involved. Add any
feature and you add complexity. The question
is whether the complexity is worth it.

Loop detection still works fine. Your Via:
will always appear in the clear to you. Complex
looping scenarios between operators may still
cause problems. This is less likely with the
3GPP architecture, but is something to consider.

There is a trust relationship. This relationship
is well defined in the 3GPP architecture and is
in fact completely internal to a single operator's
network.

The big difference between the 3GPP mechanism and the
mechanism that exists in 2543 is that there is nothing
in the SIP message that is being used to signal to
another SIP server that you wish for it to hide your
Via:'s. There exists a priori a trust relationship
between the two nodes. The hiding of Via:'s is in fact
completely transparent to both inbound traffic and outbound
traffic.

Basically, there is a special purpose proxy that is providing
this functionality. That functionality is guaranteed to be there
by virtue of the architecture -- there is no concern that the
next hop can't provide the necessary hiding functionality.

From what I have seen of the 3GPP docs it appears there 
could be the potential for a lot of state information being 
stored in these servers. P-CSCFs might be expected to 
maintain mappings of hidden/unhidden Vias, user registrations, 
session signalling paths and even individual call path info 
(when they strip out all Via headers before passing INVITEs 
to called parties)? This type of behaviour means you lose the 
scalability and reliability features for network servers 
that were intended with SIP. Is there not the case for at least
a more DCS-like approach where you at least store state info 
that you really need in the UEs. The revised Record-Route text 
means you wouldn't even need a State header extension. I 
appreciate that there could be issues with storing information 
in the UAs/UEs and retransmitting it over an air interface, 
but if bandwidth is the over riding concern for you SIP is not 
the best protocol to choose in the first place.

Cheers,
Neil

So what is the competitive advantage derived from knowing
how many/few servers in the network? 

I was guessing that the desire to hide network servers
from end points was out of concerns for concealing them
from people like me who might play around with Path or 
pre-loaded Route headers ;)

Cheers,
Neil.

sounds like an implementation choice to me.

this is trivial to fix: the second phone/gw just creates some local state, 
so that when an INVITE for that request-uri arrives, it simply replies with 
a 200.  Note that on an analog phone, you are already "offhook" anyway.

agreed.

All you've done is moved the problem around.  Now all calls that can be 
picked up have to go through this B2BUA.  Eventually this will need the 
performance of some kind of proxy (but it needs to keep more state and 
handle twice as many transactions), so if you want to provide redundancy or 
load sharing you need to add some additional state-sharing scheme, 
etc.  Congratulations, you've just recreated the MGCP model over SIP!  ;-)

IMO, B2BUA is an overused crutch.  I don't object to folks implementing 
their own services with it, but I don't want us to cripple the spec, or 
actively encourage others to recreate that which we try to avoid.

I object to yanking the text about acting on a REGISTER in progress.  If 
you want to yank the reference to "this is how you do call pickup" that's 
fine with me.

We have already discussed how to do this in our proxy in a distributed way, 
and we don't have to ring the phone.

There is room for implementations using both models.

Hi,

This is NOT a we-must-use-multiple-streams argument, but do you think
the following case could have something to do with the recommendation?

Let's assume that gateway B detects the fax tone. It now modifies the
stream, which may lead to a new port, different from the voice stream,
for the fax stream. Now, it will take a while (even if a very short one)
for B to inform A about the change, so A may continue to send voice to
B's voice port. If B changed port when the fax was detected, that port
will not be available anymore, so A will probably start receiving ICMP
messages - which COULD (depending on the time it takes for B to inform A
about the modification) cause A to release the call, or something
similar unwanted... Instead, if you mute the channel the voice packets
will still be received on B's voice port, even if they will not be
forwarded.

Comments?

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

>Right. Based on all your responses (thanks) it seems we are in much more agreement
>than I thought we were. I also agree with your recommended next steps here.

The "funny" thing is that the recommendation is an ITU document (ITU-T
Recommendation T.38 Amendment 2)... 

The recommendation is also based on H.323, which could be the reason for
using separate streams.
They also use multiple m= lines to define options, which I don't think
is the correct usage or SDP(?)

Regards,

Christer

All what you say does make sense, Still allow me to be picky a bit and to enhance some more about the CSCF flavors, in favor of those who may learn from it. (Though I know you know it for sure and was just short in time..)

The Proxy CSCF (Call Session Control Function) does not sit on the border between the access network and the core network...
It does sit in the IMS sub network, which is pass the Core-Network itself... It is true though that in case of the P-CSCF it is an IMS, which is associated with the geographic Access and core (PS domain) networks, in which the user is currently roaming ( a special case would be his home network..). Also the P-CSCF is a 'real SIP proxy server' too... You may compare it to an local outbound SIP proxy server. Actually if BIS2543 have had also a local inbound proxy server then we would have said the P-CSCF mimics the functionality of both local SIP proxy servers..

Still your intention is of course good and helpful :)

It would probably be better to ask those that wrote the recommendation. Nevertheless, I
don't see this as an argument either as B could just keep the port open for a while, e.g.
until it gets the 200 OK. regardless of whether it was specified as a separate media
stream in the SDP or not.

Again, I do not think this is always "the best thing" mainly because for
each fax call (and the entire duration of the fax transmission), 2 DSP
channels are used and worse depending on the complexity of the codec that
was selected for voice.
When you have a large DSP pool in a big fat gateway, you may think it is ok.
When you have a small enterprise gw with limited number of ports (8 for
example), you do not want fax calls to litteraly "block" voice calls because
the fax calls suck all the dsp resources.
=> so, and to shut down this specific point in the thread, I'll repeat:
both should be allowed in our Internet-Draft.

There are pros and cons for both methods and I don't think we should force a
decision on this now.  The SIP T.38 call flows will show both options.  We
should leave that to vendors' implementations and see if it does cause
interop issues - I bet it does not unless your implementation does not
support multiple media connections per session.

Agreeing on a common approach does not mean removing the other ones from the
internet-draft, right?

Based on our thread, I do not see any reason for updating the ITU-T T.38
recommendation ("recommendation") but many good reasons to update the SIP
T.38 Internet-Draft.

My goal is to collect all the good comments and submit an updated draft for
your review this week.  I'd propose to mute this thread on the points we've
beaten until then.

first of, I believe most of the fax call are terminated when fax is over.
For the cases where audio connection is required at the end of fax, we will
see the interop issues at the bake-off and revise the draft accordingly,
right?

To me, the most persuasive reason is to book the DSP resources for not much
at the end...
As far as QoS, why would'nt your QoS decision/enforcement points recognize
the codec used or whether you're muting the channel to make appropriate
choices...

I'm trying to remain neutral in this discussion because I believe both
should be allowed even though, as implementors, I have a preference based on
the target application...
A good argument for maintaining 2 connections: let's forget the pstn handles
fax on one physical line - this is the source of  the pb.  Let's think not
about replicating the way the PSTN handles this.
New kinds of IP terminals should allow users to speak while sending the fax
if end-users desire to.  We must not limit speech only when fax is over.
This, to me, is a SUFFICIENT reason.

      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is wrong.  No matter what transport is used for voice, one single
stream *can* be used when switching to fax.

No.
In H.323 provides 2 H.245 commands to control the logical channels,
Replacementfor and RequestMode.  A similar debate applies to H.323, MGCP,
...

I had sent comments to Glen Parsons.  Upon update of the new draft, we'll
send follow-up.

--=====================_12013063==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Hi,

There is a very simple way to remove the dependency of manyfolks on the bis 
draft.

Simply change the behavior in manyfolks such that 180/181/182 with 
preconditions means "I will ring/alert/notify the phone _as soon as my 
preconditions are satisfied_."

Only a few lines of text need to be replaced:

(from Section 8.1):
>Upon receipt of the COMET message, the UAC/UAS continues normal SIP
>    call handling, by (for a UAS) alerting the user and sending e.g. a
>    180-Ringing or 200-OK response.
     --->
"Upon receipt of the COMET message (or the 200 response to the COMET), the 
UAS (or UAC) continues normal SIP call handling, by performing the action 
normally associated with sending or recieving the 18x provisional response 
(e.g. for a 180, the UAC plays local ringback and the UAS alerts the user)."

(from Section 9.1)
>At this point it alerts the user, and sends a 180-
>Ringing provisional response.  This provisional response is also
>sent using the reliability mechanism of [12], resulting in a PRACK
>message and 200-OK of the PRACK.
--> "At this point it alerts the user.  Upon receipt of the 200 response to 
the COMET, the UAC generates local ringback."

Also replace: "183-Session-Progress" with "18x".

If these small changes are made, the example flow already in the draft will 
still work (because the 183 has empty semantics, no action is postponed; 
the subsequent 180 will cause ringback immediately because preconditions 
are already satisfied).  Also the shorter flow shown below will also work.

         |                       ACK                     |
         |---------------------------------------------->|

Ringing and Ringback are delayed from * until ** . The Terminating UAS 
rings the phone when the COMET arrives.  The Originating UAC plays local 
ringback when the 200 OK to the COMET arrives.

Please consider this proposal.  I feel this is both useful technically, as 
well as an ideal short-cut around more process-related delay.

thanks,
-rohan

If it's just a particular call flow that shows fax detect based on V.21 fax
preamble rather then T.30 CNG, then that's fine. If the text on the other hand
says that in general you shall not switch based on CNG, then that's problematic,
and I believe that's the way the current text reads.

Well, that's how SIP normally works.

I suppose that's another way of solving that. I personally think it's just
muddying the picture a little, but it's your I-D.

And that's the problem. There will be lots of devices out there that will not
want to support more than one media stream at a time. Considering this is to be
a BCP and you want to specify something that's interoperable, I'd strongly
suggest that the mono-media solution is considered the base-line that all
implementations should be expected to support. For those more sophisticated
types of devices that allow you to send faxes and continue talking at the same
time, I have no problem specifying a multi-media call flow that adds an extra
active stream, however do note, that this is different from what has been
discussed so far, which was a single active media stream.

Hi All,

	We are having a hard time trying to figure out how to make the
Transferee send the Invite to the Transfer Target through the proxy when
REFER is used to transfer the call. Could you shed some light on how this 
can be achieved.

Transferee	    Transferor       Proxy		Transfer Target

Invite|--------------------------->
      |<----------------------- 100 Trying
      |             <---------- Invite
      |         200 -------------->
      |<----------------------- 200
Ack   |--------------------------->
      |             <---------- Ack
      |        Invite(c=0)-------->
      |<----------------------- Invite(c=0)
200 Ok|--------------------------->
      |             <---------- 200 Ok
      |         Ack -------------->
      |<----------------------- Ack
      |            Invite(TT)----->
      |                         Invite ------------->
      |                           <--------------- 200
      |                 <-------- 200
      |        Ack	-------------->
      |                           Ack -------------->
      |        Bye	 -------------> 
      |                           Bye -------------->
      |                           <--------------- 200
      |                 <-------- 200
      |        Refer  ------------>
      |<------------------------- Refer
200 Ok|--------------------------->
      |            <------------- 200 OK
Invite|--------------------------------------------->
      |<------------------------------------------- 200 Ok
Ack   |--------------------------------------------->
Bye   |--------------------------------------------->
      |<------------------------------------------- 200 Ok

	We would like to see the last Invite and Bye go through the proxy
too
so that the proxy can control that call. Would a Record-Route in the Refer
help me achieve this goal ? Or a route header embedded in the referred-to 
header ? Is the transferor mandated to use the route header thus provided?

    Is there anybody out there that has implemented supervised call transfer
using the Refer method so that the proxy is involved in the messaging for
all
the three calls? If so, we would appreciate to find out how you accomplished
this (in a billable manner).

TIA,
Ragunath/Shriram.

That would imply that you give up the old (audio) reservation then, however I'd
rather not turn this into a QoS discussion.

I agree, but that is indeed also a multi-media call (two active media streams),
which is not what has been discussed so far.

Anoud, I believe the speficiation allows the behaviour that you are
describing. However, some proxy implementations may not allow it.

Personally, I believe that a user-service proxy should be able to map
multiple URLs (a@b, c@d) to a single user profile, which may REACT
differently to the request depending on the original request-URI. But that's
just may, and implementations will vary.

Implementation-specific discussions should of course be deferred to the
sip-implementors list.

I agree with the principle of favoring stateless
proxies over stateful proxies. But there are cases
where you need to store state in the network. In the
particular 3GPP scenarios you mention, I don't believe
scalability is at risk. Performance, yes, but not
scalability. Reliability is of course an issue. Do
you move reliability into the endpoints or leave it
in the network? You can argue for both cases.

The problem is exactly as you stated: storing this
information in the terminal and retransmitting it
over the air interface.

Bandwidth is one concern here. Delay is another.
Delay is of course a function of the amount of data
transmitted.

The choice of SIP is now fixed. We are working to
utilize SIP in the best manner possible while
working within the constraints of a wireless network.
This is a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity
for the SIP community. Given the projected growth of
3G terminals, 3G could potentially do more for the
spread of SIP than anything else to date.

One thing the ADs and many senior contributors have taken the chairs "out
behind the barn" for is making more effective use of meeting time.

We have rather exlicit orders not to repeat the "two minutes and then we
hum" format of the last meeting.

The basic idea is to use the very valuable face-to-face meeting time for
working out the hard stuff, not for updating status or proposing new work.
We're now the busiest group in the IETF, and we need to start working
smarter. More on that later . . .

So, I ask all of you who are considering a slot request for SIP WG at IETF
50 to consider:

1) Is your topic this a "hotly debated issue" or is it a status work or a
proposal for a new project?

2) Can your need be effectively met by list discussion? If not, what would
it take (moderation, tracking, whatever) to make the mailing list an
effective forum for your needs?

3) How can we help?


Thanks.

I have been doing some working through the table 4 and 5 in the RFC2543 and
the bis draft, and looking at how the various SIP extensions affect this.

I come to the following conclusions:

i)	when and if the SIP bis draft ever gets accepted as an RFC, we are
going to have to a lot of work (much of it technical rather than editorial)
on the extension drafts to make them reference the bis draft, rather than
RFC2543.

ii)	currently there is potential conflict between some of the extensions
in what they say in terms of the usage of various headers and methods, for
example we have method definitions that apparently say they are special, and
a lot of headers are not required, and header extensions that say the
extensions are appropriate to all methods including ACK.

iii)	there also seems to be some inconsistency in the way the authors of
the various extensions have treated these tables in completing them.

I think some work therefore needs to be done in this area. I would like to
at least propose the following:

-	That all extensions include editor's notes to specify text that can
be removed at IESG review time. This will give additional text or
replacement text that allows the extension to refer to the bis draft rather
than RFC2543, and will allow a ready view of what needs to be updated as and
when the bis draft becomes an RFC.

-	That a volunteer should identify the required extensions or changes
to the INFO method RFC to allow it to refer to the bis draft.

-	That the guidelines document should contain text on how table 4 and
5 should be extended by any SIP extension, particularly in relation to that
SIP extension and any other extension that has already been published or is
in progress. I would note that some extensions which add either headers or
methods do not include the extension material to table 4 and 5, and none of
the extensions which do provide this material indicate what is appropriate
in relation to the INFO header, which is in an extension that is now an RFC.


-	Presumably a sense of honour and spirit of benevolence will then
cause all extension authors to follow these guidelines!!!!!


I would be happy with any different set of actions that allows consistency
between the bis draft and the various extensions when the bis draft gets
published.

I have noted a number of apparent errors in the use of these tables and will
publish these to the list in separate mails.

Comments please.

If I understand your point correctly, and which drafts you are referring to,
then I have to reply that 3GPP are not looking at SIP for mobility, merely
to use SIP for session control in a mobile environment.

Mobility management in 3GPP release 5 will be handled by the underlying
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) alothough more other IP strategies are
being looked at for future releases.

Also the mobility related drafts expired some time ago, and I have not noted
much interest in reviving them (a comment that is invariably a prelude to
screams of protest!!!).

It requires some additional signalling, but I would not say
that it is hard.  It is not as complicated as building a B2BUA that
has to deal with the state and scale of every ringing phone in an
environment.  One not well thought out means: proxy could do a
short lived implied or explicit SUBSCRIBE and get a NOTIFY
from the registrar with additional contacts as added.  I think the
proxy/registrar is the correct place for this feature.

I am with you on this.  There is a great danger that B2BUAs start
getting stuffed into networks where proxys are more appropriate.
It then gets harder and harder to allow two end points  to send
messages without content and headers getting filtered out or
mucked up by B2BUAs in the middle which do not explicitly
support the extensions of the end points.

We were planning on supporting pickup in our UA using this technique.
Of course if no proxy/registrars support it we are just one hand
clapping.

Must a registration interval have a ceiling? I.e. Can I have my SIP phone at home be registered for ever (say as my default SIP phone) while other SIP phones I use on a temporary basis (i.e. the SIP phone at office or Lab) would be typically registered at the registrar for a limited period of time?

hello,
This is fine except for a minor change in the BNF.

The opening ' [ ' should be before the semicolon

Referred-By      = ("Referred-By" | "b") ":" referrer-url  [ ";"

This is covered by the text stating that user parameters of
the URI must match and if any URI components are omitted you 
match against it's default value. (Section 2.1, 3rd bullet 
point)

User has no default value defined, so for the SIP URLs:
    sip:bar.com
    sip:foo@bar.com
you compare an 'empty user/null' with 'foo' which obviously don't
match.

Cheers,
Neil.

It is true though that in case of the P-CSCF it is an IMS, which is associated with the geographic Access and core (PS domain) networks, in which the user is currently roaming ( a special case would be his home network..). Also the P-CSCF is a 'real SIP proxy server' too... You may compare it to an local outbound SIP proxy server. Actually if BIS2543 have had also a local inbound proxy server then we would have said the P-CSCF mimics the functionality of both local SIP proxy servers..

Thanks for the further info Uri, however please allow me to 
now be a little bit picky with your comments too ;)

I have seen these comparisons in presentations on SIP and 3GPP 
and I think it is a over simplification which has potential to 
mislead. The functionality potentially being placed in a P-CSCF 
would make it a very different 'Proxy Server' to any you would 
conclude from reading RFC 2453bis. An example is the possible 
proposed behaviour of a P-CSCF on an incoming call - the 'local 
inbound proxy server' role. It appears possible that the P-CSCF 
may be expected to remove all Via headers and only pass a 
locally unique token on to the called party. There are quite a 
few other differences too. :PLEASE NOTE: I am not saying this 
sort of thing is right or wrong within the 3GPP. Though I do 
have general concerns that the proposed architecture is heading 
towards a networks of B2B UAs which would be wrong. I just think 
that as the two communities engage we need to ensure we fully 
understand each others terminology.

Cheers,
Neil

It is really at the discretion of the registrar. You can request 
as long a period as you wish but the registrar can always
indicate
a shorter expiry time in the response. See bis 02 section
4.2.6.4.

BTW this question probably belonged on the SIP Implementers List.

Well 1hr for sip urls and forever for non sip urls, although the registrar
may shorten any registration it receives so the expires in the response must
be checked.

Not in Germay it doesn't. The dial plan is so open that not even the
terminating switch knows how many digits there are going to be - it's only
the CPE that knows.

Overlap sending is certainly used on almost all calls in the UK - admittedly
not because it has to, but more because it has always been done that way.

Hi,
 
Perhaps I'm missing something. The notes seemed to indicate that SDP SHOULD
NOT be sent backwards before the 200 OK, but you are indicating that the
ability to have *backwards* media path is still available before the 200 OK.
 
I know that in many scenarios, the backwards SDP is not required in order to
allow backwards media, but we are surely not making this a blanket
assumption ? What about when there is QoS reservation going on, does the
manyfolks mechanism provide a way of sending the SDP backwards which is not
subject to the SHOULD NOT discussed at the meeting ?
 
Apologies if I've just misunderstood ?
 
Regards,
 
Mark

Gee, I HOPE not.
 
Real world scenarios -- my office uses only SIP phones with a PSTN gateway
for outside communications. The first "hello" is almost universally clipped.
Most annoying.
 
My recollection of recent discussion of basic call flows (no special "early
media") is that the UAC SHOULD be ready to receive media at the time the
INVITE is transmitted. It SHOULD not send media until after it has sent ACK
in response to a 200 OK.

All, 

The notes from the meeting earlier this month seem to indicate an agreement
to deprecate early media i.e. to include a SHOULD NOT in respect of media
before the 200 OK of the INVITE.

Is this a correct understanding of what was agreed ? 

I seem to remember this issue being discussed extensively on this list late
last year and there were strong feelings expressed against changing the
semantics of the 200 response to the INVITE. Presently it corresponds to
called party answer, but the change above would alter this.

Was a solution to these concerns also identified at the meeting ? 

Does this deprecation apply to the setting up of the media path before 200
OK for QoS assurance, or just when the intention is to play the backwards
media to the caller ?

Mark Watson

    <P><FONT size=2>The notes from the meeting earlier this month seem to

I don't think you have a ceiling on the registaration interval. You can
register your
SIP phone for ever (well almost by specifying a very high value in the
expires). The default
interval however happens to be 2 hr.

yes it can be done

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Digest Authentication in SIP using RADIUS
	Author(s)	: B. Sterman
	Filename	: draft-sterman-sip-radius-00.txt
	Pages		: 7
	Date		: 26-Feb-01
	
This document examines the proposal for a SIP extension to allow 
authentication of a user-agent through a proxy to a RADIUS server 
using CHAP put forward by Byerly and Williams [BYERLY]. An 
alternative method is offered which does not require any changes to 
the SIP protocol as defined in [SIP]. It also will not require any 
modification to the way RADIUS clients communicate with RADIUS
Servers [RADIUS], although it will change the way some of the
fields are interpreted by the RADIUS server.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sterman-sip-radius-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-sterman-sip-radius-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-sterman-sip-radius-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Keith:

You are correct -- 3GPP and AT&T Wireless is not looking at SIP for mobility
in R5; we are using GPRS for mobility management in R5. We do not believe
the SIP mobility-related drafts are of interest for R5.

If I understand your point correctly, and which drafts you are referring to,
then I have to reply that 3GPP are not looking at SIP for mobility, merely
to use SIP for session control in a mobile environment.

Mobility management in 3GPP release 5 will be handled by the underlying
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) alothough more other IP strategies are
being looked at for future releases.

Also the mobility related drafts expired some time ago, and I have not noted
much interest in reviving them (a comment that is invariably a prelude to
screams of protest!!!).

and for what it's worth, 3GPP2 is using Mobile IP as its mobility management
protocol, and does not currently have any plans to use SIP as a mobility
management protocol.

That is exactly the Bis02 section which made me concerned...
Say I want to register the FQDN (Host name) or either IP address of my SIP
phone at home as my 'permanent' contact.
Does that fall under the definition of a SIP URL and thus forbidden or other
URL and thus is OK?
I mean is it just a matter of 'tricking' the registrar and providing it my
'contact' information as a non SIP URL?
e.g. SIP:user1@myMachine.sip.xxx.com => myMachine.sip.xxx.com

This is still not a reason to do overlap.  Collect all of the digits
at the UA (or at the gateway) and send them en bloc.  If the terminating
CPE doesn't have enough to connect, send PSPD treatment.  If it does
connect.  If the caller doesn't know how many digits to provide, they're
hosed anyway.

This is really a numbering plan issue (more for the likes of ENUM)
rather than a SIP issue.  If a numbering plan routing database cannot
provide information concerning the minimum and maximum number of digits
to collect and when to go into short timing, what will ever provide it?
Digit by digit collection is not a solution.  If the CPE knows the
private dial plan, it should export that numbering plan information to
the network in the form of a dial plan usable at the gateway.  If not
part of a numbering plan, it should at least be part of registration.
The only reason this persists in the PSTN is because of the inability
of terminating equipment to communicate with the network and the
unwillingness of operators to make up for it with manual provisioning.

Would you suggest that we overlap from SIP UA to PSTN as well?

Convert from overlap to en bloc at the gateway.  Noone is questioning
whether a gateway should accept SAMs, just don't propagate them through
the SIP network.

   While it's hard to tell whether my hearsay understanding
   of CSCF is screwed up, or whether it's just the 
   general murkiness of all of this, I was under
   the impression that the CSCF was more akin to
   a proxy bolted to a B2BUA.

   If this is still the case, I'd say that both
   scalability, but more importantly *robustness*
   are at issue. Not to mention e2e transparency.

   Sure, but fate sharing is very nice property.
   The CSCF isn't fate shared and that's troubling.

   I'm having a hard time understanding what
   constraints that the wireless network would
   put on doing this right (ie, the handsets are
   real, not crippled, UA's). I got the impression
   that this was born out of some weird
   assumptions of garden walls, rationalized with
   a helping of "phones too stupid."

Rohan,

Your approach was certainly considered; the main problem was
a UAS that doesn't ring -- it would then send a 200-OK that
means "I will complete the call _as soon as my preconditions
are satisfied_."  Now there is no way to signal an error, and
all the semantics of media flow timings are different.

Further, it means the manyfolks-based-on-2543 would have
different call flows than manyfolks-based-on-bis; not desirable.

Seems much better to slightly increase the documentation, and
keep the semantics of each message the same as the draft
had previously defined.

I expect the updated draft will be out shortly....

Subject: removing the bis draft dependency from manyfolks
Cc: sip@lists.bell-labs.com, rohan@cisco.com

Hi,

There is a very simple way to remove the dependency of manyfolks on the bis 
draft.

Simply change the behavior in manyfolks such that 180/181/182 with 
preconditions means "I will ring/alert/notify the phone _as soon as my 
preconditions are satisfied_."

Only a few lines of text need to be replaced:

(from Section 8.1):
>Upon receipt of the COMET message, the UAC/UAS continues normal SIP
>    call handling, by (for a UAS) alerting the user and sending e.g. a
>    180-Ringing or 200-OK response.
     --->
"Upon receipt of the COMET message (or the 200 response to the COMET), the 
UAS (or UAC) continues normal SIP call handling, by performing the action 
normally associated with sending or recieving the 18x provisional response 
(e.g. for a 180, the UAC plays local ringback and the UAS alerts the user)."

(from Section 9.1)
>At this point it alerts the user, and sends a 180-
>Ringing provisional response.  This provisional response is also
>sent using the reliability mechanism of [12], resulting in a PRACK
>message and 200-OK of the PRACK.
--> "At this point it alerts the user.  Upon receipt of the 200 response to 
the COMET, the UAC generates local ringback."

Also replace: "183-Session-Progress" with "18x".

If these small changes are made, the example flow already in the draft will 
still work (because the 183 has empty semantics, no action is postponed; 
the subsequent 180 will cause ringback immediately because preconditions 
are already satisfied).  Also the shorter flow shown below will also work.

Ringing and Ringback are delayed from * until ** . The Terminating UAS 
rings the phone when the COMET arrives.  The Originating UAC plays local 
ringback when the 200 OK to the COMET arrives.

Please consider this proposal.  I feel this is both useful technically, as 
well as an ideal short-cut around more process-related delay.

thanks,
-rohan

To end this thread properly:
Flemming, Bert and Christer: we would like to thank you for all the
comments.  As you have seen in the preliminary draft01 text, we believe the
major comments have been addressed:
 - fax stream: the replacement of audio stream by fax stream which was
really the only call flow in draft00 is the recommended one; a multi-media
call flow has been added to illustrate the t38 annex D recommendations,
 - several call flows have been added accordingly,
 - section 4 has been completely rewritten and addresses your comments: CNG
may trigger fax detection, CED must not be used to trigger fax switch-over,
 - the text has been clarified on the voice muting and msg details updated.

We look forward to receiving more comments on draft01 and, more importantly,
to demonstrating the true value of this BCP  draft in the interop events,
Jean-Francois.
Clarent Corp.

Of course the caller knows how many digits they have. The problem =
occurs
when they have no way to indicate end-of-dialling to their equipment.

Of course whenever we can we will collect all the digits and go en-bloc =
from
there, but there remain cases where we simply cannot determine
end-of-dialling.

Our experience has universally been that our customers (service =
providers)
are not happy with using an inter-digit timer to guess when =
end-of-dialling
has occured - hence the need for overlap.

Believe me, I do not *want* to support overlap. If there was any way of
avoiding the requirement altogether, I would do so. The unfortunate =
fact is
that there exist scenarios where overlap is the only way of meeting our
customers requirements.

Yes, and the fact that the manual provisioning required is, in certain
cases, completely impractical, or even impossible because the operator =
does
not have the information about number lengths in the PBXs.


> Would you suggest that we overlap from SIP UA to PSTN as well?

If you mean a 'real' UA (rather than a PSTN gateway), then no. I expect =
that
true SIP UAs will provide a means for the user to indicate =
end-of-dialling,
or indeed require the user to indicate end-of-dialling.

Mark

Indeed, it is exactly a sub/not mechanism thats needed. Its a pretty complex
one, though, in  terms of scalability. Basically, every single active
transaction through a proxy needs to generate a subcsription from the
transaction, towards the registrar, for those registrations used to proxy
the call. This means that your subscription count scales with the number of
simultaneous transactions through the proxy. Yuck. Note that this is the
case even when the registrar/proxy are co-located. In this case, the
communication is between software components in the same process, but the
need is identical.

Is it harder than a B2BUA? Hard to say.

I think that can work; you need to be careful about what Contact URI you
place in the REGISTER for directed pickups. It can't be the same thing you
put in REGISTER for receiving normal phone calls.

Not really. THere is more state, yes. But, we don't have the other drawbacks
of the MGCP approach. Thats a separate flame war that I'd rather not start.

The drawbacks in terms of scalability, reliability and performance of a
B2BUA are well known (at least, I hope they are), so I think that will cause
people to think a bit before using a B2BUA when a proxy will do.

That aside, there are just lots of services that can't be done any other
way. Perhaps call park isn't one of them, and thats fine. I do recall
someone posted a note on why the mechanism in rfc2543 was not call pickup,
for many reasons. I couldn't find the note in the archive, so maybe I just
imagined it. 

Anyway, the issue at hand is twofold:

1. should the spec say anything about call pickup

   Given our trend not to define services, I would say no. 

2. should the spec still have this capability of sending a register in the

All,

I plan to add the corrected call flow (forking INVITE instead of CANCEL) to the
new draft of the Service Examples so we can all take a look at the details -
such as the Request-URI of the REGISTER as Jonathan points out.

The conversation on this thread has been moving between several different
via header issues. It was my understanding that via mucking was happening in
two places:

1. P-CSCF removes via, RR before sending an INVITE to a called party, to
save bits on the air. This requires transaction stateful proxies to restore
the information in the response. No call-statefulness required.

2. I-CSCF will encrypt the via headers, and record-routes, to avoid exposing
the information outside the network.


Please note that via hiding was removed from the spec primarily because of a
security issue. The element that wanted the encryption needed to ask the
next hop, possibly in a different domain, to perform it. Encryption and
hiding can still be done in a number of ways, none of which require
standardization. Some of them can be done statelessly.

The issue with bandwidth has to do only with the P-CSCF removal of via and
RR headers.

I've seen this requirement for hiding from wireline providers as well - not
because the number of servers is sensitive information to be hidden from
competitors - but because of hackers. The primary issue, in my mind, is
allowing outside parties to learn the IP address of servers within the
network. Once that happens, lots of tools are at their disposal to attack
these machines. Given that phone companies have historically been a favorite
attack point for hackers, and given that these attacks are much easier when
we are talking voip, I think paranoia is a good thing here.

That depends entirely on the implementation.

Any hiding mechanism that is transaction stateful will suffer from
robustness problems, and call stateful mechanisms will be even worse. If
done statelessly (which is possible), you get the robustness benefits
stateless proxies can offer. 

I think loop detection is generally going to suffer. A complex
implementation might look for a spiraled request, and when it sees one,
attempt to locate/decrypt the hidden headers to look for a loop. That may or
may not be possible depending on how the hiding is implemented.

These providers should be informed that they are clueless :-) There are
port scanners around that search millions of IP addresses very quickly,
automatically and without the hacker lifting a finger. Thus, this offers
almost no protection, except assuring PHBs that "yes, we're hiding our
network".

Is this because of concern of the delay in setup ?
As discussion on this thread has shown,supporting overlap within the SIP model,
whether using the
INFO method or multiple INVITEs,  is going to lead to a lot more processing than
just the sending of the extra digits, E.g., waiting for responses, processing
ACKs,
AAA procedures, all of which may  be a bigger drag on setup than
waiting for an EOD timer to mature. Add to that the administrative issues of
making sure
that networks to which yours connects supports the SIP procedures necessary to
make overlap work
the way your network wants it to work and we introduce a lot of extra complexity
for no discernable gain.

Regards,

Keith.

Of course the caller knows how many digits they have. The problem occur=
s
when they have no way to indicate end-of-dialling to their equipment.

Of course whenever we can we will collect all the digits and go en-bloc=
 from
there, but there remain cases where we simply cannot determine
end-of-dialling.

Our experience has universally been that our customers (service provide=
rs)
are not happy with using an inter-digit timer to guess when end-of-dial=
ling
has occured - hence the need for overlap.

Believe me, I do not *want* to support overlap. If there was any way of=

avoiding the requirement altogether, I would do so. The unfortunate fac=
t is
that there exist scenarios where overlap is the only way of meeting our=

customers requirements.

Yes, and the fact that the manual provisioning required is, in certain
cases, completely impractical, or even impossible because the operator =
does
not have the information about number lengths in the PBXs.


> Would you suggest that we overlap from SIP UA to PSTN as well?

If you mean a 'real' UA (rather than a PSTN gateway), then no. I expect=
 that
true SIP UAs will provide a means for the user to indicate end-of-diall=
ing,
or indeed require the user to indicate end-of-dialling.

Mark

True, the 3GPP expectation for the P-CSCF being call stateful 
must come from elsewhere. I'ld like to learn more about exactly
why this is thought to be needed, it is definitely in the docs.

There is the idea of storing state in the P-CSCF for things 
like return-call service to caller-id blocked calls. Although 
caller-id blocking is another can of worms without using a 
B2BUA as an anonymizer.

The trusted next hop was one of the security issues that lead 
to the deprecation of Via hiding. But another was just false 
impression of security doing this could create for the naive as
hiding a box's IP doesn't make it secure. After all old style 
Via hiding could have 'worked' within a single providers 
network where the servers could trust each other.

Yeah that bothers me with the potential for complex service 
based routing in the future. I remember the time when our proxy 
had to look through Via headers figuring out if it could 
decrypt any before doing loop detection. Not pretty.

Well, there is a big difference. With the port scans, you find a device, but
don't necessarily know what it does or why you might want to beat it up.
Without via hiding, an attacker can know what the device is (a proxy), what
provider its with, what calls get routed through it, and so on. It makes for
much more selective, focused attacks.

Scan for TCP port 5060 and you'll know it's a proxy. You'll know the IP
address range by looking at the packet to your 3GPP device (or the
public allocations and domain names). I agree Via hiding makes the work
somewhat more difficult, but I doubt that it offers any real protection,
given other leakage (such as Record-Route) and other ways to find out
things (max-forward).

My primary concern is that 3GPP seems to be mandating architectures that
are, at best, useful for a subset of providers and scenarios, imposing
complexity on everyone.

I think the most correct statement is that "URL parameters that have no
default value are ignored for purposes of comparison if they are not present
in both URLs". This covers unknown parameters as well as a few of the known
ones.

Call statefulness is required for the BYE. In order for the
P-CSCF to insert the proper Route: in the BYE, it must maintain
call state. This is not the *only* reason the P-CSCF maintains
call state however.

As well, of course, as the removal of the need for the

Robustness is then left in the hands of the UA. 
I'm not saying that is a bad thing. That is the Internet
model after all. But it is a tradeoff.

Spiralling between operator's networks is the complex case that
needs to be handled. This definitely needs more investigation.

Hi, 
I was looking for a workaround for the NAT/firewall
problem concerning RTP flows when the UA *knows* it
is not capable of creating a "good" SDP description.
In particular I was wondering if there's a way 
to avoid the deployment of a B2BUA and stick with a 
vanilla proxy. So the question is: what if UAs 
could "declare" in an header the address they'll need, 
in order to let SIP proxies allocate an address and 
return it to the sender? For instance, if "caller@a.com" 
wants to call "callee@b.com" the message flow could be:

caller@x.a.com    proxy.a.com        
      |                 |                
      |-------M1------->|                
      |<------M2--------|                
      |-------M3------->|                 

M1:
INVITE sip:callee@b.com SIP/2.0
...
Address-Request: 10.0.0.1:24445;transport=udp
...
c=IN IP4 10.0.0.1
...

M2:
SIP/2.0 4xx Address Needs Translation
...
Address-Request:
100.0.0.1:24445;transport=udp;map=163.162.3.19:1029;expires=3600
...

M3:
INVITE sip:callee@b.com SIP/2.0
...
Address-Request: 10.0.0.1:24445;transport=udp;map=163.162.3.19:1029
...
c=IN IP4 163.162.3.19
...

And so on. Of course this requires also a new request method 
to let the callee allocate its address[es] (it can't do it within
the INVITE transaction, because it can't receive a response from
the proxy). This new method could also be useful to reallocate the 
same addresses or if this operation requires some kind of
authentication. 

This SIP-extension should work even if the message body is not SDP, and
has
no side effects when one of the two peers does not understand it.
It works when there are one or more NATs and/or firewalls (if an RTP
proxy
is also deployed): it looks too good to be true. What I'm missing?

	Thanks in advance.
		Alberto.

True, 
but sofar I understand now. a SIP message that leaves a P-CSCF will leave its own address in the topmost VIA header.
So, evil hackers can intercept it before the SIP message is received by the proxy of the other network.(before next hop)
(probably by cutting the cable :-)since the mobile operator may hope that the other network does encrypt the VIA header of the SIP message that passes the bordering proxy of that network.


About Portscans, there are enough programs that prevent proxies to respond back to a portscan. That is known as Stealth mode of the ports.

Well, there is a big difference. With the port scans, you find a device, but
don't necessarily know what it does or why you might want to beat it up.
Without via hiding, an attacker can know what the device is (a proxy), what
provider its with, what calls get routed through it, and so on. It makes for
much more selective, focused attacks.

The WG chairs and the ADs were talking this morning about how to make the
working group more effective.One idea that came up sounds interesting, and
I'd like to share it with you.

There are really two sorts of tasks that happen in the WG today:

1) Defining the protocol: SIP and extensions to SIP using its extension
mechanisms.

2) Describing the mechanisms and requirements of doing useful things with
SIP.

Many of the discussions over the past years have started as
application-specific extensions that have pointed toward general-purpose
reusable solutions. For example, Message Waiting Indicator proposals led to
our understanding of the general usefulness of Subscribe/Notify (Events)
mechanisms. We sometimes didn't notice the generalizability of a mechanism
until several iterations into implementation discussions (Refer). We've
started to learn to differentiate our drafts between protocol specifics and
usage rationales. Unfortunately, sometimes the "how could we" discussions
have distracted from the immediate goals of completing the base
specifications. Even the core protocol draft has drawn criticism for
intermixing usage and specification, and the authors have proposed a rewrite
to separate those components.

So here's the idea: What if we were to split the SIP WG into two pieces?
Maybe two WGs?

The first part would handle the actual protocol specifications -- things
like 2543bis, and would deal with new methods, new headers, new response
codes, and other things in response to requirements generated by the second
part. Hard standards-track stuff, tightly controlled charter.

The second part would deal with using SIP, primarily from a
rationale-and-requirements perspective. This would include call flows,
application of SIP mechanisms (like using Events for Message Waiting), and
with things like RFCs to register new  MIME types and DHCP options and the
like. I believe Allison suggested calling such a group the "SIPPING" effort.
Such a group would of course do a lot of discussios and would be likely to
generate several informational  and BCP track documents as well as
standards-track documents where appropriate.

This might let us get a little more clarity in the discussions and
discipline in the process -- and separate some of the topics on the rather
busy mailing list.

So, what do you think?

The ADs have advised the chairs of a preference to move discussions onto
listservs provided by the secretariat. This clears up all sorts of archival
issues going forward.

Over the next few months, we'll be undertaking efforts to relocate the
various SIP discussion lists appropriately. We'll let you know as things
happen.

Just to be real clear, the idea is that the SIPPING group would
probably, in it's work, come up with things that needed to be changed in 
SIP.  If it did, the actual change would be done in the SIP core group.  
The SIPPING group MIGHT do a requirements document, or just hand the problem
off.
All extensions and changes to SIP would be done in the SIP WG.  This might
affect some existing drafts that combine a how/why to accomplish a task
with the actual change/extension to SIP.  Those might have to be split.
The hope is, as Dean point out, to have few, general mechanisms rather than
lots of applications specific thingies.

   Surely you're not talking about the encryption in RFC 1889?

   Help is on the way with draft-ietf-avt-srtp-00 though.

   I believe this, as well as RTCP payload encryption are part
   of the SRTP proposal.

   I would say that it's mostly to do with the lack of 
   integration with MIME more than anything else that
   make the current PGP solution less than adequate.

   I believe that if we can secure e-2-e MIME attachments
   within SIP. The larger question is whether we have a
   single MUST/SHOULD (say, SMIME or PGP in MIME), or
   whether we should allow for several MAY's. I'm conflicted
   by this because although I think that things are already
   way too complex, neither SMIME or PGP allow for Kerberos
   credentials. Ick. The alternate is to allow
   many different kinds of schemes and require
   negotiation... double ick.

   I generally object to hard wiring a
   single authentication/encryption scheme even beyond 
   not allowing Kerberos: it's seems quite possible and
   likely that it's not just end to end authentication that's
   important; we already know that we need to be able to do
   proxy challenges. If we had a single means of creating an
   attachment with the proper authentication credentials
   (possibly encrypted) for whatever entity in the 
   path desires a cryptographically transmogrified
   blob, we would kill two birds with one stone.

   What it seems to me that we need is something
   that is authentication-system neutral for the
   MIME attachments --  sort of in the spirit of
   EAP for PPP. Disclaimer: I do not follow the
   SMIME stuff. However, draft-ietf-smime-symkeydist-02 
   seems to be on the right general track, but 
   there are other possible avenues as well: 
   RFC 2712 describes a means of doing Kerberized
   TLS which basically replaces X.509 credentials
   with Kerberos credentials... same could
   probably be done for SMIME.

   So, unfortunately, I'm pretty deep into
   solution space here, but I do have one question
   which should drag us back into the requirements
   space: is there any encryption/authentication 
   need for which a MIME attachment would *not* be
   suitable as the envelope, given enough
   flexibility with the attachment authentication
   and crypto-systems?

   It sure seems like it would be a clean solution
   to me to allow any proxy/UA to just add an
   attachment which is directed toward something
   else farther downstream of the method or
   response. If nothing else, it would stop all
   of this feature creep of special headers for
   this and that encryption/authentication need.

Could we bring this issue to a head:

Could we ask that those with strongly held opinions compose an email that
states:
	How you want endpoints with dial pads to address another SIP
endpoint:
		One that is a pure SIP device (a SIP phone)
		One that is a gateway to the PSTN 
	What you want changed, in what RFCs or Drafts
	Why your way is the best way

If we can reach consensus quickly, great.  If not, we will
	Schedule some time at the meeting to discuss
	If necessary, form a design team or other subgroup to work it out

I think this is a possible solution but not the only one. There are solutions
which do not require the coordinate translation logic to be built in
SIP proxies. Which I would actually like to avoid as it may have some
tricky side-effects, for example failure if encryption is used or
used outbound proxy is not able to perform a correct translation.
The other solutions could be in order of my preference
1) having a "where am I" service in the access network (which performs
   exactly the same translation logic but enables end-devices to insert
   geo-coordinates)
2) having the translation logic in end-devices

In fact, the syntax above indicates headers. I like the ability to 
specify header field values in URLs. Location information actually
identifies services and this is what URLs are used for in a protocol-
independent manner. For example, it allows the following link to be 
included in a webpage:

  Turkey: 
  Look at    <a href=http://www.hotel.com?latitutude=40N;longitude=32E>hotels</a>
  and call a <a href=sip:reservations@hotel.com?latitutude=40N;longitude=32E>
		reservation office</a>

Well, I see what you mean. See I just mention "... translation in the
visited cellular network..." so it sounds quite generic for me (SIP server,
application server, etc.). I am too new in SIP to suggest the right entity.
Your arguments, anyway, sounds to me quite appropriate.

>The other solutions could be in order of my preference
>1) having a "where am I" service in the access network (which performs

Ummm, are you suggesting not to include the location info. in the session
establishment but to offer a server in the visited network to perform
location queries? This is LCS, and for some scenarios it is the best
option. Anyway any realtime response will depend on the location technology
deployed in the visited network (assisted GPS, triangulation takes some
seconds, Cell-Id doesnt)

>2) having the translation logic in end-devices

Does it mean the translation is to be performed on the end-device that
establishes the call?


Probably the easiest scenario would be
a)to offer a public match between Cell-Ids and geographical coordinates
b)include in the Cell-Ids structure the geographical coordinates

Anyway no Cellular Operator has offered such information as far as i know.
By the way visited operators could change slightly the geographical
coordinates every time a Cell-Id is translated in order to hide the exact
position of their radio systems to competitors. That's more or less what
the US goverment used to do with GPS in every positioning query:(



For everyone interested in location staff, i would recommend to read the
different scenarios described in LCS architecture (mobile originated
queries, third party originated queries, call-related, non-call-related)
and also the ones covered by CAMEL Phase 3 (subscription to Presentity and
location-changes) and SoLSA (location-based billing). Every different
scenario requires different performance in terms of accuracy, traffic
volume, real time constraints, authorisation, etc. and also targets
different needs. LCS is primary for E911, so LCS servers do not handle
heavy traffic, are more focused on accuracy rather than real-time. CAMEL
Phase 3 is based on Cell-Id and offers call-related location info, presence
& location-change notifications, so CAMEL "servers" will handle heavy
traffic, are more focused on real-time rather than accuracy. SoLSA covers
location-based billing and is a more network-centric vision than the
others.

I must agree with you.

By the way, SIP proxies can change URLs. Is that correct?
3GPP seems to have defined a kind of Visited Proxy Server/Outbound Proxy :)
Anyway, as you mention, visited network real time translation is not the
best solution with encryption scenarios

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: Mapping of ISUP parameters to SIP headers in SIP-T
	Author(s)	: J. Peterson, L. Ong
	Filename	: draft-jfp-sip-isup-header-00.txt
	Pages		: 11
	Date		: 27-Feb-01
	
This document defines procedures within SIP-T for translation of ISUP
call context to SIP call context and vice versa to allow ISUP calls
to pass through SIP networks while preserving feature transparency.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Hi, Dean:

The proposal sounds good to me.

I like to get a little more clarifications. Let us take an example. 

If we start a work in SIPPING WG and find that there needs to an extension
in SIP, should we then bring back that discussion in the SIP WG?

In another example, we have started an effort in SIP-AAA group discussion.
Will that discussion be a part of the SIPPING WG?

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy
AT&T

Subject: [SIP] Proposal for ogranizing WG efforts


The WG chairs and the ADs were talking this morning about how to make the
working group more effective.One idea that came up sounds interesting, and
I'd like to share it with you.

There are really two sorts of tasks that happen in the WG today:

1) Defining the protocol: SIP and extensions to SIP using its extension
mechanisms.

2) Describing the mechanisms and requirements of doing useful things with
SIP.

Many of the discussions over the past years have started as
application-specific extensions that have pointed toward general-purpose
reusable solutions. For example, Message Waiting Indicator proposals led to
our understanding of the general usefulness of Subscribe/Notify (Events)
mechanisms. We sometimes didn't notice the generalizability of a mechanism
until several iterations into implementation discussions (Refer). We've
started to learn to differentiate our drafts between protocol specifics and
usage rationales. Unfortunately, sometimes the "how could we" discussions
have distracted from the immediate goals of completing the base
specifications. Even the core protocol draft has drawn criticism for
intermixing usage and specification, and the authors have proposed a rewrite
to separate those components.

So here's the idea: What if we were to split the SIP WG into two pieces?
Maybe two WGs?

The first part would handle the actual protocol specifications -- things
like 2543bis, and would deal with new methods, new headers, new response
codes, and other things in response to requirements generated by the second
part. Hard standards-track stuff, tightly controlled charter.

The second part would deal with using SIP, primarily from a
rationale-and-requirements perspective. This would include call flows,
application of SIP mechanisms (like using Events for Message Waiting), and
with things like RFCs to register new  MIME types and DHCP options and the
like. I believe Allison suggested calling such a group the "SIPPING" effort.
Such a group would of course do a lot of discussios and would be likely to
generate several informational  and BCP track documents as well as
standards-track documents where appropriate.

This might let us get a little more clarity in the discussions and
discipline in the process -- and separate some of the topics on the rather
busy mailing list.

So, what do you think?

I would say that work started in SIPPING might lead to publication of
requirements and "umbrella" or "framework" documents that would indicate
(perhaps indirectly) the need for a specific extension to SIP. The
requirements would then be referred from SIPPING to SIP, and teh SIP group
would hash out the extension.

AAA work might be a special case. My guess is that the same model could
apply -- requirements work would be done in SIPPING, and any changes or
extensions needed to SIP might be in SIP.

I have submitted updated versions of five dcsgroup drafts;
until they are in the usual places they may be obtained
from
	ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/wtm/draft*

(also in that same place is my genealogy file, marshall.zip,
in case that may be more interesting)

Changes since the last IETF:
  removed references to other internet-drafts, including
	draft-dcsgroup-sip-arch-xx
    and	draft-ietf-sip-2543bis-xx
  some authors have changed companies

Other specific changes are:

draft-ietf-sip-manyfolks-resource-01
	removal of dependencies on 2543bis, specifically
		183 provisional response
		Content-Disposition header
	addition of an option tag for Require and Support headers
	clarified the use of 180 vs. 183 at UAS

draft-ietf-sip-state-01
	changed "host" to "hostport" in syntax

draft-ietf-sip-call-auth-01
	addition of text specifying the handling of the token value
		from the Media-Authorization header

draft-dcsgroup-sip-arch-04
	changes usage of tel: urls, particularly routing number
		and local number portability indication

draft-dcsgroup-sip-proxy-proxy-04
	addition of option tags for each individual new header,
		so a UA/proxy can indicate support for only a subset.
	changes to the Dcs-Billing-ID header to add financial entity ID
	fixes to syntax description of Dcs-Billing-Info

Hi,

An interesting call flow resulted when interacting with a 
Call Agent that does not support CANCELs.

Lets say we have two CAs, one supporting CANCEL and the other
that does not support CANCEL and uses BYE instead.

Hi,

Anyone have any ideas on what to do with a 200 OK to an INVITE that is too large
for a UA to handle (for example, because of a very large route) or that is
malformed?

For a request, there's 413 Request Entity Too Large and 400 Bad Request, easy.
But there's no SIP way to respond to a bad response...

Perhaps NACK instead of ACK? ;-)

Thanks,

Aaron

Hi,

An interesting call flow resulted when interacting with a 
Call Agent that does not support CANCELs.

Lets say we have two CAs, one (A)supporting CANCEL and the 
other (B) that does not support CANCEL and uses BYE instead.
(Support for CANCELs is a "should" not "must" as per bis02)

Do you treat the CANCEL as a "CANCEL" or as a "BYE" ?
	A                       B
      |				|
      |<-----INVITE-----------|
      |-----180-------------->|
      |<-----BYE--------------|
      |------200------------->|
      |				|

Is this legal ?

If we treat it as a BYE, as per bis-02, the INVITE must
be completed with a final response and an ACK ? So will 
the previous flow, result in another 200OK and an ACK for 
that. 

In the other case, when we send the CANCEL, since the 
other CA does not support CANCELs, they drop the CANCELs
and continue to ring the phone after the A has disconnected.

	A                       B
      |				|
      |------INVITE---------->|
      |<-----180--------------|
      |------CANCEL---------->|
      |<-----180--------------|
      |<-----180--------------|
      |				|      				

In this case, should B, send back a 405 Not supported in 
response to a CANCEL ? And should we follow that with a 
BYE and wait for a 200OK. 


Regards
Sharath

Is this such a hard problem? If the operators do not offer this information, 
after-market competitors may possibly do this job as well. There are
actually websites (sorry, I cannot find an illustrating bookmark right
now) that maintain such translation info.

"The Request URI MAY be re-written by proxies". (2543bis, Section 4.3)
