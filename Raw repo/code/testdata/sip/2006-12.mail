Hi,=20

In my case the UA DOES realize that the TCP connection has died, and
creates a new TCP connection.

So, since the UA already knows that a new TCP connection (and therefor a
new NAT binding) has to be created the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS is not needed.

My issue was whether the UA uses the XMA information for something else
than detecting that the binding has changed, but for outbound it seems
like it doesn't, so there is no outbound functionality "suffering" if
the UA doesn't get the XMA.

Regards,

Christer

Paul,

My general concern is about the unpredictability of temporary GRUUs. If the
community is happy that this is good enough for use cases they have in mind,
I can live with it. I just wanted to see whether I was alone in having these
concerns.

Concerning the specific problem you raised at the start of this thread, one
solution might be, when returning a temporary GRUU in a 2xx to a REGISTER
request, to include an integer (as a Contact parameter) that indicates the
number of temporary GRUUs assigned. So if you refresh but too late, you
would see that only one is assigned and that older ones have been lost. This
would avoid subscription to the registration event package, although the
registration event package would bring additional benefits (alerting you
immediately without waiting for the next refresh).

John

Hi Raj,
For first problem, I don't think there is any protocol to find out the 
optimal Media Path. The SDP contact address which they share in INVITE 
and 200 OK will be used for Media transmission.

For second, If you want to send BYE in the same path where your previous 
packets traversed you should have enabled Record-Route at the proxy 
servers. Else BYE will go directly to the contact address which  came in 
200 OK of INVITE(at UAC)  and ACK(at UAS).

Latency depends on a number of factors Raj,

Network speed,
Message size,
Server processing

We are running a broardband based carrier network here with an IMS application server.
A typical invite costs about 25kb and takes ~500ms to call setup.

SDP (session description protocol) information carried in the message 
body of the SIP messages(usually INVITE and its 200 OK response) 
exchanged b/w the two endpoints, explains the terminal capabilities of 
an endpoint to its peer. This SDP also includes the IP address and UDP 
port that will be used for the media packet flow. So once the signaling 
is through, flow of media packets is end to end.

Once the dialog is established, two endpoints communicate directly 
through the URI received in the contact headers. Hence, the bye request 
is sent directly end to end bypassing any proxy.

When two end points want to communicate using SIP, the signalling takes place according to the operation of SIP, but once the signalling is over and when the media channel has to be established, which protocol is used to find the optimal media path?

Hi,

You asked me to clarify my CRLF proposal, so I try to do it here.

I have been exploring ways of rescoping drafts related to Outbound
and simplifying the mechanisms within them since the limitations
of using UDP flows became apparent in this thread. I could vote
for a number of different approaches and would be happy the WG
to agree with at least one of them. Those approaches in my=20
preference order are:

1. Outbound draft to re-scope itself to "Outbound TCP connection"
   draft without any support to UDP, STUN or multiple registrations.
   Multiple registrations and mid-dialog failover (using either TCP
   or UDP) to be specified within another draft.

   - This proposal as such did not raise any discussion=20
     on the list, probably because it would be a dramatic
     change at a quite late stage of the draft.
   - Remarkable changes needed (but I already outlined the
     "Outbound TCP connection" draft within my earlier mail :).
     http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sip/current/msg17495.html

2. Outbound draft to replace STUN keepalive over TCP with CRLF
   keepalive over TCP. (No impact to UDP support of Outbound)

   - This option is equivalent to your formulation, which I
     can very much agree on:

> Clearly you are suggesting that we make CRLF mandatory to implement
> for TCP.  There would be no longer any need to do STUN over TCP and
> therefore no need implement code to deal with stream-based demuxing.
> The text about sigcomp over TCP and STUN over TLS over TCP could
> also go away.

   - Some WG members already expressed their support for this
     option
   - Minor changes needed to the draft

3. Outbound draft to introduce a third optional keepalive method
   for TCP: CRLF (in addition to STUN and TCP keepalives)

   - This option would be the _last resort_ to get at least some
     benefit for TCP-based UA implementation, even if it would
     not help the proxies. Proxies would still have to support
     STUN over TCP.=20
   - Minimal changes needed to the draft


> To clarify are you suggesting that an edge proxy can implement
> outbound without support for UDP flow tokens, without support for STUN
> keepalives over UDP, both, or neither?

My proposals were born "UA centric" as I am from the UA vendor camp.

Anyway if Outbound will specify both UDP and TCP as transport options,
I would believe the proxies still have to support both since the
selection of the transport is basically an UA decision (even if
assisted by DNS SRV) as it depends on if the proxy URI configured
to the UA has a transport parameter. If the proxy would not support=20
UDP & STUN, how could it tell it to the UA ? Outbound would at=20
least need a mechanism for that e.g. a specific response code,=20
option tag or something else. Or is this yet another thing where
Outbound would rely on the UA and DNS configuration to tell the
UA to avoid using UDP ?

Considering the option to drop UDP & STUN support from Outbound
draft: I would agree that combination of UDP and STUN keepalives
does not seem to provide a practical way for NAT traversal. Keeping
UDP flows alive with STUN seems not to add value in comparison
to persistent TCP flows and I could agree dropping UDP flows from
the draft. The only problem I see here that Outbound covers also
the multiregistration mechanism, which could still be useful with
UDP e.g. in cellular access context without NAT/FWs. That is why
I have been proposing re-scoping of the drafts:

- Flow keepalive mechanisms to be specified only for TCP (one draft)
- Protocol agnostic multiregistration mechanism with mid-dialog
  failover support (another draft)

Regards,

Erkki

Exactly.

So, do we really need to specify what other keepalive mechanisms than
STUN can be used then? Can't we simply say that one shall use STUN
unless another mechanism is provided by the transport/security layer?

I was thinking 3GPP, yes :)

Hi,

No matter how we do the keep-alive, I think STUN is a good tool for the
UA to figure out whether it's located behind a NAT in the first place,
by checking the XMA value etc. Again, outbound can be used also in
no-NAT scenarios, so the UA can use the STUN response information to
decide whether it needs to send keep-alives in the first place.

Regards,

Christer

For issue 3, I would say that the solution is to avoid the situation, 
e.g., by registering way in advance before the registration expires. 
Doesn't RFC 3261 recommends to re-register half time before the 
registration timer expires.

Issues 4, 5, and 6 are solved by the reg event. So, shouldn't the GRUU 
draft have a recommendation on the usage of the reg event to solve them?

Miguel,

So to summarize, it seems you are of the belief that the cases where 
these measures may be inadequate are sufficiently obscure to ignore, and 
that new measures to cover the obscure cases are unnecessary. Is that right?

I'm OK with either 1 or 2.

The difference is that with 1 we make it obvious that TCP is better.
With 2, the reader has
to figure it out by himself.=20

The main question is really to decide on one of two mechanisms:

1. use reg-event if you are worried about use cases where this race 
condition can occur (4-6 in Paul's original email)

2. add a parameter to Contact in the register response. Specifically, 
I'd recommend a Contact header field parameter which indicates the time 
at which the first contact with a given instance ID was registered to 
that AOR. This value gets linked with each temp gruu, and when the value 
changes, all of those temp-gruu get invalidated.

Solution (2) is much simpler, but not needed if you think you'll always 
have reg-event anyway. I don't think there is widespread support for 
reg-event on endpoints yet. It is required by IMS.

I am somewhat on the fence on this one. I do worry that reg-event is 
genreally a very heavy solution, and may not see much usage. Option 2 is 
really trivially done, either in gruu or elsewhere. The main issue is 
that it is another late change.

Hi Attila,

This was described in an earlier version of the outbound draft.  The
text from the last version it appeared is below:

thanks,
-rohan

<section title="Double CRLF Processing">
<t>If the SIP server is acting as the TCP client and initiated the TCP
connection (meaning that this host did the active open), then the SIP
server MUST NOT perform any of the processing in this section. The
following only applies when the SIP server is acting as the TCP server
(meaning that this host did the passive open).</t>

<t>When the server receives a CRLF before the start line of a message
on a flow, it MUST send some data back on that same flow within 3
seconds. If no message is actively being sent, it SHOULD send back a
CRLF after waiting at least 1 second. The reason for waiting at least
1 second is that if the other end has an incorrect implementation and
incorrectly echoes the CRLF, this will stop the flow from going into a
live-lock state.</t>
</section>

We don't vote, we operate by rough consensus.

We have rough consensus as a result of IETF#66 and the subsequent
approval of the proceedings to proceed with an informative document.

That means that to overturn that, you need rough consensus in entirely
the opposite direction. Given that there is at least a body of people
interested in completing this document, you seem to have a significant
hurdle to overcome.

hello,

im a newbie. im trying out some stuff with xlite. can anyone tell me
how to implement the doMessage method for instant messaging?

an example code would be very helpful. Im trying to implement it in
the findme example that comes with the weblogic sip server.

thank you in advance.

best regards,
Cal

Hi,

Please remember that UA could figure that out also with rport.
It should work both for UDP and TCP as well.

>by checking the XMA value etc. Again, outbound can be used also in
>no-NAT scenarios, so the UA can use the STUN response information to

Generically STUN does not help for that, since keepalives are also
needed due to firewalls and STUN can not help the UA to detect the
presence of firewall.

In my understanding muxing STUN with SIP seemed as a good idea for
UDP flows. However if the value of UDP flows is rather questionable,
I would claim the same applies also to STUN keepalives, too.

Regards,

Erkki

A UA that wants to determine whether or not a temp-gruu it has for
itself is still valid can do that test any time: send an OPTIONS request
to the domain of the gruu addressed to that temp-gruu.  If you get the
request back, it's still good.  No change is needed to gruu, and no
support for the reg event package is needed by either the UA or the
registrar.

The word "prevents" sounds like it is a feature and a good thing. It's 
more like a side effect. I propose changing that word to "prohibits".

Also, I want to second Markus on his comment. If outbound is supposed 
to work with presence and IM or any event package for that matter, then 
recommending not to use outbound is not a solution.

No, but we do so by breaking SIP rules. Something we want to move away 
from.

Hmm - clearly whatever Scott and I had agreed might work is probably  
irrelevant at this point since it clearly was not something we all  
agreed to or can even remember. It was just an hallway conversation  
between Scott and I. BTW, my vague recollection of it was I thought  
we had agreed that saying the response body would not be included  
unless it was less the total message was less than 1500 octets and  
provide advice on how to trim it down to be that size.

I just checked the latest SIPit report, and it seems that only 5 
implementations supported reg event, as opposed to 29 that supported 
refer, 23 message-summary, or 14 presence.

Well, this probably indicates that reg-event is not widely deployed to 
justify a solution based on it. Therefore, I don't mind Jonathan's 
solution #2

I like this proposal, although I would not use MUST. Either of these is 
optional. Both is recommended.

That matches my recollection regarding the handling of hop limit
responses (and any other similar diagnostic responses), but I didn't
think that was the current question.  

I was referring to a general rule for what to do with _any_ large
response on a path that includes UDP.  My recollection is that there are
essentially three points of view on this:

      * Do Nothing - let UDP either work or not (there seemed to be
        important disagreement on how often this is a problem), and if
        it doesn't work, don't do anything different to make it easier
        to detect why not.

      * Diagnostic Provisional Response - add a small 1xx response or
        responses (as described in
        draft-gurbani-sip-large-udp-response-00) to aid in diagnosis of
        failures.  This ran into objections from some people with
        respect to non-INVITE transactions, and from others who seemed
        to object on broader grounds.

      * Always Return Error - instead of returning whatever final
        response you were going to return (whether positive or
        negative), return an error indicating that the response would be
        too large.

Alas, I think we've only gotten as far as the 'Rough' in 'Rough
Consensus' on this.

Obviously, I prefer some form of Diagnostic Provisional response.  I do
believe this is a significant problem.  I prefer the diagnositc approach
because it allows things to work if the large UDP response actually gets
through, but gives you some hint as to why not when it doesn't.   I
think that the relative cost of the extra 1xx is acceptable when
compared to the cost of the retransmissions when things are broken.

I disagree; that will generally not work.

Many networks deploy stateful firewalls that do connection tracking. They
will not show up as NAT, but will require keepalives. I've seen these
especially in mobile networks, but I would imagine many enterprises deploy
similar stuff.

My experience has been that if you want robust connectivity for your SIP
app, use TCP (you get 30x more performance from middleboxes) and *always*
use keepalives, with their frequency tuned towards the lowest common
keepalive interval found in the field.

Clearly, YMMV.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi Aki,

You are correct regarding firewalls. I was only thinking about NATs.

I disagree; that will generally not work.

Many networks deploy stateful firewalls that do connection tracking. =
They
will not show up as NAT, but will require keepalives. I've seen these
especially in mobile networks, but I would imagine many enterprises =
deploy
similar stuff.

My experience has been that if you want robust connectivity for your SIP
app, use TCP (you get 30x more performance from middleboxes) and =
*always*
use keepalives, with their frequency tuned towards the lowest common
keepalive interval found in the field.

Clearly, YMMV.

Cheers,
Aki

Scott,

Its certainly true that a gruu can always be tested to see if it works. 
That would however raise the question of when one ought to do the test. 
In normal cases you will know the status of your gruu by regular 
methods, so you would have no reason to test it. So you would have to 
test whenever you thought failure might have negative consequences. Some 
of the times when failure might have bad consequences are: when 
responding to an incoming INVITE, and any time during a dialog. I guess 
you could send an OPTIONS and await the response before responding to an 
INVITE, and it might even be masked by alerting, but it seems kind of 
annoying to have to do that. But no matter how often you do it during a 
dialog you still might miss the moment your gruu becomes invalid and the 
other end of the dialog sends you a message. (Extremely unlikely, but 
possible.)

I think the other existing solutions get "pretty close", and OPTIONS 
doesn't significantly improve on that.

Hi all,

The SIPS Guidelines Working Group draft has just been issued.

All the changes agreed to in the mailing list and in San Diego, as well
as  have been=20
incorporated.=20

The process as outlined in San Diego has been followed:

- The document is now an Informational document that clarifies RFC 3261
(as opposed
  to modify it).

- There is a new section 3.1 that attempts to capture the consensus of
the group
  that SIPS is valid within SIP. What happens outside of SIP (e.g.,
  PSTN) is out-of-scope. People can review that section and comment on
it. That was
  the agreement in response to Dean's Point #4.

- There is a new section 3.2 clarifying Best-effort use of TLS (i.e.,
don't use SIPS
  for best-effort just use SIP transported over TLS). That was Dean's
Point #3.

- Section 4.1's title has been changed to make it obvious that SIPS is
hop-by-hop
  and not end-to-end.

- Appendix A has been added to discuss Further Steps in Specification.
This section
  consist of brief discussion of areas that we believe may eventually
require
  further specifications. It is expected that this section will require
beefing-up.
  Please comment on it. It currently list 2 areas:

  - Deprecation of Last Hop Exception, reflecting the agreement from the
San Diego
    meeting. That was Dean's point #2.

  - True end-to-end security.

- Appendix B "To be done": Please have a look at this section. =20

Would a third party observing multiple uses of temp-gruu be able to  
correlate them from this time-stamp and therefore make a reasonable  
deduction that all the temp-gruus were bound to the same Contact and  
therefore used by the same user?

Would we care?

Hi,

I don't see the point in this proposal. If the UA can establish a
flow/connection for a reliable transport (TCP), why would it need the
unreliable transport (UDP) flow in the first place? All traffic could be
sent over TCP anyway.=20

Because some service providers don't want to use TCP.

Hi,

The proposal says that the UA MUST open a reliable transport connection
too. So, the service provider infra would need to support TCP
connections from all UAs using outbound. So, if the service provider or
the proxy vendor would be concerned about the number of TCP connections,
this would not help. But are you saying that the issue would not the
number of connections but the traffic over those connections? Can you
elaborate this?

Spending IETF working group time and efforts on making standards that 
try to cope with people implementing only the bits and pieces they seem 
fit from earlier standards is both irresponsible and stupid.

I know you know that TCP+TLS is mandated for a proxy by RFC3261.

Spoken like a true academic. This has nothing to do with 
implementation, but has a lot to do with deployment. You can implement 
all the MUSTs you want, but you cannot mandate its use, TCP and TCP/TLS 
is one great example of that.

If the IETF does not want to solve real life deployment problems but 
instead wants to solve academic ones, then service providers will start 
deploying proprietary solutions to fit their immediate needs and 
vendors will implement products that no service provider cares for.

Thanks,
Hisham

While I would not necessarily have phrased it as Fredrik did, he is
right.

If you don't want to reflect the previous decisions of the SIP WG that
already exist in published deliverables, then you should be seeking to
change those published deliverables.

For security, the way to do that is by discussing and including
appropriate text in draft-ietf-sip-sips-00. I don't believe I have seen
much Hisham sourced input.

If we don't do this we end up down a compatibility discussions rathole
from which the group will never emerge.

Regards

Keith

After sending I realized that my words were a bit harsh, for which I 
apologize. I guess you mistake the university domain name of mine with 
academic reasoning, but the truth is that I am _not_ interested in SIP 
in an academic way. I'm actually trying to deploy SIP on Stockholm 
university.

Even though I have implemented lots of things (including draft-outbound 
03) my primary concern is deployment, I can assure you. If there is 
anything I need for deployment it is simplicity. Outbound with TCP/TLS 
is a piece of cake - Outbound with UDP clearly is not. It is not TCP/TLS 
that is adding complexity, but UDP. I mentioned in another e-mail that 
my code to deframe SIP messages received over streams were less than 130 
lines of code. My STUN demuxing-responding code for UDP is about the 
double of that.

I'm assuming that you are a provider of SIP service to end users who 
might often be behind NAT. Can you please explain how you see it as the 
most deployable solution to base it all on UDP instead of offering 
TCP/TLS in your service and even advocating the use of UACs that support 
TCP/TLS?

/Fredrik

Hi,

I still fail to see all the "complexity" that UDP adds.

 From the top of my head,

   1) requiring STUN keepalives and de-muxing

   2) much more keepalives (every 29s instead of 120s)

   3) having to do resends yourself (not specific to Outbound)

   4) being insufficient in itself (having limitation of request size),
      therefor not adding any value when you _still_ have to do TCP/TLS
      as well as UDP

The timestamp is only in the response to REGISTER. It isn't embedded in 
the gruu itself and so isn't visible to those receiving the gruu as a 
remote target or whatever.

(There is likely a timestamp *in* the gruu as well (along with the AOR 
and instance id), used to determine its validity. But when using that 
technique to construct temp gruus it will be necessary to encrypt all 
that info so that only the registrar/proxy can extract it.

Can you pinpont exactly the real life deployment problems you mention
with using TCP? Does it have something to do with server-side
scalability?

I personally believe going TCP-only would actually help deployment
rather than hinder it, but I'd be really interested to be convinced
otherwise.

   Because some service providers don't want to use TCP.

Why?  I think adding a little more detail to this statement would
help.  Stated this plainly, my mind appends "... because they are
petulant".

But if service providers are avoiding TCP because there is some
genuine burden associated with using TCP, that must be expressible as
a requirement, one which may well have been overlooked.  So expressing
the requirement in as much detail as possible will help us progress.

Not knowing much about the subject, my guess would be that TCP has
overheads, in that one must keep significant state about each
connection and perhaps send keepalive packets periodically.  But
outbound seems to incorporate those already; I don't see how TCP could
be more burdensome than UDP-with-outbound.

The simplest answer, which we've discussed here previously, is that a  
naive implementation of a proxy using TCP is limited by the number of  
sockets provided by the OS, which is usually something less than the  
number of file handles and tends to be less than 64k. This caps the  
"fan out" of a proxy" at a number smaller than some operators would  
like. Of course, it's possible to write a more sophisticated proxy  
using select/poll that doesn't have this limitation, but only on OS  
that support it.

There's another answer occasionally used that is far less  
supportable: many people in the mobile community have historically  
believed that TCP is less suitable than UDP for mobile networks,  
because the reliability and timing properties of those networks are  
different. These networks also don't use NAT or "outbound" per se,  
and therefore generally do not do keepalives at the IP level. Given  
this, UDP implementations are more air-efficient than naive TCP  
implementations because of TCP keepalive and retransmission. Of  
course, one can make a slightly smarter TCP implementation that does  
very little TCP keepalive, so once again we've learned how to mostly  
overcome this objection.

One other thing that UDP makes easier is fault tolerance across a  
proxy farm with replicated state. Of course, we've also learned how  
to do this with TCP (and even with TLS) at reasonable levels of  
efficiency.

In other words, to the best of my knowledge, the only good reason to  
keep using UDP is because you have it deployed already and don't want  
to change, because change is expensive and disruptive. Of course, if  
one is going to phase in "outbound", one is going to have to make  
similar changes.

We should keep this in mind -- Change isn't mandatory. Neither is  
survival. But if you're unwilling to do the first, you're unlikely to  
achieve the second.

I don't like requiring the registrar to return a timestamp because it's
yet another piece of state that it has to keep for every registration.

I don't think it actually helps all that much - going back to your
original problem statements:

Case 3 can be avoided by just not waiting too long (overlap by a few
minutes instead of a few seconds - if that's still problematic then you
probably have other problems that are worse anyway).

Cases 4,5, and 6 are essentially all the same from the point of view of
the UA; your registration state at the server is lost because of some
event you are not aware of.  This is true of any registration, and is
not specific to temp-gruu or public gruu; it can happen with a Contact
value you provide without gruu at all.  A gruu is slightly worse in that
loosing the state can affect in-dialog requests for established dialogs,
but I think that's just an unavoidable chance that you take when you
choose to use a gruu of either kind.  Put another way, if you use a
gruu, you accept the fact that you're relying on an additional service
for in-dialog connectivity - it's either worth the benefits or it isn't.

Keith,

I don't believe Hisham was objecting here to MUST implement.  I think 
Hisham is objecting to adding a MUST use statement to outbound.

I don't like requiring the registrar to return a timestamp because it's
yet another piece of state that it has to keep for every registration.

I don't think it actually helps all that much - going back to your
original problem statements:

Case 3 can be avoided by just not waiting too long (overlap by a few
minutes instead of a few seconds - if that's still problematic then you
probably have other problems that are worse anyway).

Cases 4,5, and 6 are essentially all the same from the point of view of
the UA; your registration state at the server is lost because of some
event you are not aware of.  This is true of any registration, and is
not specific to temp-gruu or public gruu; it can happen with a Contact
value you provide without gruu at all.  A gruu is slightly worse in that
loosing the state can affect in-dialog requests for established dialogs,
but I think that's just an unavoidable chance that you take when you
choose to use a gruu of either kind.  Put another way, if you use a
gruu, you accept the fact that you're relying on an additional service
for in-dialog connectivity - it's either worth the benefits or it isn't.

Hello,

A NOTIFY request containing watcher XML contains also an Event header
that indicates the event package this NOTIFY relates to. However,
RFC3858 instructs us to add a mandatory "package" parameter to each
watcher list of the watcher XML.=20

Why should there be a "package" parameter in every watcher-list? Why is
the event package of the Event header in the NOTIFY request
insufficient?=20

Thank you,

Tamar Barzuza.

I could ask you the converse. I'd really be interested to be convinced 
how TCP deployment improves scalability.

   In other words, to the best of my knowledge, the only good reason to  
   keep using UDP is because you have it deployed already and don't want  
   to change, because change is expensive and disruptive.

Which is actually a legitimate requirement, if the amount of
money/trouble is economically significant in an industry.

   Of course, if one is going to phase in "outbound", one is going to
   have to make similar changes.

It seems to me that that is the bottom line -- installing
UDP-with-outbound-keepalives is going to be nearly as much work as
installing TCP, so better to use TCP, which has better long-term
prospects.

I would, however, like to hear an analysis from someone who is
forseeing trouble from TCP.

Dale,

Besides scalability issues, there are no technical issues. The issues 
are with having to throw all the infrastructure we currently have out 
of the window and start all over again. Having 110k+ customers live 
does not make is an easy and justifiable task.

Why do we prefer to run away from the problem and ignore it pretending 
it does not "really" exist instead of trying to fix it?

To name two things where TCP would provide better scalability than UDP 
for a SIP service provider :

   1) Say that your services maximum capacity for non-INVITEs is 1000
      requests per second. If you get 2000 in a single second, you won't
      only have to deal with all those 2000 requests, but also with quite
      a few retransmissions sent after 500ms. With TCP, the wall isn't as
      dense.

   2) UDP sockets have a shared receive buffer, most commonly around 64k
      I believe (even though the maximum seems to be 256k on FreeBSD at
      least). With SIP messages of perhaps 700 bytes on average, you
      have to be able to move messages out of that buffer pretty fast to
      keep it from filling up. A full buffer means dropped packets. I've
      also heard that on for example Linux, every packet actually
      occupies an even 2k (or was it 4k) in the buffer, so 64k buffer is
      actually at most 32 packets at a time.

And then there are of course other aspects than scalability where UDP is 
an inferior solution, most notably security related things like for 
example spoofed CANCELs (which can't be challenged, RFC3261 #22.1).

To paraphrase, it seems that you think we have enough mechanism now, and 
don't need any more to deal with the issues raised in this thread. Is 
that right?

Let's go back to the original topic - what should the draft say about the 
transport protocol in relationship with outbound

The major use case for outbound is UAs behind NAT / firewalls. Many of such 
devices have known issues with UDP fragmentation, so for many environments 
TCP will need to be used for messages larger than the path MTU (often ~1460 
bytes in ethernet environments, RFC3261 puts the limit at 1300).

If you start from the requirement "MUST only use UDP", then there is little 
room for constructive discussions. For UDP-only to work you will need to 
ensure that messages either stay below path MTUs, or disallow NAT. This 
implies significant limitations for your deployment environment. In any 
case, this is not a setup that outbound should focus on.

In the general case, there are environments that have to deal with NAT and 
messages larger than path MTU. This is what outbound was written for. This 
also implies a UA that supports TCP. Given that the UA supports TCP and the 
fact that presence of devices like stateful firewalls cannot reliably be 
detected, the UA SHOULD use TCP (or another connection oriented transport). 
If in addition the UA supports TLS, it SHOULD use TLS.

I think this is sufficient

Jeroen

Yes, agreed. This is a real concern, but also a problem that

Not to mention the differences in transaction timers. For UDP transaction 
state (in particular non-INVITE server transactions) is retained much longer 
than for TCP. For the proxy-2-proxy case (i.e. small fan-in, few rx 
buffers ) TCP is often a better choice than UDP, especially when memory is 
your bottleneck.

Drawbacks for TCP are message boundary detection overhead and some byte 
copying overhead, which add some delay and some CPU load (though probably 
insignificant). Implementation complexity is slightly higher for TCP too.

Though interesting, IMHO all of this is not so relevant for the outbound 
discussion. Proxies must already implement TCP, the UA is better of using 
TCP if it can.

Jeroen

Thanks for bringning back the original topic.

It seems to me that we do not have any evidence that when Outbound
keep-alive is
used because of the presence of a NAT, that there are any advantage to
using
UDP instead of TCP. It seems that all the perceived advantages of UDP
versus TCP
vanish in the presence of a NAT (in fact some have argued that TCP will
actually
scale better). Worst, all the evidence is that UDP will have=20
problems with fragmentation and that it will therefore not be suitable.

Futhermore, if the most important use case for outbound keep-alive is
TCP=20
and not UDP, "optimizing" the solution for UDP is not a good idea. I'd
rather
we have a solution optimized for TCP (and TLS). If we have a solution
for UDP or
not is of little interest to me: I just don't think it will be very
popular and it
will be just one more useless feature to implement.

Nit-pick: the other major use case for outbound is TLS support, but that
does
not require the keepalive. So what you really meant in the second
paragraph is
"The major use case for outbound keep-alive is ...".

I just submitted a new version of this I-D.  Until it appears in the
archives, a copy can be found here:

http://marc.petit-huguenin.org/draft-petithuguenin-sip-fragmentation-responses-01.txt

The new version was rewritten to be more readable and an example was
added.  This version also solves a problem when multiple hops would
trigger response fragmentation.

I am interested in any comments or questions on this I-D, and especially
to hear if people are interested in this work.

Thanks.

That's easy. Imagine that the Internet is a set of sewer pipes, down  
which someone periodically flushes whole cantaloupe. The cantaloupe  
have the side effect of blocking up other drains, causing "back up"  
problems in other people's plumbing fictures.

UDP fragmentation of large responses (or large messages, if one is so  
tacky as to send them that way) will cause bursts of non-flow- 
controlled traffic to be inserted into the network. This clogs up  
buffers, reduces efficient network flow, and generally makes SIP a  
bad network neighbor -- much like the moron upstairs who flushes the  
cantaloupe.

TCP reduces the congestion impact of large messages substantially.  
The net effect is like running the whole cantaloupe through a  
blender, flushing it a cup at a time, and not flushing the next cup  
until you've asked everyone in the building to make sure their  
plumbing is working.

Sure, we could re-invent all of the TCP flow-control using UDP, but  
why bother? We'd eventually just have TCP again.

Factor in the detail that we're well on the way towards having the  
average message large enough to throw at least one fragment (and  
possibly 3 or 4, especially on smaller MTU networks), and I think TCP- 
only SIP starts to become very attractive.

Hello,

I have encountered one unclarity in usage of SigComp as specified by RFC =
3486. In section "4. Sending a Request to a Server" there is said that =
if client wants to receive subsequent requests with compression then =
"this client SHOULD add the parameter comp=3Dsigcomp to the URI in the =
Contact header field". Later in the specification there are examples =
that are in conflict with this statement.

(1) INVITE UAS
    Via: UAC;comp=3Dsigcomp
    Route: P1;comp=3Dsigcomp
    Contact: UAC;comp=3Dsigcomp

The contact header adds the comp parameter, but not as the URI parameter =
but as the header parameter.

I have found another example in 3GPP TS 24.141 v7.2.0 where on page 24 =
there is the Contact header in the form

Contact: <sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]:1357;comp=3Dsigcomp>

This header has no header parameter and its value is sip uri with =
parameter. Later in that document, there is SIP NOTIFY message where the =
SIP URI from the Contact header is used in Request-URI in exactly the =
same format.

I have got few questions:
1. Where shall be the comp parameter used - as uri parameter or as =
header parameter?
2. If it is uri parameter, are the examples in RFC 3486 invalid?
3. If it is header parameter, then if client issues comp parameter as =
uri parameter does it mean that it is willing to receive compressed =
content?

br, Martin Hynar

Martin,

The text above the example in RFC3486 explicitly says "We have not used a 
correct format for these header fields."

comp=sigcomp is a URI parameter, not a header parameter

Jeroen

My two cents:  it's all about re-transmissions and security.  Would be curi=
ous to hear deployment experience around DTLS and whether or not that has a=
ctually helped the security of UDP deployments.

To name two things where TCP would provide better scalability than UDP
for a SIP service provider :

   1) Say that your services maximum capacity for non-INVITEs is 1000
      requests per second. If you get 2000 in a single second, you won't
      only have to deal with all those 2000 requests, but also with quite
      a few retransmissions sent after 500ms. With TCP, the wall isn't as
      dense.

   2) UDP sockets have a shared receive buffer, most commonly around 64k
      I believe (even though the maximum seems to be 256k on FreeBSD at
      least). With SIP messages of perhaps 700 bytes on average, you
      have to be able to move messages out of that buffer pretty fast to
      keep it from filling up. A full buffer means dropped packets. I've
      also heard that on for example Linux, every packet actually
      occupies an even 2k (or was it 4k) in the buffer, so 64k buffer is
      actually at most 32 packets at a time.

And then there are of course other aspects than scalability where UDP is
an inferior solution, most notably security related things like for
example spoofed CANCELs (which can't be challenged, RFC3261 #22.1).

   Besides scalability issues, there are no technical issues.

Naively, the scaling of UDP-with-outbound doesn't seem to be any
better than TCP-with-outbound.  Can you elucidate the scalability
issues that are causing you problems?

   The issues are with having to throw all the infrastructure we
   currently have out of the window and start all over again. Having
   110k+ customers live does not make is an easy and justifiable task.

Naively, to implement outbound will require changing the software in
the proxies and UAs, regardless of whether it uses UDP or TCP.  I
suppose this can be called "throwing infrastructure out of the
window", but it seems to be a routine matter.  Can you elucidate why
UDP-with-outbound reduces this burden compared to implementing
TCP-with-outbound?

   Why do we prefer to run away from the problem and ignore it
   pretending it does not "really" exist instead of trying to fix it?

Can you elucidate what "the problem" is that you are referring to?

Dale

I followed a little bit the discussion about the usage of UDP and TCP
with Outbound, and my opinion is that both UDP and TCP need to be supported.

Obviously UDP alone cannot be used with Outbound because if there is a
potential fragmentation in a request sent to the UA or in a response
sent from the UA, there is no way to switch to a congestion controlled
transport.

So we (Packet8) did some tests by comparing UDP and TCP, and we found
that, even by using advanced coding techniques, UDP uses less resources
than TCP.

So we tried a combination of temporary TCP and UDP.  The idea is that
TCP is really needed only for few types of transactions on a real life
endpoint.  One of this transactions is an INVITE, because the size added
by the SDP, especially when carrying ICE attributes and audio+video+text
sessions, nearly always results in a packet size that is over the MTU.
Another case is the full state NOTIFY for the reg-event that is to be
received after sending a SUBSCRIBE (partial state NOTIFY are OK).
REGISTER, even fully loaded with extensions are generally OK.

We retried our tests and found that using temporary TCP for the INVITE
and full state NOTIFY transaction with UDP for all the other
transactions was using more ressources than UDP alone, but still less
than using only TCP.

So I wrote this I-D that describe a solution to implement this mixed
UDP/TCP as an extension to Outbound.  This is really a first draft, as
there is a lot missing (e.g. how an edge proxy knows that the UA
supports this, etc...), but I wanted to know if there is interest in
working on this direction.

Until the draft appears in the archives, a copy can be found here:

Questions and comments are welcome.

Thanks.

I find this whole conversation way off base. If people would like to  
deprecate UDP, go work on a document to explain that and feel free to  
bring it to the WG. In the mean time, SIP is specified over both UDP  
and TCP. Most deployments only use UDP, some only use TCP, and I  
suspect there are some that do both but I am not aware of them.  
Outbound as it is seems very consistent with 3261 in that it allows a  
system to use TCP or UDP. Keeping this in mind few comments inline ....

These known issues with fragmentation might be less common than you  
think however, outbound does not have anything to do with MTU issues.  
It does not try and solve them and it does not make them worse.

MTU is a problem regardless of NATs or Firewalls. Fragmented packets  
do manager to traverse most NATs and Firewalls.

Again, this topic is not really about outbound. If you think a 3261  
UA that supports both UDP and TCP SHOULD use TCP, that is a fine  
argument to go make in the discussion about use of TCP and UDP but it  
seems to be an independent choice from anything to do with outbound.

Maybe I'm missing something in this keep-alive and UDP/TCP debate.

I find the obsession with performance out of place.

All the evidence that I've seen is that in a commercial product, that
the server is=20
really not spending much of it's cycles doing keep-alives. The evidence
is also that
if you are doing keep-alives, the transport will matter even less.

We keep going back to the same issues, with the same conclusions
regarding
performance: the keep-alive mechanism doesn't really matter, and the
transport=20
doesn't matter either.

Yet somehow, we keep agonising over this. In the real world, people
keep on using PING/OPTIONS/short-lived-REGISTER/CRLF/STUN and whatever.

Let's pick something and move on.

   I don't think this is naive at all. I think you hit the nail on the
   head very sqarely.

Well, I know I'm not up-to-date on all these issues.  I suspect that
Hisham knows of certain problems that I don't, but we need more
information about them to be able to discuss the situation usefully.

Performance is important at least for service providers, because they
have to buy the hardware to run the servers, pay the licenses per CPU,
pay the datacenters cost, pay the sysadmins to run the servers and pay
the managers to manage the sysadmins.

So yes, performance is important, but perhaps not for the hardware
vendors, the software vendors and the sysadmins.

To be more specific, SIP is currently specified so it can use UDP for 
requests smaller than 1300 bytes.  It is specified so it can use TCP 
for requests of any size.

Some people have suggested that user agents SHOULD be able to send and 
receive requests larger than 1300 bytes when using the outbound 
mechanism.  This seems like a logical requirement.  Are you objecting 
to this requirement Cullen?

For the sake of this discussion, lets assume that we have consensus on 
this requirement.  What are the implications?  Well, most UAs 
implementing outbound are doing so because they are behind a NAT or a 
firewall and will not be able to receive inbound TCP flows.  These UAs 
will need to establish a TCP flow if they want to meet this requirement 
of receiving requests larger than 1300 bytes. The logical normative 
statement is to say a UA which cannot (or suspects that it cannot) 
receive an inbound TCP flow from its outbound proxies SHOULD open at 
least one TCP or TLS flow to a server in its outbound-proxy-set.

A few people on this mailing list have suggested that for any user 
agent that actually bothers to open a TCP flow, there is no reason 
whatsoever to open a corresponding UDP flow. I wholeheartedly agree 
with them.

The problem is that this thread strikes right at the heart of our 
community's dilemma. We have a large body of people who have deployed 
UDP almost exclusively and effectively ignore the MUST use (and several 
even ignore the MUST implement) TCP statements in our core spec.  
Ironically, one of the problems which prevents realistic interoperable 
deployment of TCP-based SIP implementations is the lack of a 
standardized mechanism for doing outbound.  [Dean also identified some 
other problems often faced when deploying TCP with programs that use 
"obvious" (Dean actually said "naive") textbook implementation 
techniques.]

I think that a large number of the core spec contributors and seasoned 
implementors now recognize that there are many non-academic problems 
with SIP over UDP and that some day we will want to either deprecate or 
at least seriously curtail the use of UDP.  Like a very heavy drinker 
we know it will be good for us to kick the habit.  We are not quitting 
today. The question before us is are we going to do something in 
outbound that makes it harder for us to quit in the future.

My concrete proposal is the following:
- make CRLF the only keepalive mechanism for TCP and TLS over TCP flow 
(retain STUN for UDP flows)
- make outbound registrations over UDP flows optional for UAs
- include the statement that its is RECOMMENDED that the 
outbound-proxy-set is configured to result in registrations over TCP or 
TLS whenever the UA can't accept incoming TCP flows (the 3GPP 
exception).  explain that for historical purposes a lot of deployments 
still only use UDP, but that we expect/hope those deployments to 
eventually migrate to TCP when doing outbound.

What's in it for the TCP crowd?  They get to implement outbound with no 
UDP if they so desire.  They don't have to implement STUN over TCP. The 
draft clearly explains why TCP is the technically preferred solution.

What's in it for the UDP crowd? They get outbound behavior (at least 
for requests <1300 bytes) specified in the core draft for UDP.  They 
can keep doing what they are doing, but with STUN keepalives if the UA 
and edge proxy both support it.

What's not to like?

I like this proposal. It makes it very attractive to implement outbound for
TCP, whilst still having the possibility of doing UDP if you really want to.
Don't forget that one of the use cases for outbound is TLS, where there is
no certificate deployed at the UA. For this case, outbound is needed
regardless of the presence of NAT/firewall. Having to do STUN keep-alive for
this case just because it is needed for the UDP NAT/firewall case is rather
burdensome.

That's not what I said. I said using TCP helps *deployment*, namely
gives more robust NAT/FW traversal, enables security and just generally
reduces complexity (e.g., makes transport-switching unnecessary).

My thesis here is that going TCP-only makes deployment easier without
incurring any noticeable performance penalty regarding server-side
scalability. And we've done some experiments that show this to be
accurate.

Cheers,
Aki

Let me also chime in here a bit. 

We've done experiments on Linux using a proxy server built on top of our
sofia-sip stack, and have noticed no significant slowdown on an ordinary
desktop PC handling 100s of thousands of registrations simultaneously using
TCP. The stack's Linux implementation uses epoll, which is even more
efficient than select() or poll(). Now, this is not very portable, although
other OSs have similar schemes, like kqueue in BSD. 

Also, if one wanted to write their proxy in Python, the numbers would
probably look a lot different; then again high performance probably isn't
what one is looking for with Python in the first place. Similarly, the
performance of a proxy can suck due to numerous other reasons as well, e.g.,
a frequent dip in a hugely expensive database or RPC backend. We didn't
really touch up on those issues in our experiments, but I suspect many of
these other issues have fairly easy (and expensive) solutions to them. :)

So once and for all, I'd really like to bust the myth, break the urban
legend, and stop the folklore that using TCP wrecks proxy performance. On
modern OSs it really *does not*.

Cheers,
Aki

If any of you have your SIP WG chair in your address books, as opposed
to using the alias provided by IETF, please note that my email address
has changed to that shown below.

While the old address will continue to work until end February, now
would be a good time to update your address books.

The IETF web pages and email lists are now all showing/using the new
address.

Isn't that an implementation issue?

What if a client "knows" that it will never send or receive requests
larger than 1300 bytes?

I think it's quite clear that a client located behdind a NAT/Firewall,
wanting to be able to receive inbound TCP flows, should take actions to
allow that. But, do we need to say more than that?

That's probably true. But, again, is that something we need to specify,
or is it an implementation issue?

First people wanted to use outbound to "promote" STUN, now to get rid of
UDP. Is that really what we are supposed to be doing?

I still fail to see what the technical problems with outbound and STUN
is. It may be more complex than TCP, but are there really any open
issues to be solved?

I don't understand why a standards spec shall talk about what we hope
and expect... As Cullen said, UDP is a valid transport protocol for SIP,
so I don't understand why we need to "justify" anything...

Just to clarify: the edge proxy is still required to implement STUN, in
case someone establishes UDP flows with it, right?

You can actually hide all of this behind canonical APIs by using
libevent (http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/).  Your code is
extremely portable then, unless of course, your target is a
RTOS system of some sort where libevent is not compilable (and I
know a couple of the RTOS where this is the case).

Maybe this thread should now migrate to sip-implementors ;-)

No, it is an interoperability issue which is consistent with our core 
spec.

For most UAs the client will never be able to "know" that.  In fact 
most UAs will be reasonably sure that they WILL be getting requests 
larger than this size.  The only reason this is not a MUST is that we 
have some environments (like 3GPP) that are trying hard to keep 
requests under MTU size and where requests larger than this size are 
rare.

For most UAs we do.  Therefore a SHOULD is appropriate.

We have normative language in our specifications that recommend all 
sorts of things that are far less important and significant than this.

No, we already have several good reasons to get rid of UDP in the 
future.  What I am proposing is that we don't make it harder for us to 
do so when the time comes.

If we have a SHOULD, we need to justify why someone might not do the 
SHOULD.  In some ways the bar is even higher here since we are 
justifying why this wasn't a MUST.

That would be part of my plan.

And the minute that they interconnect to something that hasn't been
trying, the assumption gets blown clean out of the water, right? That
is the nature of an internet, right? I guess I don't see the point of
special casing something for the range of the moment. It seems like
the SHOULD isn't really a SHOULD at all because we know that
those assumptions will eventually bite because the SIP wg sure isn't
putting any energy in making that true for the Internet at large.

Dear chairs,

Rohan has always disagreed with our TCP keep alive mechanism. He has  
brought this up over many meetings. IT has been discussed many times  
and we have taken WG hums on it. This whole argument that he is  
creating is centered around trying to kill the way TCP keep alive are  
done. He is not alone, others agree with him. The basic argument  
against it is it is a pain to implement - I've implemented and did  
not find it a big deal but agree it is more complicated that  
implementing the Double CRLF approach. We did have reasonable good  
consensus for it in the last WG hum we took on it.

I would like the chairs to make a statement about if they want reopen  
the issue of how to do TCP Keep alives. If yes, I'm glad to present  
on it at next IETF, if not, I want to know that I can just ignore it.

Agree with above. Note that you said SIP specified a way to do this  
not that deployments must use this.

yes - I object to this. I think the specification should specify how  
things work for large requests but that an UA should be allowed to  
choose to use only UDP if it wants to accept the limitations that  
this implies.

Again, I don't see why you are trying to tie up deprecating UDP with  
the outbound draft.

Agree with above. Note that you said SIP specified a way to do this  
not that deployments must use this.

yes - I object to this. I think the specification should specify how  
things work for large requests but that an UA should be allowed to  
choose to use only UDP if it wants to accept the limitations that  
this implies.

Again, I don't see why you are trying to tie up deprecating UDP with  
the outbound draft.

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

Hi,

- The argument for using STUN over TCP was "for consistency with UDP".
 However the code necessary to demux STUN and SIP over TCP is pretty
much orthogonal to the code to demux STUN and SIP over UDP.
- In addition to being simpler, CRLF over TCP is backwards compatible
with RFC 3261 implementations.

I believe the WG made the decision it did based on the erroneous
assumption that STUN over TCP would be easier since implementations
would have to implement STUN for UDP anyway.  I would like to reopen
this decision because I believe it was based on faulty data.  In
addition, if we allow UAs to only implement outbound over TCP, this
woudl be yet another assumption that would no longer hold true.

thanks,
-rohan

Hi Cullen,

Please read the following definition carefully and then tell me why
you think my proposed statement ("user agents SHOULD be able to send
and receive requests larger than 1300 bytes when using the outbound
mechanism") is inappropriate.

>From RFC 2119:
>3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
>   may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
>   particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
>   carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

thanks,
-rohan

hum. This is not about deprecating UDP, it's about avoiding unnecessary 
complexity for TCP (and TLS)

Dear all SIP experts,

 

Related with the usage of this multiple connections in SDP, I'd like to get
a clarification from all your SIP experts. 

The IETF RFC 4317 provides some examples for multiple connection lines (i.e.
'c=') in SDP offer and SDP answer. 

Even though IETF RFC 4566 (SDP), there is no clear definition of the usage
of multiple connection lines in SDP. Can it be expected that all SIP UA
support media transmission to/from multiple IP addresses in a single
session. i.e. Can supporting multiple connection('c=') lines be regarded as
a basic capability of the SIP UA?

 

Best Regards,

Eanny Bae

Dear Attila Sipos, 

Thanks for quick answer. 
>From your kindly explanation, I got to clarify that all SIP UA can support
SDP including multiple media description having a different connection
('c=') value per media type. Furthermore, I believe this capability is a
basic capability of SIP UA.

Eanny Bae

Subject: RE: [Sip] The support of multiple connection line 'c=' in SIP UA.

RFC 4566 says...
 
5.7.  Connection Data ("c=")

      c=<nettype> <addrtype> <connection-address>

   The "c=" field contains connection data.

   A session description MUST contain either at least one "c=" field in
   each media description or a single "c=" field at the session level.
   It MAY contain a single session-level "c=" field and additional "c="
   field(s) per media description, in which case the per-media values
   override the session-level settings for the respective media.

The "session description" above  is the bit before any m= lines.
The "media descriptions" start with an m= line.
So an SDP has 1 session description section and can have
multiple media descriptions.
 
so as examples or positioning of c= lines, you can have:
 
1. There is one c= line at the session description
    Each media description uses the connection information from
    that top c= line.
c=....                     // session description
m=....                    // 1st media description
a=..... 
m=....                    // 2nd media description
a=.....
 
or
 
 
2. Each media description has its own c= line
    (There is no session description c= line):
 
 
                                // session description (no c= line)
m=....                    // 1st media description
c=....
a=..... 
m=....                    // 2nd media description
c=....
a=.....
 
 
or
 
3. There is a session description c= line but the first
    media description has its own c= line , so the first
    media description's c= line overrides the session description c= line.
   The 2nd media description uses the c= line in the session description.
c=....                    // session description
m=....                    // 1st media description
c=....
a=..... 
m=....                    // 2nd media description
a=.....
 
 
Regards,
Attila

UA. 
	
	

	Dear all SIP experts,

	 

	Related with the usage of this multiple connections in SDP, I'd like
to get a clarification from all your SIP experts. 

	The IETF RFC 4317 provides some examples for multiple connection
lines (i.e. 'c=') in SDP offer and SDP answer. 

	Even though IETF RFC 4566 (SDP), there is no clear definition of the
usage of multiple connection lines in SDP. Can it be expected that all SIP
UA support media transmission to/from multiple IP addresses in a single
session. i.e. Can supporting multiple connection('c=') lines be regarded as
a basic capability of the SIP UA?

	Eanny Bae

By the way, for interop, most UA's like the style in
example 1.  I have found some UA's that don't like
example 2 where there is no c=3D line in the session description.

(I have not actually tried example 3 with any UA)

Regards,
Attila

Dear Attila Sipos,=20

Thanks for quick answer.=20
>From your kindly explanation, I got to clarify that all SIP UA can =

SDP including multiple media description having a different connection

a

Subject: RE: [Sip] The support of multiple connection line 'c=3D' in SIP =
UA.

RFC 4566 says...
=20
5.7.  Connection Data ("c=3D")

      c=3D<nettype> <addrtype> <connection-address>

   The "c=3D" field contains connection data.

   A session description MUST contain either at least one "c=3D" field =
in
   each media description or a single "c=3D" field at the session level.
   It MAY contain a single session-level "c=3D" field and additional =
"c=3D"
   field(s) per media description, in which case the per-media values
   override the session-level settings for the respective media.

The "session description" above  is the bit before any m=3D lines.
The "media descriptions" start with an m=3D line.
So an SDP has 1 session description section and can have
multiple media descriptions.
=20
so as examples or positioning of c=3D lines, you can have:
=20
1. There is one c=3D line at the session description
    Each media description uses the connection information from
    that top c=3D line.
c=3D....                     // session description
m=3D....                    // 1st media description
a=3D.....=20
m=3D....                    // 2nd media description
a=3D.....
=20
or
=20
=20
2. Each media description has its own c=3D line
    (There is no session description c=3D line):
=20
=20
                                // session description (no c=3D line)
m=3D....                    // 1st media description
c=3D....
a=3D.....=20
m=3D....                    // 2nd media description
c=3D....
a=3D.....
=20
=20
or
=20
3. There is a session description c=3D line but the first
    media description has its own c=3D line , so the first
    media description's c=3D line overrides the session description c=3D =
line.
   The 2nd media description uses the c=3D line in the session =
description.
c=3D....                    // session description
m=3D....                    // 1st media description
c=3D....
a=3D.....=20
m=3D....                    // 2nd media description

	Dear all SIP experts,

	=20

	Related with the usage of this multiple connections in SDP, I'd like
to get a clarification from all your SIP experts.=20

	The IETF RFC 4317 provides some examples for multiple connection
lines (i.e. 'c=3D') in SDP offer and SDP answer.=20

	Even though IETF RFC 4566 (SDP), there is no clear definition of the
usage of multiple connection lines in SDP. Can it be expected that all =
SIP
UA support media transmission to/from multiple IP addresses in a single
session. i.e. Can supporting multiple connection('c=3D') lines be =
regarded as
a basic capability of the SIP UA?

Hello, 

I know that SIP can carry signalling information and media information. Is it possible to make SIP to carry information related to configuration of the end devices or any other information that user wants to exchange. 

Thanks in advance 

with regards 
Raj.

Please, lets not wait until March to discuss this. We can take a hum 
here on the mailing list. My vote for TCP keepalive is CRLF.

Hi,

A couple of questions:

1. What was the reason(s) the CRLF solution is not suitable for UDP?

2. Even for UDP it can be possible to use lower layer keep-alive
mechanisms, e.g. when UDP encapsulated IPSec, is used, so I think one
should be allowed to use that instead of STUN.=20

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

Well in this case, the compression they are using still makes it rare 
to receive > 1300 byte requests over the last hop even when they get 
requests from something in the public Internet that is substantially 
larger. Even over TCP it is still acceptable for a proxy or UA to 
reject a request that is too big.

thanks,
-rohan

You can't detect that a NAT has rebooted and your binding has changed 
over UDP unless your message contains the reflected address.

There is not MUST USE for keepalive=stun, so I think this is tacitly 
permitted anyway.

I agree with Attila. But I'm not sure from your comments if you are 
understanding fully, so let me try again.

An SDP can have one or more media descriptions, each beginning with an 
m= line. (Actually it can have zero media descriptions, but that isn't 
very interesting.)

Each media description needs connection data. If there is more than one 
media description, then the connection data for each may be different, 
or multiple media descriptions may have the same connection data.

If there is a c= line following an m= line, and before another m= line, 
then that provides the connection data for that media description. If 
there is no c= line following the m= line, then the media description 
uses the c= line from the session description - the one before the first 
m= line.

It is legal, for each media description to contain its own c= line, and 
for there also to be a c= line in the session description, even though 
in that case the one in the session description serves no purpose.

A UA must be prepared to receive SDP formatted in any of these ways.

P.S. If you ever intend using INFO for any application, I suggest you =
test the water with an internet-draft on the subject before doing so. =
Many proposed INFO usages are regarded as inappropriate to SIP.

We had most of a room hum the other direction so, which did leave me  
thinking, assuming we don't get a single no on the the list, how many  
yes do think the chairs should be looking for to overturn this? I  
don't really want to know the answer to this as this is something  
that only the chairs need to figure out but it is an interesting  
question to think about when thinking about reopening this.

And just so people understand my position on this, if we reopen this  
issue, I will be voting for whichever path I think can get the draft  
to the IESG the soonest. I've implemented both and they are both  
trivial to implement. I really believe that what we need is to stop  
delaying this draft.

I can understand the argument that what keep alive we use in TCP is  
about avoiding unnecessary complexity for TCP and I'm fine with  
discussing that (thus my email to the chairs) however, Rohan's  
proposal contained other things that are separate issues. And how  
keep-alives work is very relevant to this draft. What protocols  
operators choose to use is an issue orthogonal to this draft (and a  
very complicated issue).

I was thinking, wow, we won't really repeat the exact same  
conversation over again. But then I read the thread below and  
realized that I can not imagine this conversation going any  
differently than the last several times we have done it.

	This looks sensible to me. But, I would like clarification on one  
point; are you proposing that server implementations of outbound  
(registrar, edge proxy) must (still) support outbound over UDP? Or  
would it be optional for these elements as well?

Best regards,
Byron Campen

Cullen,

My best guest on why this is happening is that people used to be
thinking more
about UDP than TCP and consequently expressed a preference for the STUN
approach.

It seems now that more people are paying attention to TCP because of a
bunch of issues
with UDP (including fragmentation, and TLS usage catching up since it
took us so long
to finalize this document). Many are reaching the conclusion that=20
the CRLF approach makes more sense for TCP.

It seems that Rohan's last proposal of using CRLF for TCP, and STUN for
UDP to be
reasonable and logical. And it seems to have lots of support on the
list.

As a chair, I'd be looking for "Yes" statements from a significant  
number of the implementors and folks who supported the STUN/TCP  
position in the previous hums. Continued calls for a revote that seem  
to have support only from the minority that supported CR/LF for TCP  
the first time around represent intransigence, not a change in  
working group position.

But hey, I'll Ask . . .

Previously we had recorded consensus to use STUN for keepalive with  
both TCP and UDP. This was not a perfect consensus (there were some  
dissenters). There has been ongoing discussion notably instigated by  
the current editor of the Outbound draft, that some people feel may  
have resulted in a change of the consensus on this draft's technical  
direction.

So I'd like to ask people who care and think they understand the  
differences to answer the following questions, on-list and on-the  
record.


Proposal 1: Make CRLF the only keepalive mechanism for TCP and TLS  
over TCP flow (retain STUN for UDP flows).

Yes (accept the proposal and use CRLF for TCP) or No (reject the  
proposal and keep STUN for TCP)


Proposal 2: Make outbound registrations over UDP flows optional for UAs.

Yes (Accept the proposal) or No (Reject the proposal).


Proposal 3: Include (in Outbound) the statement that its is  
RECOMMENDED that the outbound-proxy-set is configured to result in  
registrations over TCP or TLS whenever the UA can't accept incoming  
TCP flows. Further, include text that explain that for historical  
purposes a lot of deployments still only use UDP, but that we expect/ 
hope those deployments to eventually migrate to TCP when doing outbound.

Yes (Accept the proposal and add the text) or No (Reject the proposal  
and keep the text as-is).

   Well in this case, the compression they are using still makes it rare 
   to receive > 1300 byte requests over the last hop even when they get 
   requests from something in the public Internet that is substantially 
   larger. Even over TCP it is still acceptable for a proxy or UA to 
   reject a request that is too big.

I suppose it's possible, but it seems to be strongly discouraged.  RFC
3261 says that an implementation must be willing to accept 64k-1 byte
UDP requests:

   18.1.1.  However, implementations MUST be able to handle messages
   up to the maximum datagram packet size.  For UDP, this size is
   65,535 bytes, including IP and UDP headers.

Edge Proxies and Registrars would still need to support outbound with 
UDP.

Yes on all accounts

For (3) (TCP/TLS) I think we will need to say more to support the transition 
path. Currently many UAs dont support TLS, does that mean the outbound set 
should have both SIP and SIPS URIs, and the UA gets to pick?

Hi all!

I've submitted an event package i-d 
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-urpalainen-sip-xcap-diff-event-00.txt> 
about syncing xcap resources with xcap-diff format. The event package 
part is pretty much similar what Jonathan had in xcap-package before it 
was "moved" into the config-framework. The biggest difference is 
probably an OMA requirement to have subscriptions to XCAP components 
also. Any comments ?
thanks, Jari

Hi,

Strong yes to all those three proposals. Please see the
details of my reasons below, I believe they are important
for the your consideration.


In IETF#65 meeting I was one of those who voted for STUN
as keepalive mechanism over TCP. I did that due to consistency
reason: as STUN was selected as a keepalive mechanism instead
of SIP PING for UDP, it appeared to me that using STUN over TCP
as well would be the most straightforward way to go. However I
have changed my opinion due to the following pieces of normative
text which have been added to Outbound draft AFTER the Dallas hum:

1. Usage of UDP flows now appear as a bad idea in general,
   thus my original "consistency reason" has lost its value.
   UA could just set up TCP flows with CRLF keepalives and
   NEVER use STUN for keepalives related to Outbound:

   Use of outbound with UDP flows typically prevents messages larger
   than 1300 bytes from being delivered using TCP as described in
   Section 18.1.1 RFC 3261.  Use of outbound in conjunction with UDP
   flows in environments where requests are expected to be larger than
   this size is therefore NOT RECOMMENDED.

2. Mechanisms to for the UA to validate if the proxy supports=20
   STUN or not appear more complex than hoped. Using OPTIONS for
   the check also consumes an extra round-trip. No such validation
   is needed for CRLF keepalives, which are totally RFC3261 compatible:

   Because sending and receiving binary STUN data on the same ports used
   for SIP is a significant and non-backwards compatible change to RFC
   3261, this section requires a number of checks before sending STUN
   messages to a SIP node.  If a SIP node sends STUN requests (for
   example due to misconfiguration) despite these warnings, the node
   could be blacklisted for UDP traffic, or cause its TCP server to
   loose framing over its connection.  For each target node (as
   determined by IP address, address family, and port number), the
   sender needs to determine if that destination is validated to support
   STUN, that it does not support STUN, or that it needs to be
   validated.

   A SIP node MUST NOT send STUN requests over a flow unless it has an
   explicit indication that the target next hop SIP server claims to
   support STUN.  For example, automatic or manual configuration of an
   outbound-proxy-set which contains the keepalive=3Dstun parameter is
   considered sufficient explicit indication.  Note that UACs MUST NOT
   use an ambiguous configuration option such as "Work through NATs?" or
   "Do Keepalives?" to imply next hop STUN support.  A SIP node MAY also
   probe the next hop using a SIP OPTIONS request to check for support
   of the 'sip-stun' option tag in a Supported header field.

3. If the UA does not support TCP keepalive and the proxy appears not
   to support STUN, then no keepalive over TCP is possible ! If UA could
   simply send CRLF keepalives this would NOT be a problem:

   Futhermore, even with explicit indication of next hop STUN support, a
   SIP node needs to validate support for STUN the first time it sends
   traffic to a specific unvalidated target destination.  If an explicit
   probe indicates support for the 'sip-stun' option-tag, that
   destination is validated for STUN support. If an explicit probe does
   not indicate support for the 'sip-stun' option-tag, the target
   destination does not support STUN request, and the UAC MUST NOT send
   further STUN requests to this destination.  A SIP node MAY send one
   STUN request and its retransmissions to an unvalidated destination.
   If a STUN request ever succeeds to a destination, that destination is
   thereafter validated for STUN support.  If this initial STUN request
   does not result in a STUN response, the SIP node MUST NOT send
   additional STUN requests over this flow, unless and until a next-hop
   probe later validates the destination.  In addition, the SIP node
   SHOULD remember unvalidated destination nodes that have been used
   within one hour and SHOULD NOT send additional STUN messages to any
   of these destinations.  Note that until STUN support has been
   verified, an initial STUN failure over UDP is not considered a flow
   failure.  For UDP flows, an unvalidated flow can still be reused for
   SIP traffic, however for unvalidated TCP or TLS over TCP flows, the
   connection over which STUN requests were sent MUST be closed.

4. Interaction of SIP, STUN and SigComp over TCP clearly wastes
   bandwidth, exactly on cases where SigComp would otherwise be
   useful to save bandwidth. Instead of sending a couple of bytes
   (CRLF keepalive) each keepalive would consist of more than 30 bytes
   (13 bytes of SigComp shim header plus 20 bytes of STUN header):

   For TCP-based flows, SigComp requires that all messages are processed
   by the SigComp compressor to facilitate framing.  For these
   transports, STUN messages are sent encapsulated in the SigComp "well-
   known shim header" as described in Section 11 of [I-D.ietf-rohc-
   sigcomp-impl-guide].


For an UA that would support Outbound only over TCP using
CRLF keepalives, all that complicated processing together
with waste of round-trips and bandwidth would be easily avoided.


>Previously we had recorded consensus to use STUN for keepalive with =20
>both TCP and UDP.=20

In my understanding that concensus was reached by hums in
IETF#65 meeting in Dallas. My observation from the meeting was
that the discussion was focusing to a selection between STUN
and SIP PING as a global keepalive mechanism, which raised a
hectic email rally before the meeting. CRLF was touched but
the debate was really about the choice between STUN and PING.
There were two votes in the meeting, the first one for UDP
keepalive mechanism and the second for TCP. My feeling was that
the meeting participants focused their thoughts very much on
the STUN vs. PING issue so that STUN vs. CRLF was not
considered too carefully before the votes. And as demonstrated
above, the decision made in Dallas brought a number of
complications to Outbound in a way which could not be
anticipated yet in that meeting.

Hi,

There are a few issues I'd like to clarify on proposal 3.

First, I think the "default" recommendation should only cover TCP. The
text can say that, if the terminal supports TLS, the recommendation also
covers TLS. However, in some environments other security mechanisms may
be used, so I don't think clients in such environments should even be
recommended to implement TLS, nor should the whatever-outbound-proxy-set
configuration-mechanism is used in those environments be recommended to
return TLS registrations in such environements.

Second, as I said before, I don't think we shall talk about UDP and its
"history". UDP is a valid transport for SIP. IF someone really wants
this history text I propose we separate it into proposal 4.

Third, since it is only recommended to return TCP information, I guess
it means we will NOT mandate (eventhough we would, if propsoal 3 is
accepted, recommend it) a UA to establish TCP registrations? If so, I
think we could clarify that (either as part of option 2 or 3).=20

Regards,

Christer

Hi

Before answering Dean's poll, I would like to know more about this.

Have you figured out a (reasonable) way for the edge proxy/authoritative 
proxy (or the combination thereof) to switch from UDP to TCP for large 
messages destined for a UAC that uses Outbound?

I'm thinking of the problems in doing that that we discussed briefly in 
these two messages :

Hi,

There are a few issues I'd like to clarify on proposal 3.

First, I think the "default" recommendation should only cover TCP. The
text can say that, if the terminal supports TLS, the recommendation also
covers TLS. However, in some environments other security mechanisms may
be used, so I don't think clients in such environments should even be
recommended to implement TLS, nor should the whatever-outbound-proxy-set
configuration-mechanism is used in those environments be recommended to
return TLS registrations in such environements.

Second, as I said before, I don't think we shall talk about UDP and its
"history". UDP is a valid transport for SIP. IF someone really wants
this history text I propose we separate it into proposal 4.

Third, since it is only recommended to return TCP information, I guess
it means we will NOT mandate (eventhough we would, if propsoal 3 is
accepted, recommend it) a UA to establish TCP registrations? If so, I
think we could clarify that (either as part of option 2 or 3).=20

Regards,

Christer

Hi

Before answering Dean's poll, I would like to know more about this.

Have you figured out a (reasonable) way for the edge proxy/authoritative 
proxy (or the combination thereof) to switch from UDP to TCP for large 
messages destined for a UAC that uses Outbound?

I'm thinking of the problems in doing that that we discussed briefly in 
these two messages :

Thanks

Hi,

I agree with Francois here. Even though there may be some performance
limitations for TCP in the current implementations, I think that almost
everyone agrees that it is the way to go in the long run. This is why it
would be good to have an optimal solution for Outbound/TCP, instead of
trying to keep consistency between UDP and TCP.

It would be great if we could do UAs supporting Outbound with TCP/TLS
only, and leave mess with message size, fragment handling, UDP-based
security, 20 second NAT keepalive timers etc. behind us. This may not be
realistic yet, if there are enough service providers who will demand UDP
(since unfortunately there are e.g. SBCs that do not even have a proper
TCP support at all), but that should be the aim.  =20

3GPP IMS networks, if such are deployed in the "puristic" form, may be a
different thing, but even there TCP is a better option.=20

Hello To all,
   
                  Recently I read an article and I came across the following line, 
   
  "Software or hardware appliance containing one or more SIP user agents".
   
               My doubt is considering a phone equipment, can it contain two SIP user agents in it? if yes, can any one tell me about the operation of both the user agents?
   
  with regards
  Raj,

Hi Erkki,

When you talk about OPTIONS, extra roundtrips etc, you forget that the
edge proxy can insert the keep-alive parameter e.g. in the Path header
(or Service-Route, depending on what happens to Jonathan's route
construct draft) of the REGISTER to indicate its support of STUN.

Regards,

Christer=20

This is a somewhat obscure semantic issue. If a box containing a SIP 
implementation registers twice, in order to accept calls addressed to 
two different AORs, is it one UA or two UAs? You can make an argument 
either way, but this is one way to get two user agents in a piece of 
equipment.

Some might consider it one UA if it is a single application supporting 
multiple addresses and similar function. A clearer case is a PC running 
a phone application and an entirely independent sip Instant Messaging 
application.

Hi Fredrik,

In the 3GPP environment I believe the specs would allow a IPsec 
protected TCP connection from the P-CSCF to the UA using a IPsec SA 
already established by a UDP flow.  If a NAT is present, I am told the 
IPsec traffic would be sent in UDP.  I am not convinced this TCP in UDP 
is an improvement and within the spirit of "sending over a congestion 
controlled transport", but I don't want to go down that rathole.

I don't think there is any desire by anyone to do switchover with 
outbound.  I'm not even convinced that anyone really uses it without 
outbound.  It appears that the folks who want to do TCP or TLS will 
only use that transport (no benefit to using UDP if you already have a 
TCP or TLS connection up), and I suspect that outside the 3GPP case the 
UDP folks are planning to only use UDP and use the "get out of jail 
free" statement in RFC 3261 that says if you tried to switched over and 
got an ICMP error, you go back to sending using UDP.

thanks,
-rohan

Yes, and I also want it optional for edge proxies/registrars.

This is all relative.

Your draft seems to add enormous amounts of complexity -- to both UAs and
outbound proxies -- to get around what you claim to be a performance
bottleneck. First of all, I disagree with the assumption that running TCP
only is that much more of a burden. And secondly, I believe complexity is
the biggest enemy here, much more so than the performance concerns. 

Cheers,
Aki

Hello To all,
   
                  We know that SIP uses TCP or UDP as the transport layer protocol. There is some size restrictions on UDP packets and TCP packets. It is been stated that one packet carries exactly one SIP request or SIP response messages.
   
                  My doubts is if the size of the SIP messages is more than the size of the UDP or TCP packets, then what happens, will the packet will be fragemented or SIP message will be discarded from being transmitted.
   
  with regards
  Raj.

Hi Raj,

=20

If the SIP packet is too large, message must be represented in "short"
format.

=20

Subject: [Sip] Message size - regarding

=20

Hello To all,

=20

                We know that SIP uses TCP or UDP as the transport layer
protocol. There is some size restrictions on UDP packets and TCP
packets. It is been stated that one packet carries exactly one SIP
request or SIP response messages.

=20

                My doubts is if the size of the SIP messages is more
than the size of the UDP or TCP packets, then what happens, will the
packet will be fragemented or SIP message will be discarded from being
transmitted.

=20

with regards

Raj.

Hi Vamsi,
=20
Short representation is a part of SIP itself.=20
=20
Any SIP implementation compliant with RFC3261 should be able to =
recognize header in short or normal form. Even a single SIP request can =
have some header in short form and some in normal, although no =
implemenation will do that as they would designed to send messages =
either in short or the long form.=20
=20
However, with this the compression would not be much, espeically if the =
message contains few headers and a large body. In that case sigcomp can =
be used for compessing the messages.
=20
Regards,
Vineet.

Hi Raj,

=20

If the SIP packet is too large, message must be represented in "short" =
format.

Ex:

Hello To all,

No, this draft is not about performance.  This draft is about be able to
use UDP or TCP with Outbound, i.e. be compliant with RFC 3261 (Section
18: "All SIP elements MUST implement UDP and TCP."

The performance issue is about implementers be able to use UDP or TCP or
whatever they want, as explicitly authorized by RFC 3261.

> First of all, I disagree with the assumption that running TCP

This is an implementation problem. Outbound MUST support TCP and UDP
because RFC 3261 says it.  The only thing I ask is to let implementers
do their job.

Well, complexity is relative, and again it is not about performance, but
about compliance.

I am currently implementing my two drafts about fragmentation in my
endpoints and servers, so I will have a better idea of the real
complexity soon.  I will eventually ask the chairs for a slot at the
68th IETF meeting to present this.

	I have a question about the usage of STUN as a keepalive over UDP.  
Are clients supposed to start sending STUN before they try to  
REGISTER? If not, I can see the scenario where a UA sends the  
REGISTER, sets a timer (btw 24-29 seconds) for the first STUN  
keepalive, but before that STUN request is sent, the pinhole closes.  
Both ends will think the flow is ok (the STUN keepalive will open a  
new pinhole, but the UA won't know that), and the mess won't get  
cleaned up until the UA re-registers. Sending the keepalive "soon"  
after the REGISTER would probably solve this problem also, if sending  
before is not acceptable.

Best regards,
Byron Campen

Hi Byron,

We could add text recommending that the UA compare the rport/received
with the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS.  That would appear to solve the problem.
Can you think of any problem with this?

thanks,
-rohan

Hi, Raj

 

         It is no problem for TCP, because TCP can prevent IP fragment by
MTU. Otherwise, UDP can occur to IP fragment.

So, in order to involve this problem, using TCP send SIP  message when the
size of SIP message more than the size of UDP.

But in a SIP transaction, it must use the same transport layer protocol.
Thus there may be a problem, if SIP request use UDP, 

corresponding SIP response use UDP, too. However, SIP response message size
may beyond the size of UDP. If the SIP response

is sent by UDP,  IP fragment will be  appearance.

Subject: [Sip] Message size - regarding

 

Hello To all,

 

                We know that SIP uses TCP or UDP as the transport layer
protocol. There is some size restrictions on UDP packets and TCP packets. It
is been stated that one packet carries exactly one SIP request or SIP
response messages.

 

                My doubts is if the size of the SIP messages is more than
the size of the UDP or TCP packets, then what happens, will the packet will
be fragemented or SIP message will be discarded from being transmitted.

 

with regards

Raj.

My doubts is if the size of the SIP messages is more than the size of the UDP

This reasoning sounds very confusing to me.

Is your suggestion really like this:

a) You do not actually have any technical reason why Outbound
   must support UDP, not even the performance would do.=20

b) The only reason for Outbound to support UDP would be its
   full compatibility to RFC 3261.

If this is the case, I would ask WG to consider this reasoning
very carefully and if it makes any sense or not. To me it sounds
like: "UDP is actually not needed but because the WG decided to
mandate it a few years ago, it just has to be there."

According to your I-D the client has to anyway support TCP (or
other congestion controlled transport) so it would not even allow
to implement UDP-only clients (which might be desirable for
some vendors that currently only support UDP). Thus what is
the point with the UDP flows ? Why could they not be optional
for an UA ?

Regards,

Erkki

Hi,

It seems to me that the I-D Preventing Fragmentation for
Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
written by Marc Petit-Huguenin demonstrates very well the resons=20
why UDP support for Outbound UAs should be made optional. Trying=20
to really solve the problems with UDP together with Outbound would=20
make the total solution more and more complex.=20

>> Proposal 2: Make outbound registrations over UDP flows=20
>optional for UAs.
>>=20
>> Yes (Accept the proposal) or No (Reject the proposal).
>
>No

Based on another email from Marc I understood that the reason
to his No is the compatibility to RFC 3261 which mandates UDP.
I would like to know if there any other, more technical reasons=20
(rather than the old WG decision within RFC 3261) to mandate UDP=20
with Outbound ? This far I have not heard any convincing one.

Regards,

Erkki

just a reality check.  yesterday when i was going to make some sip tcp
tests, i tried to find a sip phone that supports tcp.  the most popular
ones from linksys/sipura (cisco) and grandstream didn't.

No, performance is still the reason why *I* will mix UDP and TCP in my
endpoints and servers.  The discussions about making UDP obsolete are
not new, it is always someone claiming that SIP over TCP has the same
performances than SIP over UDP, it is just that the SIP implementers are
morons who do not know how to use select or poll, or epoll, etc...
At first I believed this, and I was ready to move all our customers to
TCP only, until something I read made me doubt this.  So I asked our QA
department to write some tests and to run them on our servers.  The I-D
was written because of the result of this tests.

The problem with performance is that if I publish my results someone
else will come with different results to prove the opposite.  Also not
everybody is interested in performance.  I am, because we have to pay
for every server, data center, etc... to run SIP.  I guess that the
vendors selling the servers, or the software licenses does not care as much.

So I think that we should accept that different members of this WG have
different needs and that we should not have any performance discussion,
as long as the implementers have the tools they need to design servers
and endpoints that works for them.

So this is why I am switching my focus from performance to 1) do not
prevent implementers to use UDP if they need it and 2) anyway RFC 3261
mandates UDP AND TCP on all elements.

This is a good enough reason.

UDP-only clients are not SIP compliant.  So how a UDP flow can be
optional if UDP in the endpoint is not?

Jari,

In chapter 4.3.1 In my opinion the "path" parameter shall be stated as
mandatory.

In chapter 4.6.3 the same handling is defined for selector locating
non-existing element and multiple elements. I'd rather distinguish these
cases as subscription to non-existing element may have real usage (as
stated in chapter 4.1), but subscription to multiple elements (in the
sense of one selector for multiple elements) shall not be possible at
all.

Regards,

Pavel

Hi all!

I've submitted an event package i-d=20

about syncing xcap resources with xcap-diff format. The event package=20

probably an OMA requirement to have subscriptions to XCAP components=20

Not even RFC3261 manages to get you everything if using UDP though - 
large messages for one, security (SIPS) for another.

As I see it, it is too complicated to try and make SIP over UDP work 
across NATs to even try it. For those cases where the properties of 
Outbound are desired, everyone will be better off using TCP.

For the cases where you have small messages, don't require security and 
don't have to worry about NATs or firewalls in your network paths, then 
UDP is fine (if I don't think about the re-inveted reliability). I don't 
mind anyone using it where it actually works.

I'm genuinely worried though that Outbound with UDP won't actually work 
in the field once finished, because of something we fail to think of at 
this time.

If anyone can tell me of some other UDP based network application that 
actually attempts to work through NATs by using keepalives (that means: 
not DNS), and without users configuring their NAT with port forwards or 
similar then please tell me so that I don't have to worry that we're 
spending all this energy chasing a solution that might not even exist in 
the first place. There must be some kind of precedence in this area, I'm 
sure.

/Fredrik

Let's exclude SIPS from the discussion, as DTLS can be used here.

Yes, large messages must go through TCP, but the reality is that not all
messages mandates to use TCP, and this is especially true for messages
that are sent periodically, REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE for example.

RFC 3261 already can mix UDP and TCP when there is no NAT[1].  The
problem here is that it not longer works behind a NAT, even with
Outbound.  My proposal is to extend Outbound so it works the same way.

Outbound with UDP does not work.  Because of this some people want to
exclude UDP from Outbound, which is inconvenient for implementers who
care about performance.   What I am proposing is to make UDP working
with Outbound instead of excluding it.

Remember that this is not the endpoint that decide to use UDP or TCP,
its the servers (i.e. NAPTR records as described by RFC 3263).  If the
server decides that the endpoint must use TCP, then everything is fine
with Outbound.  But if the server decides that the endpoint must use UDP
(and switch to TCP if the message is too big), then things breaks for
the cases described in my draft, i.e. incoming messages too big and
outgoing responses too big.

I think it is perfectly reasonable to say that a new enhancement to SIP
(eg Outbound) is defined to work only over certain transports, if doing
so is either required to make it work at all, to limit the complexity of
the specification, or to make the resulting implementations more robust
in the wild.

Hi Juha,

I proposed that since edge proxies and registrars have to support both
UDP and TCP, UAs that want to implement outbound for TCP don't have to
also implement outbound for UDP.  My proposal does not prevent
UDP-only devices from working.

I would also like to point out that devices that don't support TCP are
not compliant with RFC 3261.  I suspect one of the reasons these
devices have not implemented TCP is because the devices you mentioned
are usually used in a residential setting and therefore need a
standardized mechanism to get inbound requests when they are behind a
NAT.  This was the original intent of outbound and the title of the
document reflects that: " Managing Client Initiated *Connections*".
There are clearly people who want to implement this spec for TCP, so I
don't see what the problem is with finally doing something that makes
it so we can have interoperable implementations that use TCP behind
NATs.

thanks,
-rohan

Marc,

To date, I think you are the only person who has spoken on the list
who actually wants to use TCP for some requests and UDP for others.

What I have heard from the UDP-apologist crowd is generally that they
are using UDP for either historical reasons (with which I sympathize)
or for performance reasons (of which I am skeptical).  The historical
argument basically boils down to having a large number of components
that will all would need to be replaced or drastically reconfigured at
once.  I think the language I proposed explains and makes room for
this.

On the performance side, I consistently hear several UDP-apologists
concerned with the maximum number of connections they can handle.
Your approach does nothing to address this concern since it ends up in
the same number of TCP connections as the pure-TCP approach.  From the
TCP-advocates I hear that in their implementations they can handle a
very large number of TCP connections by getting rid of poll/select,
and that they can handle about the same number of UAs using UDP as
TCP.  The performance bottleneck I usually hear about with these
implementations is access to the registration/location server
database.  (I have also heard about the registration/location server
database being a bottleneck in UDP-only implementations as well.) Your
approach would effectively double the number of entries in the
registration database and therefore seems to make things worse rather
than better.  Certainly it does not address the perceived performance
problems of either the pro-UDP or the pro-TCP crowd.

thanks,
-rohan

No, this is not how it would work.   The TCP connections are temporary,
not permanent.

I think that we can compare this to a HTTP server.  Even if I am
constantly logged in slashdot.org, there is no permanent TCP connection
between my browser and slashdot.org's HTTP server.  This is because it
is more efficient to close the connection at the end of the transaction,
and to open a new one when I click on reload.

So there is 3 possible combinations of transports for SIP; UDP alone,
permanent TCP and UDP + temporary TCP.  I excluded UDP alone, because of
the fragmentation problem. So we wrote two tests with the same kind of
transactions an endpoints would do, the first test with a permanent TCP
connection, and the second test with a mix of UDP and temporary TCP.
The TCP/UDP mixed test, even if it have to create TCP connections and
close them each time a SIP message bigger than the MTU have to be sent
or received, was using half the resources of the test with the permanent
TCP connection.  And the UDP+TCP test was using the additional mechanism
to request the opening of the TCP connection.

So the idea is that at a specific time, a specific flow can use UDP or
TCP but not both.  The transport for the flow changes depending on what
needs to be used for incoming request or outgoing response.  After the
end of the transaction that needed TCP, the TCP flows is replaced by an
UDP flow and the TCP connection is closed.

Obviously this works only if the transaction that create the flow, i.e.
the REGISTER, does not need TCP.  If it is the case, then the only
transactions that need TCP are INVITE that carries a big SDP (thanks to
ICE) and the NOTIFY that carries big XML documents.

Doesn't this all go down the drain when you add (D)TLS to the mix? The
relative costs of establishment are orders of magnitude different right?
(I wish I had that number off the top of my head, but I don't) That's
really the thing that's swayed me with these debates since we shouldn't
be counting on non-use of crypto going forward.

yes, i didn't actually comment on your proposal, but just how far from
rfc3261 requirements the real world is.

we already have that.  after i finally found a sip tcp implementation
(in nokia phone), i made the phone to register from behind symmetric NAT
with my OpenSER based proxy.  the proxy kept tcp connection persistently
open and i didn't have any trouble of making both in and outbound calls
from that phone.

no non-rfc3261 compliant features were in use in the phone.  thus i
still fail to see what value add would outbound give now when its REAL
value add has been removed, i.e., mandating the phone to register with
more than one proxy.

right, the intention is to allow subscription to an non-existing element 
(as it is stated). However,  do you propose  something along the lines: 
exists = "single", "none" or "multiple" ? So none and multiple would be 
an "error" in XCAP sense where a unique node is always mandatory for a 
successful operation. Having these two separate states might be better, 
i.e. the client would probably know to change the request. Also it would 
be better in-line with XCAP where 404 and 409 error responses separate 
these cases. However, the initial subscription must then signal this 
multiple case, I suppose. So it would make the handling a bit more 
complex, but more deterministic.

Comments ?

Hi,

I see no reason why the UA should need to send STUN BEFORE the REGISTER,
but I agree it should do it very soon after it has received the REGISTER
response - which may include information whether the edge proxy supports
STUN in the first place.

Regards,

Christer =20

 Hi,

please find below the announcement for the updated draft on the SIP
Identity BCP describing the use of SIP Identity for the protection of
credential exchange between clients.
We updated the draft and discussed the use cases more elaborately and
also included the handling of the reverse direction using the connected
identity approach.

We would be interested if this work is seen as useful in the scope of
the SIP WG at is is right now or if additions are needed.

Regards
	Steffen

directories.


	Title		: SIP Identity Usage BCP

This document describes a use case for RFC4474 (SIP Identity) for
   verifying a certificate that might not be publicly verifiable by
   traditional means.  It provides a best current practice document for
   binding an identity to a certificate for the duration of a session.
   The certificate may then be used to bootstrap further security
   parameters, e.g., for securing media data.  A discussion of possible
   enhancements is included in the appendix.  Editors Note: The first
   version of this draft was discussed in the SIPPING WG.  As the target
   of this draft is a BCP for current issues, the draft was updated and
   submitted to the SIP WG.

Note that you may be the first to consider implementing this. I've asked
around and haven't heard of an implementation. So answers are somewhat
speculative.

I think this is not entirely clear, but its not clear what it would mean
if you were to attempt it. Also, each offer must be matched to an
answer. If there were multiple early-session offers, then there would
need be multiple early session answers. In that case, there would need
to be some convention to decide which early answer goes with which early
offer.

Getting early-session to work at all is enough of a challenge. Getting
multiple early sessions to work seems like folly.

Well, that is an issue isn't it. It assumes that you don't want to
handle them all. This problem exists with early media in forking
situations without use of early-session, and in fact was one of the
reasons early-session was proposed. If you introduce multiple early
sessions, then in some sense the problem has been reintroduced.

>     This question arises from the following scene:
>     Before A and B establish communication
>     (1) AS-1 wants to send media to B
>     (2) AS-2 wants to send media to A

Is this in the context of IMS?

To be able to do this, the AS's must be UAs. For the call flow you show,
both AS-1 and AS-2 must act as B2BUAs. To make sense of all this, and
achieve the sessions you show, I think they must have a lot of
understanding of what is going on in this particular case. In the
abstract I don't see how they could know that, but in a particular case
perhaps that is possible.

In the case you show it appears to me that you might never have to
include two early-session descriptions in the same message. Instead,
wouldn't one be removed, because it is being handled, and another added
to be handled on a different leg? But its hard to say for sure without a
concrete example of exactly what you are trying to do.

IMO you are on a dangerous course in uncharted waters. It would be
better if you found a more mainstream way to do what you want. Since
apparently you have a B2BUA at each step, I think you could probably
achieve what you want in a more straightforward way by carefully
managing the contents of standard offers and answers along the way.

Hello!

I am writing a load balancing SIP proxy and would like to keep it as
simple as possible, ie. I would like to avoid using any databases.

Currently I have come up with the following solution:

When first INVITE arrives, calculate branch parameter, determine the
server to forward the message to, store the relation between branch
and server name in database. When another message in this session
arrives (the same branch parameter of Via header) the server name is
looked up from database and the message is forwarded to that server.

Can I put some header or parameter for some header in the message
that client would be required to include in the next request message
it sends out during the session?

Thanks!

Its not clear to me why you need to do anything.

If the server is the UAS, then it will return a Contact header with the 
uri to be used for additional requests in the session. If your proxy is 
even involved in the subsequent messages, then it will simply forward to 
that address, which will be in the R-URI.

If the server you selected is a proxy, and if it wants to be involved in 
subsequent in-dialog requests, then it can Record-Route. And if *your* 
proxy wants to be in subsequent requests in the dialog, then it also 
should Record-Route.

What more is required here?

Hi Marc,

What is the edge proxy supposed to do when it wants to deliver a large
INVITE request to the UA and the UA does not have a TCP-connection
established at the moment?

thanks,

As I proposed in my draft[1], the edge proxy sends a STUN ForceCCP[2]
request over UDP to the UA to replace the flow by a TCP flow.  The edge
proxy can then use the TCP connection to send the INVITE.  The TCP flow
is replaced by an UDP flow at the end of the SIP transaction, or after 5
seconds if there is no SIP transaction.  The TCP connection is then closed.

Note that the draft is missing lot of stuff, e.g. how an edge proxy
knows that the endpoint supports this, etc...

Practically speaking given where we are today, I would be a fan of a  
solution that meant the following goals:

1) allowed deployments that wanted to use TCP to use TCP

2) allowed deployments that wanted to use UDP to use only UDP with  
the known limitations that the UA would not be able to send large  
requests

3) allowed deployments that wanted to use both UDP and TCP to do so  
and not have the size limitations by using switchover

(note it would be easy to  meet the above goals using any type of  
keep alive so they do no impact if we use CRLF or something else)

Now I know there are people on the list that only care about one of  
these three goals but I know there are some people that want each  
one. I think that if we had some agreement that we were trying to  
meet these goals, then it would be easier for Rohan and I to help  
make progress on a proposal that everyone found agreeable. Perhaps  
Rohan's proposal meets these. I understand Rohan is making the  
argument that 2 is not needed because 3261 does not allow 2 - some  
people disagree with this regardless it is is clear that the bulk of  
deployments today are in category 2 for a variety of good reasons.

I just don't want to hold up outbound with figuring out the problems  
of TCP vs. UDP. Or figuring out how to do high reliability in SIP  
proxy farms. Or figuring out how to exactly build very scaleable  
proxy farms. Or figuring out how to deal with some security problems  
with changing IPs on UAs. All of these things are separable from  
outbound and though work is needed on them, I think we can finish  
this work without solving all o f them. I'd rather not spend endless  
time discussing if outbound should only work for IPv6 to help  
encourage people to move to v6 but instead try and find something  
that we could all live with and meant the needs of at least a bunch  
of deployments.

So if we can agree on above sort of goals, I think it will help me  
understand how to come up with some proposal that take into account   
what people are saying on this poll.

I think we have heard from the people that think STUN is a good idea  
why they think STUN is a good idea. I think we previously came to the  
idea that the double CRLF was better than the CRLF so I would rather  
compare to double CRLF in the poll.

I don't understand the question. The problems around this seem to be  
around difference between use and implement and this questions does  
not help me figure out what to put in the draft. I think I am also  
confused on how this differs from what we have in the draft today.  
Anyway, color me confused.

I think this needs some discussion before you take a poll on it.  
Perhaps people who have said yes to this can propose how a UA behind  
a firewall will be able to tell if can accept incoming TCP flows? How  
would the system doing the setting of the outbound-proxy-set know?

I think to get some facts on the table it would also be nice to  
understand:

What percentage of commercially available proxies today support high  
reliability with over 100k connections?

What percentage of commercially available proxies do switch over from  
UDP to TCP on large requests?

Do we have the standards in place to build UAs that work with high  
reliability TCP systems on a large scale.

Errors-To: sip-bounces@ietf.org

as i mentioned in an earlier message, i finally found a SIP phone that
supports SIP over TCP (Nokia N80).  during the past days i have done
some tests with it.  the setup is this:

N80 -- WLAN -- AP -- Linux with iptables NAT -- internet -- OpenSER proxy/reg

OpenSER proxy is configured to use persistent TCP connections to the
registrar if SIP UA is behind NAT.  this means that it keeps the TCP
connection open to the UA a few minutes longer than the registration
interval advertised by the phone.  it does not currently send any TCP
keepalive messages, but could be made to do so.  if SIP request comes in
bound to the UA, it reuses the existing TCP connection.

N80 registers every 3600 seconds and, in addition, it is sending a 4
byte TCP keepalive message after every 20 minutes if there has been no
other activity.  wireshark reports the TCP keepalive messages as
Continuation messages.

during the tests i have not seen any problems whatsoever.  the same TCP
connection stays up and both ways useable forever unless there is a
equipment failure.  

i still fail to see what exactly is the problem is that outbound tries
to solve which has warranted hundreds if not thousands of messages on
this mailing list.  i really would have liked to see that energy spend
on solving real problems, such as how to build a resilient, load
balancing SIP architecture.

Hi Cullen, I don't believe this is the core problem.

The problem with UDP is more that the UA will not be able to RECEIVE
large requests over UDP.

You could always build your UA to no send large requests and avoid the
fragmentation problem, but you can not force other people's products to
not use large requests.

Many PSTN gateways and Softswitches always send large INVITEs for
example,
and they will always fragment. And I might add that many very popular
NAT/routers don't support UDP fragmentation.

The consequence of this is that point 2 really doesn't exist in real
life=20
except in closed environments where you control the other UAs as well.

A UA has to have an opened TCP connection "just in case" the other side
sends
a large request, which is quite likely.

So, what you are really saying is that one may want to support UDP
for closed environments where fragmentation is known not to be possible.
This
could be for example an Enterprise Network where you control all the
equipment
that is allowed. I do not have a problem with having words to that
effect in
the text, and words explaining the problem with fragmentation and
incoming=20
requests.

(That being said, I believe that in practice, it means that using
outbound
for UDP will just prove to be essentially useless: too complicated, and
too likely
to fail).

> 3) allowed deployments that wanted to use both UDP and TCP to=20
> do so and not have the size limitations by using switchover

What does this really mean? You mean a UA will open two connections, one
for UDP and
another for TCP?

Yes, that would be the consequence of the previous point. I fail to see
why on earth
anybody would do this instead of just using a single TCP connection.

Ooops - my bad, you are right - I should have put I was thinking of  
this as someone trying to send to the UA that registered but realized  
I phrased this all wrong

Well, it's seems very reasonable for any network (even one that only  
uses TCP) to have a policy on maximum request (or response) size and  
reject requests larger than this.

Hmm - I wish we had better specifics here - I will point out there  
are millions of endpoints on well known residential endpoints that  
are working through NATs and connected to PSTN gw and softwswiches  
that are working over UDP.

Could you point me at a non enterprise deployment that is not in  
point 2? I suspect there are some but the bulk seem to be form 2.

I think this is only true when the policy allows messages larger than  
what can be done over UDP. I'm not arguing that 2 is a better way to  
deploy than 1 or 3, just that there are a lot of people that do 2 and  
that I think more work is needed to make 1 or 3 feasible so that this  
draft should not take on trying to eliminate deployments like 2

Uh, no - I was saying that outbound over UDP is usable in cases where  
the policy is to reject messages that are too large for UDP. I agree  
that limits the functionality of the communications with the UA that  
registered over this UDP only network but that was that deployments  
choice.

Note what I am talking about here is all about deployments using TCP  
or UDP. I don't mind about if a UA has to implement both.

I think the folks that favor these approach would use a scheme where  
the UDP connection was long lived and the TCP connection was short  
lived for the large messages. The advantages of this would be to get  
the scaleability and reliability schemes that are easier with UDP yet  
still be able to do large messages. I'm not saying that I think these  
schemes are a  good idea or not -- but my feeling is that we can  
finish outbound and leave it open such that three of these are  
possible and future drafts can suggest which ones are best and when  
they should be used.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Guidelines for the use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: F. Audet
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-sips-00.txt
	Pages		: 39
	Date		: 2006-12-4
	
This document providing clarifications and guidelines concerning the
   use of SIPS URI scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It
   does not make normative changes to SIP.  This document also provides
   discussion of possible future steps in specification, and the pros
   and cons of making such changes.

Well, Outbound is not deployed yet, neither for TCP nor for UDP.

What I'm trying to say, is that I fail to see a case where
outbound-UDP-only
would work on the global internet (at least with our current wording in
RFC 3261).

You would ALWAYS need to open an outbound TCP connection "just-in-case".

Unless, well, unless we start making "assumptions" like:

- Switching to TCP will never happen, because:
  - Messages will never be too big for the path MTU
  - If they are, it is "ok" to fragment UDP (change from 3261)
  - If UDP does fragment, it is assumed that it will work
    - If there is a NAT, it will be good enough to support UDP
fragmentation

Again,

I'm ok with having outbound support STUN-over-UDP, as long as we are
honest about
the implications regarding fragmentation. This could be as simple as
explaining that
if you don't keep a TCP channel opened, request that are bigger than MTU
and would
observe the rules of RFC 3261/18.1.1 would not be able to be received.=20

If we have a user agent that has one TCP and one UDP flow open to each 
proxy in the outbound proxy set, and these happen to be edge proxies - 
what happens when a large request is being sent towards the UA?

The authoritative proxy looks up all the bindings in the location 
database, and sends it to one of the edge proxys (edge-proxy1) with

   Route: <sip:flow-xyz@edge-proxy1.example.com;ob>

If flow-xyz was a TCP flow, that would just work - the request would 
reach the UA. However, if it is a UDP flow, it won't work for this 
particular request. The flow is fine, so a '430 Flow Failed' is not 
applicable.

In the lack of a proposed idea about how this should work technically, I 
don't think it is meaningful to discuss this variant of Outbound 
(TCP+UDP) any further, since we would all be discussing different 
things. I know this problem can be solved, but it won't come for free 
and I always want to know the price before considering whether to buy 
something. I hope the same applies to the SIP WG.

There's a draft out that proposes how to handle 3), which I personally
find incredibly complex. To accept such complexity, I think we'd need to
have some pretty convincing reasons for it. So far, it seems, the most
convincing I've heard are "because RFC3261 says so" and "because we
don't implement TCP".

There are plenty of people on this list who've said that the best way to
deal with 2) and 3) is to *not* deal with them. I think the proposal on
the table meets 2) in that it allows for deployments to be UDP-only, but
also instructs people that this will likely only work in a tightly
controlled environment, not in the Internet.

People keep bringing up this point about existing deployments. Clearly,
these existing deployments must be working through NAT just dandy, since
otherwise they wouldn't exist. 

Then what are these deployments expecting the SIP WG to deliver? A new
keepalive mechanism, so that they need to upgrade all of their
equipment, after which they will work exactly the same way as before,
but with added complexity?

Somehow I don't believe that people would go through all that trouble of
implementing STUN and SIP+STUN muxing for no other benefit than being
able to add one more RFC to their product sheets.

Even if we made outbound TCP-only, people would be free to use UDP in
their deployments, just like they are at the moment.

I want to point out you're the first person to mention IPv6 in this
context. Let me also point out that drawing any parallels between
discussion of using TCP with SIP to using SIP over IPv6-only is really
uncalled for. There is ample existance proof that apps work well using
TCP, and that TCP is well supported by practically all networking gear
and OSs out there. It's in heavy use and has been for 15 years in the
web. In other words, nothing in the Internet needs to change in order to
use SIP over TCP. This is not the IPv6 vs. IPv4 religious war.

We also have data to back up the claim that TCP scales as well as UDP
with SIP. I have yet to hear any description of concrete problems with
using TCP as transport, and in fact, it strikes me as odd that you're
attempting to make this discussion into something it's not.

I said yes, because I can live with this especially if it pleases the
UDP-only crowd.

The short answer here is, they won't ever just know. And because they
won't ever know, they will be better off by simply using a persistent
TCP connection to the outbound proxy. It's actually the UDP-only crowd's
concern to figure out when and where they can use UDP-only.

You seem to suggest we have not; that high reliability is not possible
with TCP. Can you be more specific? What are the concrete problems?

In my opinion "none" and "single" is ok and I would prefer that
subscription is rejected or terminated in case of "multiple".
Your opinion?

Hi Cullen,

If so, then how would those endpoints get any benefit from Outbound ?
What would be the value added for those deployments if those endpoints=20
would be changed as Outbound UDP compliant endpoints ? Multiple=20
registration support and new types of keepalive messages i.e. some
added reliability ?

But if those endpoints and proxies anyway have to be either upgraded=20
or replaced for Outbound, then why couldn't that upgrade cover TCP
support as well ? What is the ultimate benefit for using UDP instead
of TCP for those deployments ?

Please remember that the proposal that you do not agree with was
like this:

> Proposal 2: Make outbound registrations over UDP flows optional for=20
> UAs.

Outbound over UDP would still be possible and probably supported by
those UA vendors who get significant gain for it. But some UAs=20
targetting to other deployments could just opt to support TCP.
What is wrong with that ?

If it is the deployments choice to limit the functionality of the
communications with the UA registered, why could it not be possible
for the specific closed deployments to administratively (or technically)
limit the deployed UAs to be such that implement UDP ? Why would you
mandate ALL the implemented UAs to support UDP for Outbound ? Those
deployments could just tell the users not to aqcuire any UAs which
only support Outbound with TCP, if the proxies (or operator policy)
does not support TCP (or does not support persistent TCP connections).

Please remember the Outbound draft does make such a scheme possible !
If the UA does NOT have a long lived persistent TCP connection
available, there is no way for the proxy to get the UA to open
such connection or for the proxy itself open such a TCP connection
towards the UA via the NAT when a large message arrives destined
to the UA. So if the UA does not keep the TCP connection open
all the time, it has to live with the limitation of not being
able to receive SIP requests bigger than MTU if the NAT discards
fragmented UDP packets.

P.S. Actually there is such a mechanism for that specified in Marc=20
Petit-Huguenin's I-D "Preventing Fragmentation for Client Initiated
Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" - but that
is not within the baseline Outbound spec and there is no normative
binding between those specs either.

Regards,

Erkki

During the past semester, I organized a VoIP seminar at Columbia  
University, consisting of student presentations, labs and a semester  
project, in addition to guest lectures. You can see some of the  
course materials at

http://metro-north.cs.columbia.edu:8080/x/PwI

Note that any code or slides are copyrighted by the respective  
authors, so please ask before using material. If you have suggestions  
or <ad>would like to take the class the next time it is offered via  
Columbia's distance learning program</ad>, let me know.

Henning

The problem is that none of those deployments are (yet) using the 
boatload of features like identity, e2m, complex route-header cookies, 
and other Very Important Stuff that we think might be likely to happen. 
But when that stuff starts to happen, UDP fragmentation will start to 
occur. We don't yet know how much will break as a result. But my guess 
is "a lot".

How about we rip out UDP, fix the Outbound stuff, fix the 
route-construction stuff, fix the early-media stuff. and call it SIP 3.0?

good idea, but you forgot to add SIPS to the rip out list.

Consider the following scenario:


UA1        Proxy      UA2/PUA
| SUBSCRIBE |            |
|---------->|            |
|           |  SUBSCRIBE |
|           |----------->|
|           |   200 OK   |
|           |<-----------|
|  200 OK   |            |
|<----------|            |
|           |     NOTIFY |
|           |  ??<-------|
|           |            |

Further assume that the Proxy added a Record-Route header to the
SUBSCRIBE request.

Perhaps I just overlooked this but 3265 and 3856 do not explicity say
how the NOTIFY is to be routed.  Should 1) the NOTIFY request be routed
through the proxy using the address in the Record-Route header or 2)
sent directly to the UA1 per the Contact header in the SUBSCRIBE
request?  I guess if I read 3261 correctly about requests within a
dialog, I would assume case 2 but presence of the Record-Route has me
confused.

Thanks,
FM

Hi, 
     Can any one give pointers where to start for SMS over VoIP.  Any RFCs?
Any pointer from where to start will be highly appreciable. Is the rfc 3761
appropriate for implmenting SMS via VoIP?
 
thanks & regards,
 vamsi.

HI

=20

If an UAC is configured to use the UDP port and a SIP Proxy is
configured to use TCP port.

The UAC is keep sending messages in UDP port, but Sip Proxy don't
respond, since it is listening on TCP port.

=20

In this scenario, how UAC should know that Proxy is listening on TCP
Port....???

=20

Thanks

Adarsh.

Hi Dale,
 	 Thanks for the message.  But for MESSAGE conversation, what kind of
codec is used, that is audio codec or any other specified codec?  As per RFC
3551 Audio and video codecs are specified.  

Thanks & regards,
Annasagaram vamsi.

Hi Vamsi,
 
If you are considering to transport traditional SMS service over SIP, 3GPP
23.204/24.341 is dealing with this topic.
It is based on SIP MESSAGE request. You can get the specs from
http://www.3gpp.org/specs/specs.htm.
 
If you are considering implementing SMS-like service by SIP, the MESSAGE
request is ready for you.
 
Cheers.
Peili

Hi, 
     Can any one give pointers where to start for SMS over VoIP.  Any RFCs?
Any pointer from where to start will be highly appreciable. Is the rfc 3761
appropriate for implmenting SMS via VoIP?
 
thanks & regards,
 vamsi.

   If an UAC is configured to use the UDP port and a SIP Proxy is
   configured to use TCP port.

   The UAC is keep sending messages in UDP port, but Sip Proxy don't
   respond, since it is listening on TCP port.

   In this scenario, how UAC should know that Proxy is listening on
   TCP Port....???

If the UAC decides to send a message to a SIP proxy, it must have
learned, by some method, the SIP proxy's host address, port number,
and protocol on which it is listening.  This information is derived
from the SIP URI which the UAC attempts to send to.  The process is
described in RFC 3263.

   Thanks for the message.  But for MESSAGE conversation, what kind of
   codec is used, that is audio codec or any other specified codec?
   As per RFC 3551 Audio and video codecs are specified.

A MESSAGE request contains the text content directly.  See RFC 3438
for details.  (I don't think anyone has specified how to carry
recorded audio segments as messages.)

For extended interchange of messages, as Fenar says, you set up a
dialog (using INVITE) and specify the use of MSRP in the SDP.

As others have noted, if you want to interoperage with 3GPP, its
specificaitons are available.

There are 2 models in SIP for sending IMs (paging and session).

Paging mode has the UA client sending the MESSAGE method to pass the
information. Please refer to RFC 3428.

Session mode has the UA client sending the INVITE method to establish a
session first.

For SMS via SIP, the MESSAGE method carrying the text
within the body of the method to the SMSC (or application server)
mimics 2G.

The establishment of a session via INVITE mimics IM where
peer information can be relayed, such as "typing".

   Thanks for the message.  But for MESSAGE conversation, what kind of
   codec is used, that is audio codec or any other specified codec?
   As per RFC 3551 Audio and video codecs are specified.

A MESSAGE request contains the text content directly.  See RFC 3438
for details.  (I don't think anyone has specified how to carry
recorded audio segments as messages.)

For extended interchange of messages, as Fenar says, you set up a
dialog (using INVITE) and specify the use of MSRP in the SDP.

As others have noted, if you want to interoperage with 3GPP, its
specificaitons are available.

It took me some time to parse through this but sounds like you and I  
are in 100% agreement on what an acceptable solution would look like.

While you are working on this, I think we should publish outbound? It  
solves a useful goal now and probably works towards the right  
direction of what you would propose as a replace for SIP 2.0.

Yes 100% agree - we should explain the bad implications of not having  
a TCP channel open.

I agree 100% with #1 and #2. I find #3 to be of dubious value, although 
I see no harm in a solution that has that property as well (and you seem 
to get it for free if you satisfy #1 and #2).

I concur with Adam, with the caveat that any unforseen complexities  
that might be introduced by the phrase "not have the size limitations  
by using switchover" not block the work. That is, if 3 is free, or  
cheap, then great--but I would not want to significantly delay 1 and  
2 in order to get 3.

In RFC 3428, section 3, " MESSAGE requests do not establish dialogs".

 Does "Paging mode" mean that with out establishing a actual/voice session,
UA client can send IM to UA server?  


-----Original Message-----

Subject: RE: [Sip] SMS via VoIP



There are 2 models in SIP for sending IMs (paging and session).

Paging mode has the UA client sending the MESSAGE method to pass the
information. Please refer to RFC 3428.

Session mode has the UA client sending the INVITE method to establish a
session first.

For SMS via SIP, the MESSAGE method carrying the text within the body of the
method to the SMSC (or application server) mimics 2G.

The establishment of a session via INVITE mimics IM where peer information
can be relayed, such as "typing".

   Thanks for the message.  But for MESSAGE conversation, what kind of
   codec is used, that is audio codec or any other specified codec?
   As per RFC 3551 Audio and video codecs are specified.

A MESSAGE request contains the text content directly.  See RFC 3438 for
details.  (I don't think anyone has specified how to carry recorded audio
segments as messages.)

For extended interchange of messages, as Fenar says, you set up a dialog
(using INVITE) and specify the use of MSRP in the SDP.

As others have noted, if you want to interoperage with 3GPP, its
specificaitons are available.

Yes, the UAC can send/convey information one way to the UAS.
This information flow feels like sending a message to a pager or 
sending an sms to a mobile.

Hi,
In the SIP messaging specifications, the usage of MESSAGE is limited to
small, short messages while for longer messages like e.g. multi-media
messages including video, pictures etc. MSRP must be used instead.

MESSAGE has been retro-fitted with a capability that enables a user to
specify multiple destinations for a short message (see
draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-message-07). This capabilty needs a messaging
server that explodes the list of destinations and sends the short message to
each destination. However, SIP-based MSRP does not define that capability.
The INVITE that initiates the MSRP session cannot be targeted to mutiple
invitees by the inviting user. The UA must initiate the sessions
individually to each destination and then send the message to all the
destinations. This may lead to either more complex messaging client
implementations in UA or cumbersome usage in comparison to the short
messaging client.

One case where this lack of capability is notorious is in SMS/MMS/IMPS
interworking with IMS. When a GSM user sends an SMS to multiple destinations
this can be directly mapped by the interworking function to a MESSAGE
request including all the destinations in the request.

However, when a GPRS user sends an MMS to multiple destinations, the
interworking function must take care of initiating the SIP and MSRP
sessions, send the message over all sessions and then releasing those
sessions. The same goes for IMPS.

I think it would be advantageous to retro-fit session-based messaging with
the same capability as short messaging. One possible alternative would be to
allow the same MIME body defined in
draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-message-07 in INVITE requests for MSRP sessions.
However this may not seem appropriate since it impacts a rather basic
message of the SIP specification. Any other alternative would require
defining a new mechanism specific for long, multi-media messages, like e.g.
content indirection.

I wonder if there've been some discussions on this issue already? What's the
oppinion of the sipping community on it?

Best regards,

I'm not familiar with the details of MSRP, but I do not see why a forked
INVITE cannot carry an MSRP set-up offer to more than one destination, each
of which will reply with an MSRP set-up answer, thus setting up a set of
MSRP sessions.  (In exactly the same way that a single INVITE can establish
multiple SDP sessions.)

Oops, well, yes, you have to make sure the proxies that do the forking do
not attempt to cancel all-but-one successful branch of the fork.  But that's
a known problem that applies to a lot more situations than setting up MSRP
sessions.  See, e.g., draft-worley-sipping-forking-00 for a discussion,
especially section 3.6.

Beacuse MSRP is inherently session-oriented, I don't think you're going to
get around having to initiate and release SIP/MSRP sessions.

To simplify the internetworking function, perhaps what needs to be done is
to define a way for MSRP relays to act as URI-list services.  That way, the
internetworking function could:
1. Send a forked INVITE to all recipients 2. Gather responses and construct
URI-list 3. Send message and URI-list to URI-list Service The URI-list
Service could then forward the message to all the recipients and relay MSRP
REPORTs back to the internetworking function, who could then send BYE
requests to close the SIP sessions.  Given the constraints that MSRP is
session-oriented (hence requires initiation/release), I think that's about
as simple as it can get.
(Actually, adding such a URI-list capability to MSRP relays seems like a
good idea in general, since it would simplify the implementation of
multi-party chat.)

Hope this helps,

In RFC 3428, section 3, " MESSAGE requests do not establish dialogs".

 Does "Paging mode" mean that with out establishing a actual/voice session,
UA client can send IM to UA server?

There are 2 models in SIP for sending IMs (paging and session).

Paging mode has the UA client sending the MESSAGE method to pass the
information. Please refer to RFC 3428.

Session mode has the UA client sending the INVITE method to establish a
session first.

For SMS via SIP, the MESSAGE method carrying the text within the body of the
method to the SMSC (or application server) mimics 2G.

The establishment of a session via INVITE mimics IM where peer information
can be relayed, such as "typing".

   Thanks for the message.  But for MESSAGE conversation, what kind of
   codec is used, that is audio codec or any other specified codec?
   As per RFC 3551 Audio and video codecs are specified.

A MESSAGE request contains the text content directly.  See RFC 3438 for
details.  (I don't think anyone has specified how to carry recorded audio
segments as messages.)

For extended interchange of messages, as Fenar says, you set up a dialog
(using INVITE) and specify the use of MSRP in the SDP.

As others have noted, if you want to interoperage with 3GPP, its
specificaitons are available.
