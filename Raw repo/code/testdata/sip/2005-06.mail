=20
Here are my review comments. I apologize for the delay, but
unfortunately the document is not yet completely problems free, and it
generated some discussions 'in the doctors room':
=20
A few issues were found related to the definition of the
SipMethodIdentifier TC and its usage:
=20
1.  The way it is defined the TC encourages extensibility, and this can
be regarded as a good thing. In order to do this a vendor must invent
some numerical assignment, which is not yet used by the standard, and
the DESCRIPTION requires that this assignment "MUST ensure no collision
with officially assigned method identifier values" but says nothing
about how collision can be avoided. It would be useful to split the
identifiers numbers space into standard and experimental, and create a
second experimental registry where vendors building an extension method
and receive a number in the experimental space. This would ensure that
collisions are avoided, and experimental methods are identified at a
glance.
2. Another MIB Doctor asked 'why the method name has not been used as an
index as this would be the natural naming scheme. Having to go through a
lookup table (in case the SipMethodIdentifier has only local
significance) is painful and the alternative to establish another IANA
registry to number the SIP methods seems also kind of costly.'. I am not
sure that a change is necessary at this stage, as nothing is broken, but
as I would suggest that you provide a rationale for this design choice.=20
3. The TC misses a DISPLAY-HINT (probably "d"), which results into a
smilint warning=20
=20
Some more editorial things.=20
=20
4. Since the document was published the Intellectual Property
boilerplates were updated. See
http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt for the latest version
5. It is recommended that the module name of the SIP-TC module be
changed to SIP-TC-MIB
6. typo - DESCRIPTION clause of SipStatusCodeNotifTable - "seperate"
7. typo - DESCRIPTION clause of SipMethodIdentifier - "extention"
8. typo - DESCRIPTION clause of sipServiceNotifEnable - "approriate"
9. type - DESCRIPTION clause of sipServiceWarmStart - "adminstrative"
10. There are 129 instances of too long lines in this documents. Please
run idnits for the full list
http://ietf.levkowetz.com/tools/idnits/idnits.pyht
11. Warnings of weird spacing in lines=20

tmp/draft-ietf-sip-mib-09.txt(4789): Line has weird spacing: '...odTable

12. As Section 8 including the Log of Changes will be taken out, but
there are other sections after this section it would be better to move
it to an annex and renumber, making sure that proper references from the
text go to the intended place.

*No*, the Call-Id, From-tag, and CSeq are *not* enough to detect
retransmission -- you have to check the branch-parameter of the top Via as
well.  Otherwise, if you have received two forks of the same INVITE (say),
you will think they are duplicates, when they are not -- each must be
responded to separately.

This is the *single most common error* we have found when testing SIP
phones.  In ordinary office situations, it can cause inexplicable
difficulties for the users.

I did respond to Dean's e-mail of that date. I simply choose to do so 
privately, since there was no use carrying on a public e-mail discussion on an issue 
after he had stated such absolutes concerning what must be in the document, 
effectively cutting off any discussion.

Henning,

In fixing section 4.2 (by removing the former step 1 about ignoring the RPH
if there is no congestion), you have gone slightly too far the other way.

The way step 3 reads now, it sounds as if you "preempt or queue" every
time, even when there is no congestion.

Perhaps you could reword 3 as "If the request is authorized, and the
resources are available (no congestion), serve as usual.  If the request is
authorized, but resources are not available (congestion), either premept
other current sessions, or insert the request into a priority queue, as
described in 4.5."

Janet

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-09.txt

addresses the working group and IETF last-call comments, at least where
the authors and the commenter were in agreement (see the flood of
messages from the weekend). Hopefully, this update can speed up the
resolution of any remaining issues by avoiding discussion of items that
have been resolved already.

I would appreciate if astute readers could alert me to any omissions or
misunderstandings of comments offered.

Henning

Janet,

IP priority queueing occurs for these calls/sessions independent of
congestion status, unlike in circuit switched.

Good point; I'll change the wording.

Puneet Kalia:

I am not aware of any IETF spec that describes format of contents of=20
CDRs, I believe those are typically outside the scope of the IETF work.

I am aware, though, of work done in 3GPP, where the contents of CDRs are=20
standardized. You can take a look at 3GPP TS 32.260. Section 6.1.3 will=20
provide you a hint.

The spec is available at:
http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/32_series/32.260/32260-610.zip

BR,

You didn't respond to the above comment I submitted. I suspect it requires a 
little better explanation on my part.

Since this draft defines a new reason value, it must be assumed that it is 
based on, and follows everything in, RFC 3326. However, it doesn't make a clear 
statement that the syntax follows what is defined in RFC 3326.

As I read the syntax in Section 2 of RFC 3326, the reason header may contain 
multiple reason-values (e.g., both SIP and Q.850) and for each protocol may 
specify multiple reason-parameters (e.g., cause value and text), and each is 
optional. The syntax defined in Section 2 allows the use of a cause value without 
the accompanying text string, although the examples don't ever show that.

(However, the final paragraph of Section 2 of RFC 3326 implies that multiple 
protocols are indicated by the use on multiple headers - "multiple Reason 
lines" - not by putting multiple protocols into one header.)

This draft, on the other hand, contains statements like:

the following syntax shall be used:

         Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA Preemption"

This implies that the text part is mandatory.

It seems that part of the problem is the way that the syntax was defined in 
RFC 3326. While it implied that the text part is always used, the formal 
definition shows it as optional.

Concerning IANA registration, RFC 3326 only required the registration of the 
protocols (SIP and Q.950) since all cause values and text strings were defined 
elsewhere. This draft extends that model by requiring the registration of 
more than the new protocol ("preemption"). It implies that both cause values and 
text strings need to be registered, but this is not clear. Rather than 
containing more description of the procedures for use of these parameters, Section 7 
needs explicit statements about IANA registration requirements.

Because SIP and Q.850 have clearly defined meanings for their cause 
numbers, and this extension does not, I believe the text string should be 
maintained through IANA.

 From an IANA point of view, at 
http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters you can see the text string 
for each 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX and 6XX response code that would be used 
if the SIP protocol were used in a 3326 Reason header. As IANA is where to 
first look up these things, I'm not sure why you have an issue with IANA 
having the same text string explaining what each cause is in the Preemption 
protocol of the Reason header. If the text string were removed in the IANA 
registration, there would be no clue there what each cause number meant.

This is not the case right now at 
http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters for all other SIP parameters.

I believe one of your concerns is the user learning/reading the reason in 
the Reason header within your domain, and I believe that is a local 
configuration decision.

In the document, I do not believe I ever made it a MUST, SHOULD, 
RECOMMENDED or even a MAY be presented to the user of the UA who is being 
preempted. I believe this is up to the implementation and local policy to 
show, or not to show.

Yes, I think so too.

There is the same Call-ID, same from tag and CSeq number is the same. The UAS should be able to recognise that this is a retransmission and should send its last answer (200 OK).

As I commented, the text clearly indicates that the "UAC" (i.e., the physical 
device, not the human) may attempt a subsequent request. There should be no 
implication that it is permissable for the UAC to do this while text that says 
that a human user might do this is okay. It should describe only what the UAC 
"MAY" do in support of this. The current paragraph which says:

   Upon receiving a 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority) response, the UAC
   MAY attempt a subsequent request with the same or different resource
   value.  If available, it SHOULD choose authorized resource values
   from the set of values returned in the 'Accept-Resource-Priority'
   header field.

Should be changed to:

   Upon receiving a 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority) response, the UAC
   MAY display to the user a list of the authorized resource values returned 
in the 'Accept-Resource-Priority'
   header field. The user may then attempt a subsequent request with the same 
or different resource
   value.

Then it is clear that it is the human user, not the device, which is making 
the decision and attempting another call.

I guess I didn't explain my concern well enough. It isn't the issue of 
notifying the user of something they shouldn't know in our domain. The "Generic 
Preemption" was added to deal with this.

I have no problem with the (default) text string being registered with IANA 
for each defined preemption cause as was done for each SIP response code. The 
concern is that the IANA considerations section does not make it clear that 
this is what IANA is expected to do.

I don't understand why this is called the "default" text. It would seem that 
any device could put in any text string it wanted, for example, the same thing 
in another langauage. I believe RFC 3261 is rather vague on this issue. While 
the ABNF requires that a Reason-phrase be included in every message and it 
provides "default" text for each and includes it in the IANA registration, I 
don't believe it requires that this exact text string be used.

My comment is mostly that there appears to be a conflict between the text in 
this draft and the formal syntax definition in RFC 3326. I don't know which is 
correct. It would seem to me that, if this new preemption cause is used, that 
the numeric cause value is mandatory and the text string is optional. Neither 
RFC 3326 nor this draft says that. The formal definition in RFC 3326 says 
both are optional. This draft indicates that both are required.

I guess I didn't explain my concern well enough. It isn't the issue of notif=
ying the user of something they shouldn't know in our domain. The "Generic P=
reemption" was added to deal with this.<BR>
<BR>
I have no problem with the (default) text string being registered with IANA=20=
for each defined preemption cause as was done for each SIP response code. Th=
e concern is that the IANA considerations section does not make it clear tha=
t this is what IANA is expected to do.<BR>
<BR>
I don't understand why this is called the "default" text. It would seem that=
 any device could put in any text string it wanted, for example, the same th=
ing in another langauage. I believe RFC 3261 is rather vague on this issue.=20=
While the ABNF requires that a Reason-phrase be included in every message an=
d it provides "default" text for each and includes it in the IANA registrati=
on, I don't believe it requires that this exact text string be used.<BR>
<BR>
My comment is mostly that there appears to be a conflict between the text in=
 this draft and the formal syntax definition in RFC 3326. I don't know which=
 is correct. It would seem to me that, if this new preemption cause is used,=
 that the numeric cause value is mandatory and the text string is optional.=20=
Neither RFC 3326 nor this draft says that. The formal definition in RFC 3326=
 says both are optional. This draft indicates that both are required.<BR>

This is significantly worse, and treads pretty directly into the

I strongly prefer the existing text and frankly don't see what the

I'm obviously with David here.

In general, my philosophy is that we should stick, to the extent  
possible, with observable behavior. If an external observer can't  
tell if a human or a robot made the decision to call again, it seems  
futile to try to have the protocol spec mandate human intervention. I  
understand the need to preserve a place for humans in the world, but  
protocol specs are probably the wrong place to prevent human-to-robot  
outsourcing. (Similarities to the Turing test are noted.)

I suspect a better place for this is a requisition document that  
describes how a device should indicate failures and how a user (or  
robot) is allowed to act on these.

Henning

In that case, the UA should be making the request at the priority level that
policy sets for that robot.  (If there is no resource shortage, submitting a
request at a high priority has the same effect as submitting it at a low
priority.  If there is a resource shortage, submitting it at a low priority
first is a duplication of effort.  Like in a "Vickrey auction", the optimal
behavior is to submit your first request with the highest priority you're
willing to request.)

> I strongly prefer the existing text and frankly don't see what the

On one hand, as Henning says, this isn't really a protocol question.  On the
other hand, what one says in the protocol documents does influence how
people implement the agents that perform the protocol.  From a protocol
point of view, it is OK to say "If a request is rejected due to inadequate
priority, it is acceptable for the UA to submit it again at a higher
priority".  But in practice, these words will cause some idiot to write a UA
that will automatically rachet a request from "routine" to "priority" and
all the way up to "strategic nuclear attack notice" until it gets accepted.

In think that within the human context of this document, we really want to
have some wording that makes it clear that a UA is not allowed to upgrade a
request "on its own", but only under the direction of a user or an
administrative policy.  But most of the time, that should only happen
because a user normally omits to specify the priority of a high-priority
message because normally there is no resource shortage, and it saves dialing
effort.

Dale

I sympathize with your concern, but there is no assurance that human
discipline (following an organizational policy) will avoid racheting
up the requests.  Systems like AUTODIN, GTPS, etc. were specifically
engineered to take that ability out of the user's hands.  hopefully,
we can do better than those systems in the future.

security credentials, non-user-manipulated distributed policy, and
RFPs are the avenues that will address your concern -- all being 
outside whether new attempts are automated or a function of user
decision.

I'm with Dave and Henning in leaving the text as is.

Whether or not additions to namespaces are allowed, there must still be the 
same complexity of defining how unknown priority values are handled.

Yes, adding a priority value could cause problems, but that is the concern of 
the organization using that namespace. There can not be an RFC that says the 
US Defense Department can't ever add a 6th precedence level to its DSN. No one 
else should care. (Remember that a 6th level was added to the DRSN somewhat 
recently.)

It doesn't say that, I don't think. It says that since the DSN  
namespace is registered with IANA and it has certain properties, If  
those properties change the IANA registration either has to change,  
or at least some IETF-sanctioned expert review should determine if  
the change is safe. Seems perfectly appropriate and such language is  
used for all sorts of IANA registrations by non-IETF groups. There's  
nothing special about the U.S. DoD in that sense.

An implementer building a product engineered to work with multiple  
namespaces MIGHT care, depending on the nature of the change.

If we're talking about an automated UA (for example, the=20

(instead of a human user) from making this decision? Is there something=20=

about resource-priority that prevents it from being applicable to=20

We can write the protocol spec perfectly that can still result in an idiot 
coding it incorrectly. Specs don't prevent this idiocy from occurring

I think I now understand your original comment differently

yes

fair point - and one I have asked our chair to clarify for the revision of 
this document.


>I don't understand why this is called the "default" text.

well... because the text string is optional, and the text can be something 
other than the exact string listed as the default in this document.

>It would seem that any device could put in any text string it wanted, for 
>example, the same thing in another langauage.

yes, but this is guidance - ala "if you use a text string, we recommend 
this one for consistency"

nope it doesn't, you're right, and that is why the word "default" is used 
for guidance reasons. The doc specifies the exact reason for each code, but 
the string can be some variant. I can give more explanation in that part of 
the document to this affect.

I attempted to take the 3326 text a bit further without overstepping the 
gist of the RFC.

>It would seem to me that, if this new preemption cause is used, that the 
>numeric cause value is mandatory and the text string is optional.

yes, as long as the new cause code act exactly as is specified in that 
extension RFC, and there is a default text string to give *some* guidance 
(which can be omitted or changed per domain).

>Neither RFC 3326 nor this draft says that. The formal definition in RFC 
>3326 says both are optional. This draft indicates that both are required.

I didn't mean to imply the text string is required - I would have used 
SHALL if I meant that. I apologize for the mixed meaning there.

I will clarify that the text string is optional in the document, but a 
guidance/default string is needed for IANA registration. I will add that 
this string can be something other than the exact string given in the doc 
per cause value. Is this agreeable?

A new Request for Comments is now available in online RFC libraries.


        RFC 4092

        Title:      Usage of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
                    Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics
                    in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
        Author(s):  G. Camarillo, J. Rosenberg
        Status:     Standards Track
        Date:       June 2005
        Mailbox:    Gonzalo.Camarillo@ericsson.com, jdrosen@cisco.com
        Pages:      6
        Characters: 12624

        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-anat-usage-00.txt

        URL:        ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4092.txt


This document describes how to use the Alternative Network Address
Types (ANAT) semantics of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
grouping framework in SIP.  In particular, we define the sdp-anat
SIP option-tag.  This SIP option-tag ensures that SDP session
descriptions that use ANAT are only handled by SIP entities with ANAT
support.  To justify the need for such a SIP option-tag, we describe
what could possibly happen if an ANAT-unaware SIP entity tried to
handle media lines grouped with ANAT.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG with the message body 
help: ways_to_get_rfcs.  For example:

        To: rfc-info@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
        Subject: getting rfcs

        help: ways_to_get_rfcs

Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the
author of the RFC in question, or to RFC-Manager@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Unless
specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for
unlimited distribution.

Submissions for Requests for Comments should be sent to
RFC-EDITOR@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.  Please consult RFC 2223, Instructions to RFC
Authors, for further information.

In every use of this capability, the first session setup attempt must use the 
correct namespace and priority level for the attempted session. There is 
never a need for the UA to try again with different values when the first attempt 
fails. It could retry with the same values (like an auto redial on a FAX 
machine).

I thought I had explained the problem with the current text sufficiently. 
Obviously, if a blind person using a terminal, the reference above to "display" 
is understood to mean some means appropriate to a blind person.
I don't think we're concerned with "robots". If you mean a software 
application, etc. resident in the same physical device as the UA, then my description 
of the problem remains. All session setup attempts must use the correct 
namespace/priority the first time. There is no case in which a device can decide to 
use a different value if the first attempt fails.

If it helps. the word human can be left out of my suggested text above.

Hi,

I'm looking into ways to distribute general context information, and=20
have some questions connected to SIP Events.

SIMPLE is used to transport presence information to a watcher. In the=20
introduction of RFC 3856 it is argued why SIP Events is an appropriate=20
way to distribute presence information. I agree in the arguments given=20
in the RFC, but there are some details that still is not clear to me.=20
Presence status is a special kind of the more general Context=20
Information. What I'm uncertain about, is whether SIP Events should be=20
used for distribution of other kinds of context information as well?=20
Arguments that support this approach is that it is convenient to have=20
only one protocol taking care of distributing all sorts of context=20
information (e.g. Temperature, Light level, geographical location and so=20
on). Also, the arguements given why SIP Events is a proper way for=20
presence info distribution goes for many of the other kinds of context=20
information. Technically speaking, it is not any problem using SIP=20
Events for this matter, what I belive is the problem is that this=20
approach is in conflict with the "Guidelines for Authors of Extensions=20
to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" internet draft=20
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-guidelines-09.txt).=20
Section 3.1 defines SIPs solution space, and I have a hard time=20
convincing myself that distribution of general context information is=20
within the solution space of SIP, in other words SIP is not an=20
appropriate protocol. Then again, it seems kind of strange to me to=20
define one protocol per each kind of context information type. (e.g. one=20
for geographical location, one for temperature and so on). Should SIP=20
Events  be used to distribute all kinds of context information (i.e.=20
breaking the sip guidelines draft)? Should presence be distributed by=20
SIMPLE, and other kinds of context information distributed by other=20
protocols, i.e. creating a great number of context distribution=20
protocols? Or should a general protocol for context information be=20
designed, taking care of all sorts of context information including=20
presence status, i.e.dropping SIMPLE?

Any comments helping to clarify this matter is highly appreciated!

Cheers,
Egil C. =D8sthus

I would think the question is the context of the context information, so =
to
speak.  If the purpose is to present, display, or distribute information
about one person/agent so that another person/agent can decide whether it
wants to communicate with the first one, then it would seem to be reasona=
ble
to use SIP events to distribute it.

Dale

Hi Dale and Egil:

Yes, you are right.

We have taken the similar approach to monitor device status and
learn about about device context information in our draft: A Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Device Information
(http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-rahman-sipping-device-info/).
A revised version will be submitted to sipping group in a few days.

We have used a event package mechanism (device-info) in the above draft,
however during presentation of the draft to Sipping group in IETF in
Washington
DC, we  mentioned in the future we will introduce the idea of device
presence to
learn the device status and the context in future revision of the draft.


regards,

--brijesh

I plan to revert to SHOULD NOT unless somebody raises issues that  
force a MUST NOT. I think such addition is sufficiently unlikely that  
we cannot anticipate the concrete cases that may or may not arise and  
their issues. The review process required for registration would then  
be able to illuminate any interoperability problems.

I totally agree about this, but I belive that context information could=20
be used to other applications than those of (human) communication.=20
Examples could be various tourist guides (using geograhical location for=20

using SIP, on the other hand in certain cases SIP applications could=20
benefint for using location information (for instance a intelligent=20

Should the same information (in this case the geographical location) be=20
carried by to different protocols (requiring two or more implemented=20
protocol stacks at the sensor), or should the same protocol be used=20
(i.e. should each application use a context protocol in addition to=20
other needed protocols)?

Jon, Cullen,
 
in section 7 the response code 428 is used with two different meanings:
 
428 'Use Identity Header' - this is in line with section 15.2, IANA
considerations;
 
but 'step 3' in section 7 says
 
... then a 428 'Invalid Identity Header' response MUST be ...

 

I assume "428" is a typo in the latter case, but a response 'Invalid
Identity Header' is not defined anywhere else in the document. 

 

Can you please clarify?

 

 

Thanks

Hi,

SIP Parameters at IANA for session timers in SIP (RFC4028) are still registered
with "RFC-ietf-sip-session-timer-15.txt". Could you update it? It will be
easier to see the parameters related to drafts.

Thanks!

Ok, so are we concluding that the text is okay as written, or does it 
need the change Cullen suggested?

C'mon folks, OMA wants to use this draft. We need to close it up, one 
way or another.

It seems like a very common case people want to use this is for click to
dial and in that case, there is no previous signaling.

So far, to my knowledge, no one has provided an argument of how the require
helps in any case. It will reduce interoperability between clients that do
and do not support this. Unless someone has an argument why the require is
needed, I think we should drop it.

(And if using the require on call flows with correctly behaving OMA
endpoints somehow reduced the bandwidth, I'd view that as a reason but so
far no one has provided an example of this)

Why we are reopening this never ending discussion again?
Below is the precise recap of the achieved "compromise" that worked for
everyone back in the last IETF:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Topic: REFER Extensions=20
by Orit Levin=20
see draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-01.txt=20
Slides were presented that should be included in proceedings.=20

Only one open issue remained for the draft since its WGLC. This was=20
"How does a REFER-Issuer enable the feature?". Alternatives include:=20
a) Commonly preceded by OPTIONS, b) supported header in the request,=20
c) required header in the response, d) require header in the request.=20

Discussion agreed that the Supported header is the wrong approach, as=20
it indicates which features are supported by the sender, not required=20
for the respondent.=20

Discussion became prolonged, and the participants were moved to the=20
hallway for a focused discussion. This discussion reached the=20
following conclusion:=20

  1) Add a new header to be used with REFER request and the=20
      corresponding response
  2) Keep option tag=20
  3) Including this option tag in Require header is NOT RECOMMENDED.=20

This conclusion was shared with the WG, and no objections were noted.=20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does anyone think that we need to rehash it again? If we are in
agreement, I will revise the draft accordingly and re-submit it ASAP.
Otherwise, lets continue the discussion...

Thanks,
Orit.

I'm in 100% agreement with Orit - sounds good to me.

have a consensus, send it to the IESG for review.

Since it is a new Dialog creation request, there is no question of it matching any dialog. So ideally you should not get 481 for a new SUBSCRIBE initiated with a brand new call id and
from tag. You can get this response usually for (RE)SUBSCRIBE or NOTIFY.

The IESG has approved the following documents:

- 'Actions addressing identified issues with the Session Initiation Protocol's 
   non-INVITE Transaction '
   <draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions-03.txt> as a Proposed Standard
- 'Problems identified associated with the Session Initiation Protocol's 
   non-INVITE Transaction '
   <draft-sparks-sip-nit-problems-02.txt> as an Informational RFC

These documents are products of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Allison Mankin and Jon Peterson.

Technical Summary

   draft-sparks-sip-nit-problems is an informational description of
   the problems that arise in SIP because the protocol design for
   non-INVITE transactions (message exchanges other than the
   initiation handshake that begins with INVITE) were designed with 
   timing rules which have turned out to cause race conditions, 
   useless traffic and potential storms.  A security issue is
   identified in that these problems could even be exploited by
   a malicious actor.

   draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions describes the solutions for the
   problems described in the companion document.

   These solutions motivate several modifications in normative processing
   in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), in RFC 3261, and they
   are shown to address the problems identified with the SIP
   non-INVITE transaction.  These modifications reduce the probability
   of messages losing the race condition inherent in the non-INVITE
   transaction and reduce useless network traffic.  They also improve
   the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding. 
  
   draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions updates RFC 3261.
 
 Working Group Summary
 
  It was very difficult for the SIP Working Group to come to consensus on
  the scope of problems with non-INVITE transactions.  Demonstrating
  and narrowing the problem statement required a very careful set of consensus
  discussions related to the differences in perspective of the participants,
  and the difficulty of obtaining a completely clear statement of complex
  issues.  The consensus once won resulted in clear solutions, and both
  documents were forwarded for advancement with strong consensus.
 
Protocol Quality
 
 The initiation of this work was due to the editor's activities with
 implementations in SIP interoperability events.  He has stated that the 
 problem statement and solutions are both implementation-based.

The Responsible Area Director for the documents is Allison Mankin.  
The Working Group Shepherd for these documents is Rohan Mahy.

Notes to the RFC Editor
 
Replace the Security Considerations Section  text of 
draft-ietf-sip-nit-problems-02.txt with:

   This document describes some problems in the core SIP
   specification [1] related to the SIP non-INVITE, the messages other
   than the INVITE handshake that begins transactions.  A few of
   the problems lead to flooding or forgery risk, and could possibly be
   exploited by an adversary in a denial of service attack.  Solutions are
   defined in the companion draft-sip-nit-action-03.txt [RFC Editor - 
   replace this with the corresponding RFC number].
   
   One solution there prohibits proxies and User Agents from sending 408
   responses to non-INVITE transactions.  Without this change, proxies
   automatically generate a storm of useless responses.
   An attacker could capitalize on this by enticing User Agents to
   send non-INVITE requests to a black hole (through social engineering
   or DNS poisoning) or by selectively dropping responses.

   Another solution prohibits proxies from forwarding late responses.
   Without this change, an attacker could easily forge messages which
   appear to be late responses.  All proxies compliant with RFC 3261 are
   required to forward these responses, wasting bandwidth and CPU and
   potentially overwhelming target User Agents (especially those with
   low speed connections).

Please change the name of the References sections in draft-sparks-nit-problems

Yes, you should never see a 481 for an initial request.

However, in the interests of being strict on what you send and liberal 
on what you receive, I would advise against an implementation getting 
particularly upset at the receipt of a 481 to a dialog-initiating 
request; it should be treated as any other 4xx response in such a case.

Subject: Re: [Sip] querry about 481

Yes, you should never see a 481 for an initial request.

However, in the interests of being strict on what you send and liberal
on what you receive, I would advise against an implementation getting
particularly upset at the receipt of a 481 to a dialog-initiating
request; it should be treated as any other 4xx response in such a case.

RFC 3261 specifies that a dialog is identified by a local tag, a remote 
tag 
and a call identifier, each of which should be "globally unique". The 
sender
of an INVITE adds both the Call-ID and the local tag. The recipients of 
that
INVITE each add their own remote tag (the To tag) to their responses. 

It is clear that the remote tag is necessary to be able to distinguish the
responses from the different recipients. However, there is no obvious need 

for the From tag: the INVITE already contains a unique Call-ID. 

So why is the From tag needed?

Cheers,

Frank

Hi Stuart,

I don't quite see how this would work. The Via header is there to route 
a response and the Route header is there to route a request, in both 
cases based on their own contents and not based on the contents of the 
>From and To headers respectively. 

Could you elaborate on what you have in mind?

Cheers,

Frank

Hi Rob,

The fact that the callee uses the same Call-ID is sufficient information 
to 
have the caller decide that this is a request on the same call. If you are
inferring that the Call-ID, although it is supposed to be unique, does not
provide this information, it is equally true that the From tag does not
provide this either. 

However, I do see a point. The fact that a From tag is present, does 
provide
an indication that this is a request on an exisisting dialog. It does, 
however,
raise the issue about the uniqueness of the To tag, the From tag and the 
Call-ID.

What you're saying is that the Call-ID cannot be trusted to be unique and 
that
another, again probably not so unique, parameter is added to determine 
whether 
or not a request belongs to an existing dialog.

Cheers,

Frank

I'm not saying the Call-Id can't be trusted to be unique, although it's =
certainly possible (although unlikely) that it might not be unique.  I'm =
saying, having the From and To tag both help determine direction of a =
call and provide additional guarantees to the uniqueness of the call.

Let me give you another thought:

-Caller-     -Proxy-      -Callee-
INVITE ------------------>
CallId=3Dx
From-Tag=3D
To-Tag=3D
       <----------------- 200 OK
                          CallId=3Dx
                          From-Tag=3D
                          To-Tag=3Dy
ACK    ------------------>
CallId=3Dx
From-Tag=3D
To-Tag=3Dy
       <----------------- INVITE
                          CallId=3Dx
                          From-Tag=3D
                          To-Tag=3D

Now the initial INVITE from the caller and the reINVITE from the callee =
look the same.  Suppose your proxy was a parallel forking B2BUA proxy =
who sent the INVITE in several different directions.  You got the 200 OK =
from the callee and ACK from the caller, but it may be that at some =
point after that, one of those other forks comes back though you again =
(on it's way to a destination on the other side of you).  Now how can =
you tell the difference between that forked INVITE and a reINVITE from =
the callee?  You can't, so you have to allow it through.  If, however, =
you had both a known To and From tag, and then you get an INVITE that =
just has a From tag, you instantly know it's not allowed and can return =
an error accordingly.

In the end, what does sending a From tag hurt, anyway?  After this flow =
completes, you would get:

200 OK ------------------>
CallId=3Dx
From-Tag=3D
To-Tag=3Dz
       <----------------- ACK
                          CallId=3Dx
                          From-Tag=3D
                          To-Tag=3Dz

anyway, and doesn't that just end up specifying a From and To tag?  But =
by specifying the From and To tag up front, it's easier to follow the =
flow from the beginning (in terms of INVITE vs. re-INVITE and caller vs. =
callee).

If you send an INVITE with a Replaces header, but the dialog info in the
Replaces header matches no dialog at the target UA, it should respond with
481.

But in general, your system should be able to cope with any response code
from a request, as you never know what new behavior will be defined for
various new request types.

Rob,

Since the second INVITE does not contain any tags, it does not have the 
same dialog ID as the already existing dialog! The first dialog has a 
dialog ID that consists of an empty From tag, a Call-ID with the value x 
and a To tag with the value y. The second invite will, at the worst, have 
an identical Call-ID and empty From and To tags. So there's no match.

I agree that including a From tag doesn't hurt a bit and we could argue 
about it being an "elegant" to do the same thing for both directions. 
However,I am just trying to understand why it would be necessary, because 
the RFC does not give an explanation for this tag (it does have one for 
the To tag).

Am I missing something in your example?

Cheers,

Frank

RE: [Sip] The logic behind the From tag?

I'm not saying the Call-Id can't be trusted to be unique, although it's 
certainly possible (although unlikely) that it might not be unique.  I'm 
saying, having the From and To tag both help determine direction of a call 
and provide additional guarantees to the uniqueness of the call.

Let me give you another thought:

-Caller-     -Proxy-      -Callee-
INVITE ------------------>
CallId=x
From-Tag=
To-Tag=
       <----------------- 200 OK
                          CallId=x
                          From-Tag=
                          To-Tag=y
ACK    ------------------>
CallId=x
From-Tag=
To-Tag=y
       <----------------- INVITE
                          CallId=x
                          From-Tag=
                          To-Tag=

Now the initial INVITE from the caller and the reINVITE from the callee 
look the same.  Suppose your proxy was a parallel forking B2BUA proxy who 
sent the INVITE in several different directions.  You got the 200 OK from 
the callee and ACK from the caller, but it may be that at some point after 
that, one of those other forks comes back though you again (on it's way to 
a destination on the other side of you).  Now how can you tell the 
difference between that forked INVITE and a reINVITE from the callee?  You 
can't, so you have to allow it through.  If, however, you had both a known 
To and From tag, and then you get an INVITE that just has a From tag, you 
instantly know it's not allowed and can return an error accordingly.

In the end, what does sending a From tag hurt, anyway?  After this flow 
completes, you would get:

200 OK ------------------>
CallId=x
From-Tag=
To-Tag=z
       <----------------- ACK
                          CallId=x
                          From-Tag=
                          To-Tag=z

anyway, and doesn't that just end up specifying a From and To tag?  But by 
specifying the From and To tag up front, it's easier to follow the flow 
from the beginning (in terms of INVITE vs. re-INVITE and caller vs. 
callee).

Hi Rob,

The fact that the callee uses the same Call-ID is sufficient information 
to 
have the caller decide that this is a request on the same call. If you are
inferring that the Call-ID, although it is supposed to be unique, does not
provide this information, it is equally true that the From tag does not
provide this either. 

However, I do see a point. The fact that a From tag is present, does 
provide
an indication that this is a request on an exisisting dialog. It does, 
however,
raise the issue about the uniqueness of the To tag, the From tag and the 
Call-ID.

What you're saying is that the Call-ID cannot be trusted to be unique and 
that
another, again probably not so unique, parameter is added to determine 
whether 
or not a request belongs to an existing dialog.

Cheers,

Frank

Actually, I'd say the From tag is there to determine the direction of a 
call and it's validity.

Consider if you had no From tag: you send out an initial INVITE with no 
>From and no To tag but with a unique call-ID.  No problem so far.  The 
callee receives the call and inserts it's To tag in the response.  Again, 
no problem.

Now the callee wants to put the call on hold.  OK, so it now swaps From 
and To to generate the request (so you can tell it's generated from the 
callee and not the caller)...but there's no From tag.  The call-ID is the 
same, but it looks like a new request: no From tag, no To tag.

The original caller gets this request and ... what is he supposed to do 
with it?  Is it a re-INVITE?  A separate call?  What if was a non-INVITE 
request?  You don't know how to handle it because you don't have the 
To/From tag combination to tell you what is going on.

In 2003 an I-D about SIP-B was published. Although new references to 
SIP-B keep popping up, there is no visible activity on this subject.

Whatever happened to this initiative?

Consider if you had no From tag: you send out an initial INVITE with no=20

no problem.

Now the callee wants to put the call on hold.  OK, so it now swaps From=20

the=20
same, but it looks like a new request: no From tag, no To tag.

The original caller gets this request and ... what is he supposed to do=20

Hi Rob,

I don't know if you saw the response from ""Bala Neelakantan", who refers 
to 
the following expired draft RFC:

http://www.softarmor.com/wgdb/docs/draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-06.txt

Section 7.1 gives one possible reason why the From tag would be required. 

In your new example I see two things that I do not quite understand:

1) Why would the proxy send an INVITE with no To-tag on the same Call-ID?
   This suggests that some party "behind" the proxy happens to have picked
   an identical Call-ID to establish a call to the Caller.
2) Why doesn't the callee add the To-tag in the INVITE to the caller?
   It was already clear that the To-tag makes sense, so I do not see why
   the callee adds it to the 200 OK, but doesn't add it to the re-INVITE.
   In your example it is not possible to distinguish between the INVITE
   from the Proxy and the Callee because the To-tag is left empty. They
   must be present and have unique and different values.

Cheers,

Frank

Rob,

Since the second INVITE does not contain any tags, it does not have the 
same dialog ID as the already existing dialog! The first dialog has a 
dialog ID that consists of an empty From tag, a Call-ID with the value x 
and a To tag with the value y. The second invite will, at the worst, have 
an identical Call-ID and empty From and To tags. So there's no match.

I agree that including a From tag doesn't hurt a bit and we could argue 
about it being an "elegant" to do the same thing for both directions. 
However,I am just trying to understand why it would be necessary, because 
the RFC does not give an explanation for this tag (it does have one for 
the To tag).

Am I missing something in your example?

Cheers,

Frank

RE: [Sip] The logic behind the From tag?

I'm not saying the Call-Id can't be trusted to be unique, although it's 
certainly possible (although unlikely) that it might not be unique.  I'm 
saying, having the From and To tag both help determine direction of a call 

and provide additional guarantees to the uniqueness of the call.

Let me give you another thought:

-Caller-     -Proxy-      -Callee-
INVITE ------------------>
CallId=x
From-Tag=
To-Tag=
       <----------------- 200 OK
                          CallId=x
                          From-Tag=
                          To-Tag=y
ACK    ------------------>
CallId=x
From-Tag=
To-Tag=y
       <----------------- INVITE
                          CallId=x
                          From-Tag=
                          To-Tag=

Now the initial INVITE from the caller and the reINVITE from the callee 
look the same.  Suppose your proxy was a parallel forking B2BUA proxy who 
sent the INVITE in several different directions.  You got the 200 OK from 
the callee and ACK from the caller, but it may be that at some point after 

that, one of those other forks comes back though you again (on it's way to 

a destination on the other side of you).  Now how can you tell the 
difference between that forked INVITE and a reINVITE from the callee?  You 

can't, so you have to allow it through.  If, however, you had both a known 

To and From tag, and then you get an INVITE that just has a From tag, you 
instantly know it's not allowed and can return an error accordingly.

In the end, what does sending a From tag hurt, anyway?  After this flow 
completes, you would get:

200 OK ------------------>
CallId=x
From-Tag=
To-Tag=z
       <----------------- ACK
                          CallId=x
                          From-Tag=
                          To-Tag=z

anyway, and doesn't that just end up specifying a From and To tag?  But by 

specifying the From and To tag up front, it's easier to follow the flow 
from the beginning (in terms of INVITE vs. re-INVITE and caller vs. 
callee).

The callee doesn't add the To-tag, because when the callee sends the =
message, he is now the From, not the To, and you have to swap To and =
>From accordingly.  Since the assertion is we don't have From tags, we =
can't send the original To tag (from the 200 OK response) in the From =
tag.  Voila, no tags.

The reason the proxy sent the INVITE with the same call-ID is because =
it's just the forked request from the original INVITE.  The timing of =
the message (mabye it went through several proxies along the way, you =
don't know for sure) just made it come back through our forking proxy =
again after we had already received a final response.

RE: [Sip] The logic behind the From tag?

Apparently my description wasn't that clear.  Lemme draw it out:

-Caller-     -Proxy-      -Callee-      -Proxy-

             --------------------------->

       <----------------- 200 OK

Now how did you tell the difference between the INVITE from the callee =

Rob,

Since the second INVITE does not contain any tags, it does not have the=20
same dialog ID as the already existing dialog! The first dialog has a=20
dialog ID that consists of an empty From tag, a Call-ID with the value x =

and a To tag with the value y. The second invite will, at the worst, =
have=20
an identical Call-ID and empty From and To tags. So there's no match.

I agree that including a From tag doesn't hurt a bit and we could argue=20
about it being an "elegant" to do the same thing for both directions.=20
However,I am just trying to understand why it would be necessary, =
because=20
the RFC does not give an explanation for this tag (it does have one for=20
the To tag).

Am I missing something in your example?

Cheers,

Frank

I'm not saying the Call-Id can't be trusted to be unique, although it's=20
certainly possible (although unlikely) that it might not be unique.  I'm =

saying, having the From and To tag both help determine direction of a =
call=20

and provide additional guarantees to the uniqueness of the call.

Let me give you another thought:

-Caller-     -Proxy-      -Callee-
INVITE ------------------>
CallId=3Dx
From-Tag=3D
To-Tag=3D
       <----------------- 200 OK
                          CallId=3Dx
                          From-Tag=3D
                          To-Tag=3Dy
ACK    ------------------>
CallId=3Dx
From-Tag=3D
To-Tag=3Dy
       <----------------- INVITE
                          CallId=3Dx
                          From-Tag=3D
                          To-Tag=3D

Now the initial INVITE from the caller and the reINVITE from the callee=20
look the same.  Suppose your proxy was a parallel forking B2BUA proxy =
who=20
sent the INVITE in several different directions.  You got the 200 OK =
from=20
the callee and ACK from the caller, but it may be that at some point =
after=20

that, one of those other forks comes back though you again (on it's way =
to=20

a destination on the other side of you).  Now how can you tell the=20
difference between that forked INVITE and a reINVITE from the callee?  =
You=20

can't, so you have to allow it through.  If, however, you had both a =
known=20

To and From tag, and then you get an INVITE that just has a From tag, =
you=20
instantly know it's not allowed and can return an error accordingly.

In the end, what does sending a From tag hurt, anyway?  After this flow=20
completes, you would get:

200 OK ------------------>
CallId=3Dx
From-Tag=3D
To-Tag=3Dz
       <----------------- ACK
                          CallId=3Dx
                          From-Tag=3D
                          To-Tag=3Dz

anyway, and doesn't that just end up specifying a From and To tag?  But =
by=20

specifying the From and To tag up front, it's easier to follow the flow=20
from the beginning (in terms of INVITE vs. re-INVITE and caller vs.=20
callee).

Hi Rob,

The fact that the callee uses the same Call-ID is sufficient information =

to=20
have the caller decide that this is a request on the same call. If you =
are
inferring that the Call-ID, although it is supposed to be unique, does =

provide this information, it is equally true that the From tag does not
provide this either.=20

However, I do see a point. The fact that a From tag is present, does=20
provide
an indication that this is a request on an exisisting dialog. It does,=20
however,
raise the issue about the uniqueness of the To tag, the From tag and the =

Call-ID.

What you're saying is that the Call-ID cannot be trusted to be unique =
and=20
that
another, again probably not so unique, parameter is added to determine=20
whether=20
or not a request belongs to an existing dialog.

Actually, I'd say the From tag is there to determine the direction of a=20
call and it's validity.

Consider if you had no From tag: you send out an initial INVITE with no=20
>From and no To tag but with a unique call-ID.  No problem so far.  The=20
callee receives the call and inserts it's To tag in the response.  =
Again,=20
no problem.

Now the callee wants to put the call on hold.  OK, so it now swaps From=20
and To to generate the request (so you can tell it's generated from the=20
callee and not the caller)...but there's no From tag.  The call-ID is =
the=20
same, but it looks like a new request: no From tag, no To tag.

The original caller gets this request and ... what is he supposed to do=20
with it?  Is it a re-INVITE?  A separate call?  What if was a non-INVITE =

request?  You don't know how to handle it because you don't have the=20
To/From tag combination to tell you what is going on.

Drafts normally expire and get removed from the i-d directory when an RFC is approved.

Please refer to RFC 4028 if you wish to address thus discussion, and given that session-timer reached -15 before being approved as this RFC, it might me wise to ensure that the discussion point still applies after such a large number of revisions.

Keith,

I agree that it is not good practice to refer to expired Internet Drafts, 
however, in this case this was necessary because that draft contains 
information that is no longer present in the RFC!

Cheers,

Frank

Drafts normally expire and get removed from the i-d directory when an RFC 
is approved.

Please refer to RFC 4028 if you wish to address thus discussion, and given 
that session-timer reached -15 before being approved as this RFC, it might 
me wise to ensure that the discussion point still applies after such a 
large number of revisions.

SIP-B is a collection of features and techniques, so there may be no unique
answer.  That being said, sipX implements "call pick-up" according to the
SIP-B method (which is a straightforward application of SIP techniques).

Drage,

Yes, I agree that draft should not be referred.  Sorry.  But the
original poster was asking about the reason behind it.  I searched the
SIP mailing list for reference and came across the reference.  The
reference for the logic behind the "from" tag has been removed from the
later drats and RFC.  Also I remember some explanation given about from
Tag in the rfc2543bis.

Thanks,
Neel

Drafts normally expire and get removed from the i-d directory when an
RFC is approved.

Please refer to RFC 4028 if you wish to address thus discussion, and
given that session-timer reached -15 before being approved as this RFC,
it might me wise to ensure that the discussion point still applies after
such a large number of revisions.

----- Reposting on sip as suggested


The SIP RFC says that 

"A proxy has the option of canceling a transaction when there is a gap
of 3 minutes between responses in a transaction.  To prevent
cancellation, the UAS MUST send a non-100 provisional response at every
minute, to handle the possibility of lost provisional responses"

Assume a B2BUA has generated a request on behalf of a caller. When the
callee responds with a 180 Ringing message (with SDP) the B2BUA
negotiates the callee to the caller (who might be connected to a media
server, for example) so that a Ring back tone can be played or an IVR
session ensues. 

My queries are as follows

1) RFC 3262 states that reliable provisional responses are to be
retransmitted every two and a half minutes. Why is this really required
since the response is after all "reliable" !

2) Should the retransmitted provisional response always contain the same
SDP? i.e. Should I only consider the first SDP and ignore SDP's in
subsequent messages?

Any help is appreciated.

Because in addition to being reliable, they're still "provisional", and 
we need a state recovery mechanism to deal with state recovery in the 
cases where a transaction fails after a reliable provisional is 
exchanged.

Well, it would be terribly rude to change your offer in midstream, as 
there is a race conditional where an answer might be "in flight" as the 
new offer is being transmitted, so if the repsonse in question 
contained SDP, repeats should contain the same.

It's not clear to me that one actually has to repeat the SAME 
reliable-provisional response sequence in order to maintain the 
transaction in the final-pending state. It would seem to suffice to 
send another reliable provisional (perhaps a 180) without SDP.

Others may think differently.


Question: Shouldn't this really be on the sip-implementors list?

Hi,

Do you have a concrete proposal to realize what you are suggesting?

I will fix it.

Hi,

Section 17.2.1 of RFC 3261 says 

"For unreliable transports,  timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is 
not set to fire for
   reliable transports"

However Table A Table of Timer Values says

Timer G  initially T1     Section 17.2.1       INVITE response
                                               retransmit interval

Table A does not qualify this timer with "For UDP only" which it does for 
other timers like Timer A and Timer E in the same table.

Therefore I looks like that table A contradicts what is said in section 
17.2.1

Regards,

Rajeev

Hi,

I wonder if someone could point me to a definition of private headers, and
their prescribed use. I refer to the headers described e.g. in RFCs 3325 &
3455.

Thanks,

Hume

Thoughts about GRUUs.

After trying to straighten out the problems that we've been having
interpreting and using the contents of dialog event packages, it seems
that the only workable solution is for the contact addresses in
dialogs to be GRUUs -- globally routable URIs that are specific to one
UA.  At first, the "globally routable" constraint seems difficult if
not impossible to satisfy, but of necessity, every registrar/proxy has
already solved it.  draft-ietf-sip-gruu-03 is a good mechanism for
allowing UAs to piggyback off their registrar/proxies to solve the
problem generally.

Within the solution provided by draft-ietf-sip-gruu-03, I have a few
observations and suggestions:

- a way to solve the routing problem discussed in section 8.4.2
- a way to allow UAs without AORs to obtain GRUUs
- how to issue GRUUs when a UA has more than one contact address for a
  given AOR.
- an editorial comment about the syntax of URNs


* Routing problem.

Section 8.4.2 of draft-ietf-sip-gruu-03 describes a routing problem
that can result when a UA uses a GRUU as its target address.  In the
worse case, shown in Figure 5 of the I-D, assume that a User Agent A
in domain "example.com" has established a dialog with User Agent B in
another domain.  Furthermore, domain "example.com" has a home proxy HP
that maintains and interprets GRUUs in "example.com".  But the home
proxy can only contact UA A via an edge proxy EP.

Thus, when UA A established the dialog with UA B, the message flow
was:

	UA B  <---  HP  <---  EP  <---  UA A

Assuming that both HP and EP Record-Route themselves (EP must R-R
itself), at UA B the full routing (route-set plus target URI) is:

	<sip:hp.example.com;lr>
	<sip:ep.example.com;lr>
	<sip:GRUU-A@example.com>

(The domain names "hp.example.com" and "ep.example.com" are more
likely to be absolute IP addresses, but writing them symbolically
makes the example easier to understand.)

When UA B sends an in-dialog request to UA A, EP is unable to use the
target URI to reach UA A and instead sends the request back to HP, the
server for the domain "example.com".  HP resolves the GRUU to the
contact address, and forwards the request through EP to UA A.  The
full flow is:

	UA B  --->  HP  --->  EP
                              |
                     +--------+
                     |
                     v
	            HP  --->  EP  --->  UA A

Fundamentally the problem is that the Contact header in UA A's request
that established the dialog is being overloaded with two distinct
purposes.  On one hand, we want it to be a globally-valid URI for
contacting UA A, a GRUU.  On the other hand, we want it to be the
final item in a list of addresses of waypoints for routing messages
within the dialog.  But these two requirements are contradictory --
because of NATing or AAA (authentication, authorization, accounting),
there may be no URI that is both gobally routable and usable for
direct access to the UA.

There is a fairly simple solution to this:  When establishing the
dialog, UA A needs to insert a Record-Route that provides its locally
usable contact address, so as to mask the GRUU that is its target URI.
Then, the full routing as seen by UA B is:

	<sip:hp.example.com;lr>
	<sip:ep.example.com;lr>
	<sip:a.example.com;lr>
	<sip:GRUU-A@example.com>

Then, when an in-dialog request from UA B reaches EP, it will have
"Route:  <sip:ep.example.com;lr>", "Route: <sip:a.example.com;lr>",
and a request-URI of "GRUU-A@example.com".  EP recognizes
"ep.example.com" as one of its own addresses and deletes it.  EP then
sends the request to the next Route address, "a.example.com", which is
a locally usable address.

In accordance with normal processing rules, UA A recognizes
"a.example.com" as one of its addresses and removes the Route
containing it.  It then recognizes the request-URI
"GRUU-A@example.com" as also being one of its addresses, and processes
the request.

Clearly, this mechanism can be used simultaneously by both ends of a
dialog.

For the benefit of external diagnostic agents, it may be worth
defining two URI-parameters, one to mark URIs that are GRUUs, and one
to mark route-set URIs that are the locally-usable addresses.  For
example:

	<sip:hp.example.com;lr>
	<sip:ep.example.com;lr>
	<sip:a.example.com;lr;local>
	<sip:GRUU-A@example.com;gruu>

This mechanism does have the limitation that the true target URIs for
the dialog are no longer the stated contact URIs and cannot be changed
during the dialog by a re-INVITE.


* GRUUs when you don't have an AOR.

There are times when a UA doesn't really represent a permanent entity,
and yet it would be useful for it to obtain a GRUU.  (Consider a set
of UAs that form a distributed monitoring system.)  The current system
makes obtaining a GRUU inherently part of registration as a contact
for an AOR.  But as an extension, a registration agent could allow
registrations whose only effect is to create GRUUs, and not create
contact points for an AOR.

A plausible mechanism for this operation is a registration whose To
address (normally the AOR to which the contact is to be registered) is
the same as the registration agent's request-URI, "sip:<domain>".

A simplified example of such a registration and its response is:

   REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
   From: Callee <sip:example.com>;tag=a73kszlfl
   To: Callee <sip:example.com>
   Call-ID: 1j9FpLxk3uxtm8tn@192.0.2.1
   CSeq: 1 REGISTER
   Supported: gruu
   Contact: <sip:callee@192.0.2.1>
     ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"


   SIP/2.0 200 OK
   From: Callee <sip:master@example.com>;tag=a73kszlfl
   To: Callee <sip:example.com> ;tag=b88sn
   Call-ID: 1j9FpLxk3uxtm8tn@192.0.2.1
   CSeq: 1 REGISTER
   Contact: <sip:callee@192.0.2.1>
     ;gruu="sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com"
     ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
     ;expires=3600

After that, the UA at "sip:callee@192.0.2.1" could be reached via
"sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com".


* GRUUs for multiple contacts.

It seems like there may be situations where a single UA has more than
one contact URI for a given AOR.  This might result if there are
several network paths to the UA from a proxy and the proxy is expected
to select among them based on dynamic routing information.  A
registration for this situation looks like:

       REGISTER sip:registrar.biloxi.com SIP/2.0
       Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds7
       Max-Forwards: 70
       To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>
       From: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>;tag=456248
       Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
       CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
       Contact: <sip:bob@192.0.2.4>
       Contact: <sip:bob@10.103.245.86>;q=0.8;bw=high
       Expires: 7200
       Content-Length: 0

In this case, we want to associate both contacts with the GRUU for a
signe instance/AOR pair, and the proxy would route requests to that
GRUU much as it now routes requests to the AOR.  (That is, the routing
decisions would have to be intelligent, but no more intelligent than
routing decisions for the AOR are already.)

But to make this work requires some amendments to the wording of the
I-D.  Consider requesting a GRUU for these contacts:

       REGISTER sip:registrar.biloxi.com SIP/2.0
       Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds7
       Max-Forwards: 70
       To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>
       From: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>;tag=456248
       Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
       CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
       Supported: gruu
       Contact: <sip:bob@192.0.2.4>
           ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
       Contact: <sip:bob@10.103.245.86>;q=0.8;bw=high
           ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
       Expires: 7200
       Content-Length: 0

We want to get the response:

       SIP/2.0 200 OK
       Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds7
	;received=192.0.2.4
       To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>;tag=2493k59kd
       From: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>;tag=456248
       Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
       CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
       Contact: <sip:bob@192.0.2.4>
	   ;gruu="sip:hha9s8d=-999a@biloxi.com"
	   ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
	   ;expires=3600
       Contact: <sip:bob@10.103.245.86>;q=0.8;bw=high
	   ;gruu="sip:hha9s8d=-999a@biloxi.com"
	   ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
	   ;expires=3600
       Expires: 7200
       Content-Length: 0

Both contacts have the same GRUU (of necessity) and have both contacts
bound to the instance/AOR pair.

To achieve this, we change the ending of this passage:

   As the registrar is processing the contacts in the REGISTER request
   according to the procedures of step 7 in Section 10.3 of RFC 3261,
   the registrar additionally checks whether each Contact header field
   in the REGISTER message contains a "+sip.instance" header field
   parameter.  If it does, the registrar takes the value of that
   parameter as an instance ID.

to:

   The registrar checks to see if there is any other contact that was
   bound to the same AOR with the same instance ID (...), but was not
   bound in this REGISTER request.  Any such contact MUST be removed
   as if it was de-registered by the REGISTER request, and processing
   continues.

(This leaves unchanged the ability of the UA to obtain different GRUUs
for different contact addresses by providing different instance IDs
for them.)


* Syntax of URNs

The "sip.instance" parameter has a value which is a URN.  However, a
number of examples in draft-ietf-sip-gruu-03 show the URN surrounded
with "<...>", which is not strictly valid.  Though this would be
unlikely to cause functional problems in real implmentations, the
examples should be corrected:

   Contact: <sip:callee@192.0.2.1>
     ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"

   Contact: <sip:callee@192.0.2.1>
     ;gruu="sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com"
     ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
     ;expires=3600

   Contact: <sip:callee@192.0.2.2>
     ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"

   Contact: <sip:callee@192.0.2.2>
     ;+sip.instance="urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"
     ;expires=3600

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Is anyone aware of any documented mechanisms to send call statistics
at the end of a SIP conversation? I'm looking for something similar to
the Connection Parameters sent back in an MGCP 250 message when
a delete connection is requested.

I know some UA's (Cisco) send these statistics in the SIP 200 BYE
message but I am unable to find any reference to it in any
standards or drafts.

Assuming you mean send the information to the end user, no there is not currently a documented mechanism in IETF.

There is a requirement buried in http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jesske-sipping-tispan-requirements-01.txt as [REQ-AoC-2] which when a solution is decided will provide what you require. Hopefully this will achieve some discussion in Paris.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol Location Conveyance
	Author(s)	: J. Polk, B. Rosen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-00.txt
	Pages		: 43
	Date		: 2005-6-21
	
   This document presents the framework and requirements for usage of 
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to convey user location 
   information from one Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entity to 
   another SIP entity.  We consider cases where location information is
   conveyed from end to end, as well as cases where message routing by 
   intermediaries is influenced by the location of the session 
   initiator.  We offer a set of solutions to the requirements, each 
   based on the scenario being addressed.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.  
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.


Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi Rajeev,
 All the timers relevant to retransmition, I think, is valid in UDP transport only.
 So not only Timer G, but also Timer I,J,K..., are only set to non-zero in UDP.
 E.g. when using reliable transports, retransmitted ACK packets will be absorbed by TCP layer ,but not by SIP transactions.

Rgds
Sun Xianpeng

Not all timers. The timers for retransmitting of the 200 OK to INVITE 
are still applicable for tcp, as they are end-to-end.

The text in section 17 is normative on these timers. The table in the 
appendix is inconsistent in that it mentions the exception for TCP only 
for some of them. That is an error, and I'll log a bug against it.

See the RAQMON drafts:

http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rmonmib-raq
mon-framework-11.txt
http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rmonmib-raq
mon-pdu-10.txt

RAQMON is not SIP specific only, but I believe that it would do the job
you are asking about. One could also define a SIP transport for RAQMON
PDUs to carry session specific information by the end of the session. =20

True. That is a theoretical problem, but I'm still looking for a real

Yeah, this could work. But I haven't heard of a compelling need for it.

This would require authorization. The registrar may not want to provide 
this service to just anybody. And it might not want to provide it for 
other reasons as well. For reasons of tracability it may not want to 
service requests that don't have an associated AoR.

There is other work underway that will do much the same thing, allowing 
the registration of multiple contacts with the same instance id. The 
motivation was to allow registration thru multiple paths for redundancy. 
I think there is a draft, but at the moment I don't recall the name.

The <> is part of the syntax defined in 3840.3841 for callerprefs

I would expect it to be significant only in high mobility applications.

Yes.  I don't think it will be of general use, but it struck me that it
would be good to verify that we could construct an extension to create GRUUs
without AORs within the proposed framework, for those uncommon situations
where it would be useful.

In what way is that different from just registering multiple contacts for
the same AOR?

OK, thanks for explaining that.  Looking at 3840, I guess I never realized
that the "feature predicates" it discusses were to be used for declaring the
features that a UA possesses, rather than what one would expect from the
name, a predicate *filtering* the features of some arbitrary UA.  And
looking at the definition of "Contact Predicate" in section 3, I notice that
it does not really define what the contact predicate is a predicate *of*.
Has there been any clarification of that?

Dale

Aman,

For INVITE transaction, retransmission of requests will only occur when 
client had not received the provisional responses.
In this case, server needs to send the responses for each retransmitted 
request since client transaction is still inCalling state.

In case, when provisional response had been received, no retransmission of 
request occur, and server transaction needs to retransmit final responses 
till it get an ACK. Timer G basically taking care of the retransmission of 
the final responses till ACK is received. 

Hope it clarifies your doubt.

Regards,
Udit

[Sip-implementors] Query on Re-transmission of non 2xx responses in     an 
Invite Transaction










Hi all,

Section 17.2.1 of RFC 3261 says the following for the Invite Server
Transaction:

While in the "Proceeding" state, if the TU passes a response with
status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response
MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state
machine MUST enter the "Completed" state.  For unreliable transports,
timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is not set to fire for
reliable transports.

This is a change from RFC 2543, where responses were always
retransmitted, even over reliable transports.

Additionally as per Figure 7 in the RFC, we are also supposed to
re-transmit the responses, on
receiving the re-transmitted request (as in case of the non-Invite
transaction).

My doubt is that incase the server transaction (say within a Proxy) is
anyways re-transmitting
responses locally (when timer G fires), why do we need to support
re-transmission of responses
for a re-transmitted request, as is suggested in the figure.

One possible situation where this would be required is when, the request
re-transmission timer
at the client transaction is configured to a value less than that of timer
G. But even then when
timer G would fire in the server transaction, we would anyways re-transmit
the response once again.
Thus I feel this additional functionality of re-transmitting responses for
the re-transmitted requests
is not really required.

I would appreciate any clarification on this.

regards
Aman

Hi Aman,

As per 17.2.1 the retransmission of the last sent response on receiving a 
retransmitted request is  MUST only  if the Server transaction is in the 
"Proceeding" state ( 1xx is sent).

However  17.2.1 says about *completed* state ( State after sending 
3xx..6xx responses)  ==>>

"while in the "Completed" state, if a request retransmission is  received, 
the server SHOULD pass the response to the transport for retransmission"

In the *completed* state not retransmitting the final response on 
receiving a retransmitted request may only lead to maximum delay of 4 secs 
for the response to reach to the UAC as timer G is MIN(2*T1,T2). Therefore 
it is not a  MUST condition.

Retransmitting the provisional response in the *proceeding* state is MUST 
because client transaction will stop the retransmission of requests ( 
Timer A  will stop in proceeding state) and possibly UAC will start a 
no-answer timer  on receiving a provisional response only.

Re: [Sip-implementors] Query on Re-transmission of non 2xx responses    in 
an Invite Transaction










hi Udit,

What will happen in a situation where we send out a non 2xx response to 
the
Invite before sending out any
provisional response?
Though 100 Trying is sent, yet in case of a cross, what is the need to
re-transmit the response for a re-transmitted
request, when anyways we are going to perform self re-transmissions? So 
why
does a server transaction need
to re-transmit a response on receiving a re-transmitted request in the
Confirmed State (as per figure 7 in the RFC)

My query was primarily for non 2xx (final responses) to an INVITE.

Aman,

For INVITE transaction, retransmission of requests will only occur when
client had not received the provisional responses.
In this case, server needs to send the responses for each retransmitted
request since client transaction is still inCalling state.

In case, when provisional response had been received, no retransmission of
request occur, and server transaction needs to retransmit final responses
till it get an ACK. Timer G basically taking care of the retransmission of
the final responses till ACK is received.

Hope it clarifies your doubt.

Regards,
Udit

Hi all,

Section 17.2.1 of RFC 3261 says the following for the Invite Server
Transaction:

While in the "Proceeding" state, if the TU passes a response with
status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response
MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state
machine MUST enter the "Completed" state.  For unreliable transports,
timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is not set to fire for
reliable transports.

This is a change from RFC 2543, where responses were always
retransmitted, even over reliable transports.

Additionally as per Figure 7 in the RFC, we are also supposed to
re-transmit the responses, on
receiving the re-transmitted request (as in case of the non-Invite
transaction).

| Terminated|<---------------+
|           |
+-----------+


My doubt is that incase the server transaction (say within a Proxy) is
anyways re-transmitting
responses locally (when timer G fires), why do we need to support
re-transmission of responses
for a re-transmitted request, as is suggested in the figure.

One possible situation where this would be required is when, the request
re-transmission timer
at the client transaction is configured to a value less than that of timer
G. But even then when
timer G would fire in the server transaction, we would anyways re-transmit
the response once again.
Thus I feel this additional functionality of re-transmitting responses for
the re-transmitted requests
is not really required.

I would appreciate any clarification on this.

regards
Aman

Hi all,<br>
<br>
Section 17.2.1 of RFC 3261 says the following for the Invite Server<br>
Transaction:<br>
<br>
While in the &quot;Proceeding&quot; state, if the TU passes a response
with<br>
status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response<br>
MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state<br>
machine MUST enter the &quot;Completed&quot; state. &nbsp;For unreliable
transports,<br>
timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is not set to fire for<br>
reliable transports.<br>
<br>
This is a change from RFC 2543, where responses were always<br>
retransmitted, even over reliable transports.<br>
<br>
Additionally as per Figure 7 in the RFC, we are also supposed to<br>
re-transmit the responses, on<br>
receiving the re-transmitted request (as in case of the non-Invite<br>
transaction).<br>

<br>
<br>
My doubt is that incase the server transaction (say within a Proxy) is<br>
anyways re-transmitting<br>
responses locally (when timer G fires), why do we need to support<br>
re-transmission of responses<br>
for a re-transmitted request, as is suggested in the figure.<br>
<br>
One possible situation where this would be required is when, the request<br>
re-transmission timer<br>
at the client transaction is configured to a value less than that of timer<br>
G. But even then when<br>
timer G would fire in the server transaction, we would anyways re-transmit<br>
the response once again.<br>
Thus I feel this additional functionality of re-transmitting responses
for<br>
the re-transmitted requests<br>
is not really required.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate any clarification on this.<br>
<br>

The draft I was thinking of is draft-jennings-sipping-outbound-01.txt. 
It allows multiple registrations with the same instance id, but 
distinguished by a unique flow id. Only one registration per 
instanceid/flowid pair is permitted.

This doesn't explicitly address GRUU, but the gruu mechanism should work 
with it - the same gruu would be assigned as long as the instanceid 
remains the same. In this draft you wouldn't be registering multiple 
contacts in the same REGISTER call, since the point is to send them over 
different paths.

So this isn't quite the same thing, but the same mechanisms might 
support both. At least it would be helpful for you to coordinate what 
you have in mind with that.

[This is a general area review.  This review of draft .9 is intended as 
early review for the IESG consideration.
  Details on the general area review team can be found at 
http://www.alvestrand.no/ietf/gen/art/review-guidelines.html
  The reviewer apologizes for not getting these minor comments to the 
relevant parties sooner.]

This document appears ready for publication as a Proposed Standard.  There 
are some minor matters that ought to be attended to.

Section 4.7.1.1 states that "A UAC in an administrative domain that employs 
preemption MUST ..."  I know what administrative domains usually mean, but 
it seems likely that in this case there may be at least three different 
administrative domains that the UAC is "in".  There is the IP domain at and 
near the originating UAC which may have SIP Proxies (either mandated by 
policy or transparently inserted.)  There is the domain of the subscribers 
chosen outbound proxy (if any), and there is the domain of the destination 
UAC.  There may be other domains along the signaling path.  Given the 
multiplicity of domains, and that a client may change domains, one of two 
things seems necessary.
Preferably, just require that ALL UACs supporting this RFC be prepared to 
receive the BYE with sipping reason ....  This does not seem onerous, and 
does seem to solve the issue.
Alternatively, the text needs a clear explanation of what "administrative 
domain" is meant and how a UAC would know whether to be prepared to receive 
the error indication.  Given the difficulty of building client software for 
specific administrative domains, this seems a doubtful choice.

Joel:

thanks for taking the time to review the draft. I agree that words like 
"administrative domain" can be interpreted in multiple ways, 
particularly in the multi-hop cases you mention. (Many of the 
participants in the discussion tend to assume that R-P operates in 
relatively closed environments where this would not be a concern, in 
that UAC, UAS and proxies would be administered by the same authority.)

To address your comment: Since the Reason header causes no protocol 
state transitions, ANY UAC 'must (will) be prepared to receive it' 
(since there are no preparations to be taken - ignoring it will work 
just fine). The header really only makes sense here if the UAC requested 
a resource value that can cause preemption. Thus, I would reword the 
nettlesome sentence as something like

"A UAC that requests a priority value that may cause preemption MUST 
understand a Reason header field in the BYE request explaining why the 
session was terminated, as discussed in []."

If nobody objects, I will replace the sentence.

Henning

That would take care of my problems with the sentence.

draft-ietf-sip-sctp-06.txt has a note:

Note that the value "tls", defined by RFC 3261, is intended for TLS over
TCP.

on the other hand 26.2.2 of rfc3261 has a note:

The use of transport=tls has consequently been deprecated, partly
because it was specific to a single hop of the request.

so if a transport parameter indicating tls over tcp has been deprecated,
why do we now need a transport parameter indicating tls over sctp?  what
makes sctp in this regards special as compared to tcp?

My concerns with such a solution are:
- how can the UA A determine its address a.example.com? Especially with NAT's 
between the UA and the proxies this a big problem again, or?
- the UA needs to implement Route processing logic, which was not necessary up 
to now.

I think it would make more sense to not solve such routing problems not in the 
implementation but by the particular installation, because they know a lot 
better which instance is able to handle what. For the given example two 
possible routing sets could look like this:

  <sip:hp.example.com;lr>
  <sip:GRUU-A@example.com>

Or

  <sip:hp.example.com;lr>
  <sip:ep.example.com;lr>
  <sip:hp.example.com;lr>
  <sip:GRUU-A@example.com>

Both are transparent for the UAs. But I admit that they will result in a new 
connection between the UA A and hp for in-dialog requests (which are send by 
UA A) which might not be desired.

In any case it seems to be a very bad idea to install any required "services" 
which need to see in-dialog requests on proxies which can not resolve the 
GRUU contact (ep in this case.) If accounting etc. is handled at hp and ep is 
not required in the Route this prevents a lot of problems.

The details are given in the two documents describing the actual models. 
The framework only provides a rough description of both models.

Yes, I will add such a reference.

What would be the advantages of this model?

Note that this model would require B to understand a set of extensions 
(e.g., REFER, Replaces) while the existing models work with vanilla SIP 
user agents on the side that does not invoke the transcoder.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Hi,

Please find below the comments for the draft mentioned
in the subject.


regards
Rayees
Flextronics Software Systems

----------------------------------------------------------

1. In general we have considred two models for
transcoding service invocation based on 3PCC and
Bridging model. A hybrid of the two in case of
transcoding could be considered as an alternate model,
so that 3PCC as well as the server (T) has control
over the session. Party A would be interested in
control for the reason of initiating the session, and
T would be interested in controlling session to
effectively manage its resources
2. There is a typo in the draft in section 3.2
mentioning 'end-poing' instead of 'end-point'.

Hi Gonzalo,

One of the things that would improve the draft would
be to include the message 
format of the messages that would be exchanged in the
call flow. In section 3.1, there is a link ([10]) to
the document that describes it all but for 3.2 I could
not find such link.

What I have understood from the two section is
o section 3.1 - after initial dialog is established by
A with B and T, it 
  would manage the exposure of transport address of B
and T to both
o section 3.2 - A establishes dialog with T, which
acts as a B2B UA. However, 
  it would additionally act as a MiddleBox
Communication server (RFC 3304) 
  and establishes dialog with B.

The alternate model could be a hybrid one. The figure
below depicts the 
signaling relationship between the parties. 

A establishes a signaling dialog with B, and comes to
know about the capabilites
of B. It realizes the need for transcoding so
establishes dialog with T, 
queries it for resources. If response is positive from
T it uses REFER method 
mechanism to inform B about signaling contacts of T. B
initiates session with C 
joining the dialog as described in RFC 3911.

Hi all,

Section 17.2.1 of RFC 3261 says the following for the Invite Server
Transaction:

While in the "Proceeding" state, if the TU passes a response with
status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response
MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state
machine MUST enter the "Completed" state.  For unreliable transports,
timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is not set to fire for
reliable transports.

      This is a change from RFC 2543, where responses were always
      retransmitted, even over reliable transports.

Additionally as per Figure 7 in the RFC, we are also supposed to
re-transmit the responses, on
receiving the re-transmitted request (as in case of the non-Invite
transaction).

My doubt is that incase the server transaction (say within a Proxy) is
anyways re-transmitting
responses locally (when timer G fires), why do we need to support
re-transmission of responses
for a re-transmitted request, as is suggested in the figure.

One possible situation where this would be required is when, the request
re-transmission timer
at the client transaction is configured to a value less than that of timer
G. But even then when
timer G would fire in the server transaction, we would anyways re-transmit
the response once again.
Thus I feel this additional functionality of re-transmitting responses for
the re-transmitted requests
is not really required.

I would appreciate any clarification on this.

Aman

hi Udit,

What will happen in a situation where we send out a non 2xx response to the
Invite before sending out any
provisional response?
Though 100 Trying is sent, yet in case of a cross, what is the need to
re-transmit the response for a re-transmitted
request, when anyways we are going to perform self re-transmissions? So why
does a server transaction need
to re-transmit a response on receiving a re-transmitted request in the
Confirmed State (as per figure 7 in the RFC)

My query was primarily for non 2xx (final responses) to an INVITE.

Aman,

For INVITE transaction, retransmission of requests will only occur when
client had not received the provisional responses.
In this case, server needs to send the responses for each retransmitted
request since client transaction is still inCalling state.

In case, when provisional response had been received, no retransmission of
request occur, and server transaction needs to retransmit final responses
till it get an ACK. Timer G basically taking care of the retransmission of
the final responses till ACK is received.

Hope it clarifies your doubt.

Regards,
Udit

Hi all,

Section 17.2.1 of RFC 3261 says the following for the Invite Server
Transaction:

While in the "Proceeding" state, if the TU passes a response with
status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response
MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state
machine MUST enter the "Completed" state.  For unreliable transports,
timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is not set to fire for
reliable transports.

This is a change from RFC 2543, where responses were always
retransmitted, even over reliable transports.

Additionally as per Figure 7 in the RFC, we are also supposed to
re-transmit the responses, on
receiving the re-transmitted request (as in case of the non-Invite
transaction).

My doubt is that incase the server transaction (say within a Proxy) is
anyways re-transmitting
responses locally (when timer G fires), why do we need to support
re-transmission of responses
for a re-transmitted request, as is suggested in the figure.

One possible situation where this would be required is when, the request
re-transmission timer
at the client transaction is configured to a value less than that of timer
G. But even then when
timer G would fire in the server transaction, we would anyways re-transmit
the response once again.
Thus I feel this additional functionality of re-transmitting responses for
the re-transmitted requests
is not really required.

I would appreciate any clarification on this.

regards
Aman

I wish I knew.

I'd like to ask Jon Peterson to comment, as I think he contributed that 
line of deprecation to 3261. Then again, it was debated during a 
conference call at 3:00 AM as I was attending a 3GPP meeting in Sophia 
Antipolis, so I might remember wrong.

But in any case, it's a good question.

James, Brian,

In section 9 (special provisions for emergency calls) it states:

"In the case where the Proxy knows the location of the UAC and does not
detect the UAC's location information message body in the message (or
determines the LO is bad), the Proxy generates a new 4XX (Retry Location
Body) error message that includes a location information message body for
that UAC to include in the subsequent message.  The user agent MUST include
this message body in the subsequent emergency message."

This places a new requirement on the UAC, which will not be met by UACs that
are not compliant to this document. It seems emergency calls from such UACs
will fail.

Regards,

John

Hi,

      RFC 3329 (Security Agreement Mechanism for SIP) specifies=20

that a client should insert both a Require and a Proxy-Require=20

header with value "sec-agree" (See Sec 2.3.1 Client Initiated=20

mechanism). Subsequently, after successful processing, the proxy=20

removes this token from *both* the headers.=20

My question is, why does the client need to add a=20

"Require: sec-agree" when only the proxy is required to support=20

this feature in this scenario ? As I understand it, it would have=20

The reason for this is that, realistically speaking, there is no
possible way for a UA to guess if the node in the next-hop is really a
proxy or a UA. In addition to that, a general Require would work if
you assume that the first message going out is an OPTIONS to its
next-node. It is also possible for the UAC to just start with an
INVITE directly, in which case, the proxy, seeing an INVITE request
not destined for itself will pass it along without complying to the
sec-agree requirements.

Therefore, it was suggested that a UA inserts *both* require and
proxy-require. The downside, however, is that now the next-hop  would
need to strip both headers before sending it out. Its the lesser of
two evils, I guess.
