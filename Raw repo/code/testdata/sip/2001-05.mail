Hello everyone,
 
 Can anybody tell me where I can get some specifications for sip conference

May I suggest that

- "is there a SIP implementation that does foo?" belongs on the
sip-implementors list or, better yet, on the SIP Forum mailing lists.

- secondly, that vendors do not answer the questions in public, as
tempting as this may be. There are a number of SIP implementation web
pages out there (I happen to maintain one of them, as does the SIP Forum
and other vendor-neutral organizations) which will gladly add a pointer
to your implementation, free of charge. 

Thank you.

(No, I'm not the moderator, but with the number of SIP products out
there, I hope there's agreement we don't want to turn this list into a
marketing event, I would hope. The problem is that once one vendor
"announces" their product, every other vendor's marketing group feels
obligated to do the same.)

Henning

Thank you, Henning.

I would like to reinforce this request. Distribution of commercial product
information is considered in rather poor taste by the IETF (we try to be
non-product and vendor independent, remember?). Notice that I don't even use
my employer's email addressing when working here, because we have product in
this sector.

Your efforts in helping to maintain purity here will be appreciated.

Thanks!

Jonathan,

The point were this is likely to be tested is firewall traversal. For
security reasons, we are tempted to open a pinhole that specifies a
"five tuple" -- source and destination IP address and port, protocol
type. This requires being able to predict the source address used by the
other end. According to your rule, we would not be able to do that. This
seems reason enough to reconsider.

By the way, the technical argument that you give is weak. It is possible
to bind a socket to an address, which makes address selection possible
even on multi-homed machines.

Service providers may have a need to be able to send RTP streams to a port
and receive RTP streams from a different port (different IP address and UDP
port). Jonathan Rosenberg's point would solve that need. But security is
definitely an issue (i.e. if no encryption method such as TLS/SSL has been
decided between sender & receiver). After an entity sends its receiving port
through SDP and does not care who sends data to that receiving port is most
probably not going to be an acceptable solution to many providers who may
not wish to use encryption either. 
So shouldn't SDP RFC be enhanced to be able to include the sending port in
case different from the receiving port?

Thanks.

Jonathan,

The point were this is likely to be tested is firewall traversal. For
security reasons, we are tempted to open a pinhole that specifies a
"five tuple" -- source and destination IP address and port, protocol
type. This requires being able to predict the source address used by the
other end. According to your rule, we would not be able to do that. This
seems reason enough to reconsider.

By the way, the technical argument that you give is weak. It is possible
to bind a socket to an address, which makes address selection possible
even on multi-homed machines.

Hi
    But why should the receiver know about sender's sending port? Like if
you go back to socket programming, the server only
needs to know client's receiving port for sending data. it does not bother
about client's sending port. So I feel there is no need
to include sender's port number in the data.

Any comments??

Regards
Ranjit

Service providers may have a need to be able to send RTP streams to a port
and receive RTP streams from a different port (different IP address and UDP
port). Jonathan Rosenberg's point would solve that need. But security is
definitely an issue (i.e. if no encryption method such as TLS/SSL has been
decided between sender & receiver). After an entity sends its receiving port
through SDP and does not care who sends data to that receiving port is most
probably not going to be an acceptable solution to many providers who may

AAA/Policy management also likes to have session 5-tuple
information on which to make a policy based admission
and AAA decisions. Ideally, this information would
be relayed to the SIP proxy in SIP messages, then
forwarded via other protocols to AAA/policy servers.
AAA/policy actions would be taken before media
was sent.

The receiver (UAS) does not need to know the sender's sending port, but a
SIP proxy or ALG in the signalling path that needs to tell a middlebox (e.g.
NAT or Firewall) to let the RTP flow thru needs the sender's sending port,
otherwise it has to say let all packets from any IP Address and port thru to
the sender's (UAC's) receiving port. That would be a very bad thing from a
security point of view.

Hi.

Is there any way to authenticate a response in SIP?

In particular, if a UAS sends a redirect response, is there any way to
verify that this response is indeed coming from the UAS I invited and is not
being spoofed? 
How can I make sure I am being redirected to the right place?

Digest as far as I know applies only to requests and not responses?

Any Suggestions?

A couple of minor points on this draft as it enters Last 
Call Review ...

- The introduction includes third party control as an example
of call control but the remainder of the document doesn't
mention the body of work that exists for SIP 3pcc or how
this relates to the proposed model.

- Is the reference to draft-mahy-sip-cc-models-00.txt
valid? I can't track down this draft at the IETF site.

Cheers,
Neil.

Hi everyone,

I'd like to present the following for comment by the list:

Below is a proposal for handling some aspects of Early Media using both the
RFC2543bis-02 and the manyfolks draft for resource reservation. This
proposal could be applied in systems that will always use the manyfolks
extension to enable resource reservation, QoS, and security. An example
application would be the IMS in a 3GPP mobile network. In this example the
need for Early Media arises from interworking with the PSTN; specifically
for:
- delivery of call progress tones and
- to prevent clipping of voice on answer.

My question is: Is this interpretation of how the manyfolks draft can be
used in combination with the RFC2543bis-02 acceptable?

Early Media & Manyfolks:

- "Manyfolks" discusses how network QoS and security establishment can be
made a precondition to sessions initiated by SIP, and described by SDP.
- It allows SDP to be sent inside 1xx provisional responses (other than 100)
and PRACKs.
- Note that from a standards point of view the SDP is not to be used to
negotiate media and codecs. The sender of an SDP is required to accept any
of the media/codecs it included.
- However, if a system level requirement is imposed that a single media type
and codec is to be used in both send and receive directions, negotiation to
a single choice of media and codec is effectively what happens.

Call flow:

In this call flow the UAS is acting as the signalling gateway to the PSTN.
The details of what is included in the SDP body is omitted here for
simplicity, but it is assumed that the necessary parameters are included to
ensure that establishment of QoS is mandatory in both directions as a
precondition of the call.

[Call now established. Rest of the call flow omitted]


SIP RFC2543bis02 draft offers a number of options for event #14. The UAS can
send any of the following to the UAC at this stage:

1. 180 with SDP, port=0 means called party alerting, play local ringing
2. 180 with SDP, port>0 means called party alerting, play media
3. 183 with SDP, port=0 means address complete, play local ringing
4. 183 with SDP, port>0 means address complete, play media
5. 180 without SDP means called party alerting, continue existing behaviour
6. 183 without SDP means address complete, continue existing behaviour
(In all cases the SDP can only include media agreed earlier by the UAC and
UAS.)

These options might be used for the following reasons in the example call
flow:
- 180 indicates that the ACM received included indication that the called
subscriber was free (and therefore alerting)
- 183 indicates that the ACM received did not indicate the status of the
callee
- Including SDP with port=0 indicates to the UAS to cease playing any media
and synthesise ringing
- Including SDP with port>0 indicates to the UAS to cease any local ringing
and play any arriving media
- Not including an SDP means the UAS should continue its current behaviour
regarding ringing or playing media

In the call flow above, the SDP in event #14 has a non-zero port number.
This has the effect of indicating to the UAC that it should continue to play
early media. Alternatively if we assume that in event #2 an SDP was included
in the 183 with port>0, the absence of SDP in #14 would have had the same
effect; i.e. that any early media arriving at the UAC would have continued
to be been played.

In this example call flow the caller at the UAC would have listened to early
media, carrying the sound of far end ringing from the PSTN between event #13
and #16/17.

Additional Issues arising:

1. The use of setting port numbers in SDP to 0 in order to indicate media
flow should cease is an IP specific solution and goes against the grain of
SIP being independent of the bearer protocol in use. This is a much wider
protocol issue.  Has any work been done on a generic method for indicating
media should stop being played?

2. In flow #14 above, the port number in the SDP may be set to 0 to indicate
to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it receives.  However, bis02
indicates that any SDP sent from a node refers to the media which that node
can receive.  Is it acceptable to use the backwards SDP (from UAS to UAC) to
indicate to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it is receiving or
is there a need for a new indication?

Any comments would be most welcome.

Many thanks

I dont think that source port/IP address checks provide
any security in this matter. The real security would be using
encryption which may be expensive and hard to get right.

If a hacker wants to break down a call, or interfere with it,
changing the source address/port of the packets which he sends
to that of the actual source is probably the easiest thing to do.
So if the receiver is concerned about security, he must take other
measures as well, in addition to source check. Once we have them in place,
maybe the source check wont be that necessary, and may in fact become
a problem for protocol design later.

This is a good question. As we discovered at the interrim meeting in Plano,
there are a lot of extremely complicated issues surrounding it.

In the interest of keeping the majority of us who can still claim
sanity sane, I'd *strongly* suggest postponing discussion of this
issue on the list until we blow through a few more of our work
items (http://www.greycouncil.com/sipwg/draftstatus/lc_calendar.html).

Subject: [SIP] Early Media using the manyfolks draft


Hi everyone,
I'd like to present the following for comment by the list:
Below is a proposal for handling some aspects of Early Media using both the
RFC2543bis-02 and the manyfolks draft for resource reservation. This proposal
could be applied in systems that will always use the manyfolks extension to
enable resource reservation, QoS, and security. An example application would be
the IMS in a 3GPP mobile network. In this example the need for Early Media
arises from interworking with the PSTN; specifically for:
- delivery of call progress tones and
- to prevent clipping of voice on answer.
My question is: Is this interpretation of how the manyfolks draft can be used
in combination with the RFC2543bis-02 acceptable?
Early Media & Manyfolks:
- "Manyfolks" discusses how network QoS and security establishment can be made
a precondition to sessions initiated by SIP, and described by SDP.
- It allows SDP to be sent inside 1xx provisional responses (other than 100)
and PRACKs.
- Note that from a standards point of view the SDP is not to be used to
negotiate media and codecs. The sender of an SDP is required to accept any of
the media/codecs it included.
- However, if a system level requirement is imposed that a single media type
and codec is to be used in both send and receive directions, negotiation to a
single choice of media and codec is effectively what happens.
Call flow:
In this call flow the UAS is acting as the signalling gateway to the PSTN. The
details of what is included in the SDP body is omitted here for simplicity, but
it is assumed that the necessary parameters are included to ensure that
establishment of QoS is mandatory in both directions as a precondition of the
call.

[Call now established. Rest of the call flow omitted]


SIP RFC2543bis02 draft offers a number of options for event #14. The UAS can
send any of the following to the UAC at this stage:
1. 180 with SDP, port=0 means called party alerting, play local ringing
2. 180 with SDP, port>0 means called party alerting, play media
3. 183 with SDP, port=0 means address complete, play local ringing
4. 183 with SDP, port>0 means address complete, play media
5. 180 without SDP means called party alerting, continue existing behaviour
6. 183 without SDP means address complete, continue existing behaviour
(In all cases the SDP can only include media agreed earlier by the UAC and
UAS.)
These options might be used for the following reasons in the example call flow:
- 180 indicates that the ACM received included indication that the called
subscriber was free (and therefore alerting)
- 183 indicates that the ACM received did not indicate the status of the callee
- Including SDP with port=0 indicates to the UAS to cease playing any media and
synthesise ringing
- Including SDP with port>0 indicates to the UAS to cease any local ringing and
play any arriving media
- Not including an SDP means the UAS should continue its current behaviour
regarding ringing or playing media
In the call flow above, the SDP in event #14 has a non-zero port number. This
has the effect of indicating to the UAC that it should continue to play early
media. Alternatively if we assume that in event #2 an SDP was included in the
183 with port>0, the absence of SDP in #14 would have had the same effect; i.e.
that any early media arriving at the UAC would have continued to be been
played.
In this example call flow the caller at the UAC would have listened to early
media, carrying the sound of far end ringing from the PSTN between event #13
and #16/17.
Additional Issues arising:
1. The use of setting port numbers in SDP to 0 in order to indicate media flow
should cease is an IP specific solution and goes against the grain of SIP being
independent of the bearer protocol in use. This is a much wider protocol issue.
Has any work been done on a generic method for indicating media should stop
being played?
2. In flow #14 above, the port number in the SDP may be set to 0 to indicate to
the UAC to stop playing any early media that it receives.  However, bis02
indicates that any SDP sent from a node refers to the media which that node can
receive.  Is it acceptable to use the backwards SDP (from UAS to UAC) to
indicate to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it is receiving or is
there a need for a new indication?
Any comments would be most welcome.

One of the most interesting outcome of this discussion should be a memo
describing the requirements to the MIDCOM protocol, and then a reverse
memo describing the requirement imposed by midcom to SIP. As it stands
today, we have the following:

1) Conventional firewall logic is that you want to open a pin-hole, not
a truck-sized gap. This means that a five-tuple hole is preferred
(protocol type, two address and port pairs) over a three-tuple (internal
address+port pair, protocol type).

2) Our current specification of early media only works if the client can
receive media immediately after sending an INVITE, which requires
opening a three-tuple hole.

3) The five-tuple can only be known by the caller after receiving the
200-OK. This creates a race condition between the signaling message and
the first RTP packets sent by the callee; should the 200-OK loose the
race, the early RTP packets will bang against a closed firewall and be
clipped. 

4) The only way to guarantee that we don't have clipping of the initial
packets is to require that no RTP packet be sent until the initial ACK
is received. This is a problem similar to the "resource reservation"
issue studied in the manyfolks draft. Since we want to enable media
immediately after the call acceptation, this means that we have some
kind of two-phase set-up: first set up a path with an initial three ways
handshake, and then re-invite and start ringing. Doing that is not
compatible with existing implementations, and would require a serious
revisiting of the gatewaying between POTS and SIP.

5) Even if we implemented the two-phase handshake, the early-media
problem would remain. There is a common telephony practice of sending
recorded announcements during call set-up; the source IP address of
these announcements is not likely to be the same as the source IP
address used after call set-up is complete. It is theoretically possible
to use the equivalent of call transfer to switch between multiple source
in a controlled fashion, but this introduce a lot of signaling
complexity.

6) The source IP address should be allowed to change during a call, e.g.
if we want calls to outlive network renumbering. SIP supports that
through the re-invite mechanism, but enforcing a five-tuple control
introduces either a gap in the call or a race condition between RTP
packets with the new source address and the re-INVITE.  
 
7) Even if we changed the call flows, there are doubts that we can
actually specify the five tuple, at least for the incoming packets: the
source IP address may be unpredictable in the case of multi-homed hosts;
the source port may be systematically different from the receive port in
some implementation, e.g. parallel processing of the send and receive
channels by different software or hardware components.

8) Many implementations already support exchange of RTP level
authentication and encryption keys during the SIP call set-up. This
provides a level of security that is at least as good as any control of
the source address and port: if attackers can manage to read the
signaling exchange and get the keys, they can just as well discover the
IP addresses and ports, and send forged packets.

So, can we convince midcom that we actually need to open holes that are
a tiny bit larger than the initial pin-hole? Maybe something like a
three-tuple hole on the receive side, and either a three-tuple or a
five-tuple on the sending side?

This would only change the nature of the clipping.  Rather than a firewall
dropping packets on the floor, your going to have a callee talking into the
phone with no RTP packets being produced.  From the perspective of the
caller, the problem has actually gotten worse by waiting for the ACK because
there is extra roundtrip time.

I should have written, "no RTP packet until a three ways handshake has
been completed." The manyfolks draft uses a combination of PRACK and
COMET to achieve this result.

Hi Christian,

Good points.

I would rephrase (2) to say that early media (in this scenario) does not
work unless the UAC assumes symmetric RTP and the UAS provide an SDP in the
provisional response. That is, unless the UAS provides an SDP body in the
18x response and the UAC builds a {five-tuple} from it. This was discussed a
little last month on the list. 

I really wonder (ie, reality check):
a)	How many people are not using symmetric RTP currently (ie, not
sending from same source IP/port as you receive).
b)	How many current (non-sandpit) SIP products really allow RTP media
to come from _any_ IP address and port.  
c)	If any one can come up with non-neurotic reasons why it is necessary
to send from a different IP address than you send from.[Realistically!] If
so, I still believe there are other ways around this specialist scenario.

Regards,

Robert.

Subject:	RE: [SIP] meaning of IP address in SDP

One of the most interesting outcome of this discussion should be a memo
describing the requirements to the MIDCOM protocol, and then a reverse
memo describing the requirement imposed by midcom to SIP. As it stands
today, we have the following:

1) Conventional firewall logic is that you want to open a pin-hole, not
a truck-sized gap. This means that a five-tuple hole is preferred
(protocol type, two address and port pairs) over a three-tuple (internal
address+port pair, protocol type).

2) Our current specification of early media only works if the client can
receive media immediately after sending an INVITE, which requires
opening a three-tuple hole.

3) The five-tuple can only be known by the caller after receiving the
200-OK. This creates a race condition between the signaling message and
the first RTP packets sent by the callee; should the 200-OK loose the
race, the early RTP packets will bang against a closed firewall and be
clipped. 

4) The only way to guarantee that we don't have clipping of the initial
packets is to require that no RTP packet be sent until the initial ACK
is received. This is a problem similar to the "resource reservation"
issue studied in the manyfolks draft. Since we want to enable media
immediately after the call acceptation, this means that we have some
kind of two-phase set-up: first set up a path with an initial three ways
handshake, and then re-invite and start ringing. Doing that is not
compatible with existing implementations, and would require a serious
revisiting of the gatewaying between POTS and SIP.

5) Even if we implemented the two-phase handshake, the early-media
problem would remain. There is a common telephony practice of sending
recorded announcements during call set-up; the source IP address of
these announcements is not likely to be the same as the source IP
address used after call set-up is complete. It is theoretically possible
to use the equivalent of call transfer to switch between multiple source
in a controlled fashion, but this introduce a lot of signaling
complexity.

6) The source IP address should be allowed to change during a call, e.g.
if we want calls to outlive network renumbering. SIP supports that
through the re-invite mechanism, but enforcing a five-tuple control
introduces either a gap in the call or a race condition between RTP
packets with the new source address and the re-INVITE.  
 
7) Even if we changed the call flows, there are doubts that we can
actually specify the five tuple, at least for the incoming packets: the
source IP address may be unpredictable in the case of multi-homed hosts;
the source port may be systematically different from the receive port in
some implementation, e.g. parallel processing of the send and receive
channels by different software or hardware components.

8) Many implementations already support exchange of RTP level
authentication and encryption keys during the SIP call set-up. This
provides a level of security that is at least as good as any control of
the source address and port: if attackers can manage to read the
signaling exchange and get the keys, they can just as well discover the
IP addresses and ports, and send forged packets.

So, can we convince midcom that we actually need to open holes that are
a tiny bit larger than the initial pin-hole? Maybe something like a
three-tuple hole on the receive side, and either a three-tuple or a
five-tuple on the sending side?

I'm not. It's easier for my application to have separate sending
and receiving threads, each managing its own socket.

I'll bet there are other implementations doing the same thing.

HI Adam

Yes, I imagine there might be a few implementations doing this but how many
use a completely different IP address?

I imagine that most implementations currently ignore the source port.
However this "four tuple" is still a lot better for opening holes in
firewalls than nothing at all (of course full symmetric RTP is the more
preferable).

Alternatively, what about adding a SIP option requesting the UA's use
symmetric RTP? Require: symmetric-media ? If symmetric media is required to
cross a NAT or firewall then the proxy/UA should be able to request this
from the UA's in order for the call to be _successfully_ established.
[Otherwise you will get that annoying situation where the UA says the call
is connected but you can't hear the other person.]

Robert.

This solution would also allow policy management
on a more stringent level (5-tuple instead of
3-tuple) - a desireable feature.

I'm not. It's easier for my application to have separate sending 
and receiving threads, each managing its own socket. 

I'll bet there are other implementations doing the same thing.

	Hello everybody,

	I followed your discussion on how to protect the
	registration information and I do not totally agree
	with all that was mentioned.

	On the one hand, I agree that the digest auth. scheme
	as it is currently defined, is not protecting enough 
	information!
	As you all know even then auth-int alternative do
	not protect any of the header fields at all.
	Ok, it enable us to protect the registration body
	such as cpl script for example but like James mentioned
	it do not protect the contact we register.
	
	If you remember, I already proposed, a few weeks ago,
	a very simple extension to the digest auth-int alternative
	such as to mimic the pgp protection scheme as proposed
	so far.
	With this extension we enable, the sip security framework
	to provide integrity to sip message sensible parts (set of 
	headers and message body). Unfortunately, I did not receive
	any feedback after Jonathan Lenox proposed me to move the 
	thread to the main sip list...

	I also agree with you Jonathan concerning the need of a set
	of other security mechanisms based on private/public keys.
	And I do believe that sip security framework's future will be
	mainly focused on public/private keys framework.
	nb: What Henning also suggested with the SSL channel is 
	again going into the direction of a keys oriented security
	framework.

	However, I do not agree on the idea to depreciate the use
	of PGP. I think that the security feature that PGP offers us 
	are already of a good interest regarding the path to a strong
	key based security framework.
	Just to add some words on the 'man in the middle' scenario 
	discussed in this thread, PGP enables you to completely prevent
	this from happening as it is impossible to reproduce a valid
	signature if you do not have access to the private key of the
	signer. Note that replay attack are also prevented as the digital 
	signature check will fail as soon as a character in the set of 
	protected data is modified. The only thing that a hacker might do,
	if he wants the signature check to succeed, is to resend the same
	protected data in his new message. 

	(Finally, PGP is very easy and fast to to implements and it also 
	provide us with encryption opportunity, so I believe that thinking
	to forget about PGP is not a good idea)
	
	This problem of 'strong' security aspect such as authentication,
	data integrity and even data encryption are not only bind to 
	register, subscribe messages for example are also concerned 
	by this thread.
	
	
		Carmelo

Please mention in draft-ietf-sip-session-timer 
that the UAS SHOULD reply with non-changed-SDP 
to a re-INVITE with non-changed-SDP.  
[Notice that I am only asking for a SHOULD since 
the draft currently allows the re-INVITE to 
revive a dead session (even if the sender 
didn't want that to happen).]

I'm requesting it to be explicitly stated in 
the draft because some products that require 
others to send re-INVITE session refreshers 
actually change the origin line in the 200 
response SDP without changing anything else
in the SDP.

I hope the chairs (and Jonathan...) will excuse this non-technical
contribution, but I'm pleased to note that Jonathan Rosenberg
successfully defended his dissertation in the Electrical Engineering
Department at Columbia University today and is now (semi-officially) Dr.
Rosenberg. Well deserved.

Reposted due to mail problems - apologies to anyone who receives this
message twice.

Hi everyone,

I'd like to present the following for comment by the list:

Below is a proposal for handling some aspects of Early Media using both the
RFC2543bis-02 and the manyfolks draft for resource reservation. This
proposal could be applied in systems that will always use the manyfolks
extension to enable resource reservation, QoS, and security. An example
application would be the IMS in a 3GPP mobile network. In this example the
need for Early Media arises from interworking with the PSTN; specifically
for:
- delivery of call progress tones and
- to prevent clipping of voice on answer.

My question is: Is this interpretation of how the manyfolks draft can be
used in combination with the RFC2543bis-02 acceptable?

Early Media & Manyfolks:

- "Manyfolks" discusses how network QoS and security establishment can be
made a precondition to sessions initiated by SIP, and described by SDP.
- It allows SDP to be sent inside 1xx provisional responses (other than 100)
and PRACKs.
- Note that from a standards point of view the SDP is not to be used to
negotiate media and codecs. The sender of an SDP is required to accept any
of the media/codecs it included.
- However, if a system level requirement is imposed that a single media type
and codec is to be used in both send and receive directions, negotiation to
a single choice of media and codec is effectively what happens.

Call flow:

In this call flow the UAS is acting as the signalling gateway to the PSTN.
The details of what is included in the SDP body is omitted here for
simplicity, but it is assumed that the necessary parameters are included to
ensure that establishment of QoS is mandatory in both directions as a
precondition of the call.

[Call now established. Rest of the call flow omitted]


SIP RFC2543bis02 draft offers a number of options for event #14. The UAS can
send any of the following to the UAC at this stage:

1. 180 with SDP, port=0 means called party alerting, play local ringing
2. 180 with SDP, port>0 means called party alerting, play media
3. 183 with SDP, port=0 means address complete, play local ringing
4. 183 with SDP, port>0 means address complete, play media
5. 180 without SDP means called party alerting, continue existing behaviour
6. 183 without SDP means address complete, continue existing behaviour
(In all cases the SDP can only include media agreed earlier by the UAC and
UAS.)

These options might be used for the following reasons in the example call
flow:
- 180 indicates that the ACM received included indication that the called
subscriber was free (and therefore alerting)
- 183 indicates that the ACM received did not indicate the status of the
callee
- Including SDP with port=0 indicates to the UAS to cease playing any media
and synthesise ringing
- Including SDP with port>0 indicates to the UAS to cease any local ringing
and play any arriving media
- Not including an SDP means the UAS should continue its current behaviour
regarding ringing or playing media

In the call flow above, the SDP in event #14 has a non-zero port number.
This has the effect of indicating to the UAC that it should continue to play
early media. Alternatively if we assume that in event #2 an SDP was included
in the 183 with port>0, the absence of SDP in #14 would have had the same
effect; i.e. that any early media arriving at the UAC would have continued
to be been played.

In this example call flow the caller at the UAC would have listened to early
media, carrying the sound of far end ringing from the PSTN between event #13
and #16/17.

Additional Issues arising:

1. The use of setting port numbers in SDP to 0 in order to indicate media
flow should cease is an IP specific solution and goes against the grain of
SIP being independent of the bearer protocol in use. This is a much wider
protocol issue.  Has any work been done on a generic method for indicating
media should stop being played?

2. In flow #14 above, the port number in the SDP may be set to 0 to indicate
to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it receives.  However, bis02
indicates that any SDP sent from a node refers to the media which that node
can receive.  Is it acceptable to use the backwards SDP (from UAS to UAC) to
indicate to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it is receiving or
is there a need for a new indication?

Any comments would be most welcome.

Many thanks

I hope the chairs (and Jonathan...) will excuse this non-technical
contribution, but I'm pleased to note that Jonathan Rosenberg
successfully defended his dissertation in the Electrical Engineering
Department at Columbia University today and is now (semi-officially) Dr.
Rosenberg. Well deserved.

Hi,

I've been looking in to some of the issues around supporting SIP behind a
NAT device, and would like to know if there are any formal discussions on
this list on the matter.  Can't find any in the archives.  If not - would
like to start the conversation:

There is the beginning of a trend I see in at least some vendors' SIP
clients to allow one to put the outside NAT ip address in the SIP headers
(contact, from, callID, eg), so the receiving station knows to whom to
reply.  While this works, it also breaks SIP connectivity if you're trying
to contact another SIP UA inside your firewall.  The simple fix seems to be
an algorithm on the SIP UA that says:

If pkt destined for inside NAT address
{	leave SIP headers alone

else

	replace contact address with outside NAT address is contact, from, callID,
etc fields
}

Has anyone looked at this, or know of any efforts to standardize a fix?

/dan

Also reposted, due to the fact that some parties (or, at least Chris)
apparently didn't receive it the first time:

This is a good question. As we discovered at the interrim meeting in Plano,
there are a lot of extremely complicated issues surrounding it.

In the interest of keeping the majority of us who can still claim
sanity sane, I'd *strongly* suggest postponing discussion of this
issue on the list until we blow through a few more of our work
items (http://www.greycouncil.com/sipwg/draftstatus/lc_calendar.html).

Subject: [SIP] Early Media using the manyfolks draft




Reposted due to mail problems - apologies to anyone who receives this message
twice.
Hi everyone,
I'd like to present the following for comment by the list:
Below is a proposal for handling some aspects of Early Media using both the
RFC2543bis-02 and the manyfolks draft for resource reservation. This proposal
could be applied in systems that will always use the manyfolks extension to
enable resource reservation, QoS, and security. An example application would be
the IMS in a 3GPP mobile network. In this example the need for Early Media
arises from interworking with the PSTN; specifically for:
- delivery of call progress tones and
- to prevent clipping of voice on answer.
My question is: Is this interpretation of how the manyfolks draft can be used
in combination with the RFC2543bis-02 acceptable?
Early Media & Manyfolks:
- "Manyfolks" discusses how network QoS and security establishment can be made
a precondition to sessions initiated by SIP, and described by SDP.
- It allows SDP to be sent inside 1xx provisional responses (other than 100)
and PRACKs.
- Note that from a standards point of view the SDP is not to be used to
negotiate media and codecs. The sender of an SDP is required to accept any of
the media/codecs it included.
- However, if a system level requirement is imposed that a single media type
and codec is to be used in both send and receive directions, negotiation to a
single choice of media and codec is effectively what happens.
Call flow:
In this call flow the UAS is acting as the signalling gateway to the PSTN. The
details of what is included in the SDP body is omitted here for simplicity, but
it is assumed that the necessary parameters are included to ensure that
establishment of QoS is mandatory in both directions as a precondition of the
call.

[Call now established. Rest of the call flow omitted]


SIP RFC2543bis02 draft offers a number of options for event #14. The UAS can
send any of the following to the UAC at this stage:
1. 180 with SDP, port=0 means called party alerting, play local ringing
2. 180 with SDP, port>0 means called party alerting, play media
3. 183 with SDP, port=0 means address complete, play local ringing
4. 183 with SDP, port>0 means address complete, play media
5. 180 without SDP means called party alerting, continue existing behaviour
6. 183 without SDP means address complete, continue existing behaviour
(In all cases the SDP can only include media agreed earlier by the UAC and
UAS.)
These options might be used for the following reasons in the example call flow:
- 180 indicates that the ACM received included indication that the called
subscriber was free (and therefore alerting)
- 183 indicates that the ACM received did not indicate the status of the callee
- Including SDP with port=0 indicates to the UAS to cease playing any media and
synthesise ringing
- Including SDP with port>0 indicates to the UAS to cease any local ringing and
play any arriving media
- Not including an SDP means the UAS should continue its current behaviour
regarding ringing or playing media
In the call flow above, the SDP in event #14 has a non-zero port number. This
has the effect of indicating to the UAC that it should continue to play early
media. Alternatively if we assume that in event #2 an SDP was included in the
183 with port>0, the absence of SDP in #14 would have had the same effect; i.e.
that any early media arriving at the UAC would have continued to be been
played.
In this example call flow the caller at the UAC would have listened to early
media, carrying the sound of far end ringing from the PSTN between event #13
and #16/17.
Additional Issues arising:
1. The use of setting port numbers in SDP to 0 in order to indicate media flow
should cease is an IP specific solution and goes against the grain of SIP being
independent of the bearer protocol in use. This is a much wider protocol issue.
Has any work been done on a generic method for indicating media should stop
being played?
2. In flow #14 above, the port number in the SDP may be set to 0 to indicate to
the UAC to stop playing any early media that it receives.  However, bis02
indicates that any SDP sent from a node refers to the media which that node can
receive.  Is it acceptable to use the backwards SDP (from UAS to UAC) to
indicate to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it is receiving or is
there a need for a new indication?
Any comments would be most welcome.

A motivation section and examples of functionality that require this
extension are conspicuously lacking in the current draft. Adding them may
help me understand why this draft is needed in the first place.

Hi Igor,

As I presented at the December 2000 IETF, the I-D is motivated by several
PSTN/SIP internetworking scenarios including:
Multiple diversions.
Diverting a call to an E.164 service.
Configuration issues (moving policy configuration to edges (UAs))

An ultimately called UAS can use the Diversion headers to implement a local
policy for his particular service.  For example, to answer the question:
Into which voice mailbox should a message be placed?  It's important to
understand that this is a policy decision; and as such should be
configurable at the ultimate edge of the voice network (i.e. move the smarts
to the edges).  The examples in section 9 do cover some of these issues.

Because there are some typos in the draft that need to get published, we'll
go ahead and release the -02 version.  However, we'll work on improving the
motivation scenarios for an -03 version.

thanks for your help,
Bryan

Hi.
 
I think that there is one thing that should be stated here very clearly about the Controller/B2B-UA.
 
That is a session setup between users1 and user2 using the Controller will have two different call-id's
compared to an ordinary session setup directly from user1 to user2, which would hold the very same
call-id.
 
This provides the ''controller'' with the ability to manipulate each call-leg separately at a later 
state like after an external timer expires in the middle of an established session.
 
With kind regards, Michael Junge Pedersen.

the 3pcc controller can also be thought of as a back-to-back UA.....ie. 2 UAs in the same logical entity.  It terminates the signaling, but the media goes between points A & B.  it will need to be call-stateful, like a UA.

hi all,

i have a douth regarding the 3pcc in sip.

i am clear that this is possible with the help of the controller.

like it is what which will take care of the signalling and the medai will be transfer will be taking place among them selves "true" i.e

A-------------CONTROLLER---------------------------B

  direct media transfer

===================================



ok but i am not claer about this entity controller can any one make me clear likw what is ?

if this is a different entity it should also be showm in the architecture of sip

like sipua,proxy,rediect,CONTROLLER....

so i am clear with me douth can anu one help me

Hi Igor,

It may help you if you get to take a look at some of the presentations from
the SIP Summit held last week in Dallas. The diversion header was mentioned
by a number of the presenters as a way of assisting in network
interoperability and helping enable enhanced services.

Any chance someone can point us at the presentations mentioned below ?

I thought that the Diversion draft had been dropped - the list at
http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/draftstatus/sip-draftstatus.html indicates
'General dissent at IETF49'.

Nevertheless, I would agree with a requirement to deal with the case where
calls encounter diversion before entering the SIP network (i.e. in another
network). Calls which encounter diversion within the SIP network will use
the existing SIP mechanisms - redirect, REFER etc., but if the diversion
happens before the SIP network ...

Provision of any identity information associated with the diverting party,
though, would need to meet the same privacy and authenticity requirements as
any other identity information as described in the privacy draft. Any future
Diversion proposals should look at using the capabilities defined there,
rather than adding a new header for this information.

Hmm, these are not really supported by PSTN. Just as your draft says, the
only information available in ISDN parameters are the called party and the
redirecting number. Nowhere does PSTN remember all the previous redirections
like suggested by the draft.

> Diverting a call to an E.164 service.

What services is Diversion header required for? There are lots of obscure
parameters in PSTN signaling; replicating all of them in SIP does not sound
like a very good idea and is not necessary for internetworking.

I find examples in section 9 rather farfetched. No company is ever going to
have SIP addresses that look like sip:pizza@p1.isp.com (when was the last
time you saw a real company with an email account at aol.com?)
Realistically, the night service calls you mentioned will be redirected to
something like pizza@nightservice.com or roses@nightservice.com.

I don't think we have reached consensus on this thread.

The fundamental problem is that the session timer draft does not adequately
address the potential smurf attack by a rouge UAC or proxy.  

Two solutions have been proposed:

1) Jonathan proposes defining a minimum value for session timer, with all
requests containing a smaller value being rejected.  

2) Dean, and others, propose that we make it a policy decision for each
entity in the SIP network to determine what is a reasonable minimum.

In an effort to come to closure on this question, I would propose the
following be added to the session timer draft:

1) A method for a proxy or UAS to reject a session timer request because the
session timer value is too small.  This is needed for both approaches, so
should not be controversial.  I would propose that we use the 488 response
with a reason phrase of Session Timer Too Small (or something similar).  I
would also propose that the session-expires header be used in this response
to indicate the minimal acceptable session timer value.  (Note: I'm trying
to reuse an existing response instead of creating a new one.  We can
certainly create a new one, if there is consensus to do so).

2) We change the session-expires header to only support delta times with a
granularity of minutes.  I think there is consensus that session-expires
values of less than one minute are not needed.  

3) We add stronger wording in the security section of the draft describing
the smurf attack that Jonathan is worried about.  As part of the wording, we
add the statement that entities supporting session timer SHOULD support a
minimum time of n minutes.  I propose we take Jonathan's suggestion and make
n = 30.  The obvious difference here is that Jonathan's suggestion becomes a
SHOULD instead of a MUST.

Thoughts?

I don't see the need for this. While I think it really only
makes sense to use delta values, for consistency I would allow
both forms. Not allowing the absolute form doesn't help solve
the smurf attack; disallowing small delta values does.

A recommended value of 30 minutes is fine. Making it a SHOULD seems
slightly too strong. Having the 488 response allows a UA to adapt
to the networks desire for longer session timers.

Hi
    Contact header is a request header. So it won't appear in response.

Right now, the spec is inconsistent. It calls it a response header, but as
currently specified, it can be present in a REGISTER, which would make it a
general header.

My proposed resolution was to deprecate its usage in REGISTER. The reason is
that its another special case, and there are no defined semantics about what
to do when you get it in a request.

Hi Ranjit,

rfc2543bis-02 says that contact header is a general header and not a contact
header.
Section 6.15 of the drafts says that the UAS MUST  insert a contact response
header
to indicate where it is reachable for future SIP requests.

Yes, that's exactly what this means - Contact is mandatory in 2xx responses
to INVITEs.

Deepak,

ya I agree with you, contact is a general header. My mistake.
and it appears in INVITE, OPTIONS , BYE and 2XX.

Hi Ranjit,

rfc2543bis-02 says that contact header is a general header and not a contact
header.
Section 6.15 of the drafts says that the UAS MUST  insert a contact response
header
to indicate where it is reachable for future SIP requests.

Hi
    Contact header is a request header. So it won't appear in response.

In the bis 02 draft, on page 37, table 4


Header field         where  proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG

 Contact               2xx          -   -   -   m   o   o


Does this mean that when a UAS responds 2xx to an INVITE
that a Contact header is mandatory?  If not, what does this
mean?

That is the preferred response, yes.

The server can do whatever it likes. However, a subscription is different
from a call. In many cases, if you get a re-invite for a call that you don't
know about, you want to terminate the call on the other side. However, if
you get a subscription refresh you don't know about, reinstating the
subscription is probably more desirable. So, the processing may depend on
the method.

So long as your server never loses state for active "sessions" of any sort
(subscriptions, calls), there are no problems rejecting all requests with a
tag in the To field.

Use the system clock.

No. The clock is used to generate the initial timestamp. Subsequent values
increment by one from the initial, independent of the time. The result is
that you could only recover from a reboot if you recreate the call N seconds
after it started, where N is the number of requests that were sent since the
call was established. This might possibly be a problem, although I suspect
it will never be one in practice. 

In any case, the whole bit about recovering from crashes really belongs in
an extension, which I am currently preparing. I think the spec should simply
say that the initial CSeq value can be computed in many different ways, and
that the only requirement is that the initial value be less than 2**31.

Actually, as the Diversion I-D points out, most ISUP and ISDN variants support
up to 2 redirecting numbers.  Could you point out the part of the Diversion
I-D that led you to believe there could be only one?  We'd need to clarify that
section.

The Diversion I-D is focused on answering 2 questions for the (ultimately)
called user agent:
From whom was the call diverted?
Why was the call diverted?

Implementations of services such as voicemail and night service frequently
require this information.

The example shows translation of a generic keyword (pizza) into a specific URL
as determined by the policy of the "carrier".  Today's web brower
"carriers" already exhibit this type of behavior today.  Try typing "pizza" in
your web browser...  I wouldn't be surprised if the topmost hits weren't
somehow compensating the web browser "carrier".  I'd imagine that tomorrow's
VoIP carriers could base some business models off of this idea.

Again, please also see the attached example below.  Perhaps it will seem more
realistic.

The Diversion header is merely providing supplementary information that cannot
always be found in any other parts of the SIP PDU.  Implementors of some
services (including voicemail and nightservice) need a consistent
(standardized) mechanism to retrieve this supplementary information so that
they can apply policy decisions to it to affect their service logic.  The
Diversion header provides such a mechanism and does so without creating a
configuration burden on system administrators of intermediate gateway/routing
nodes.

thanks again for your help,
Bryan

In the following ladder diagram, a call is placed from the PSTN to 5551234 which hangs
off of the 555xxxx PBX.  The Call Forward No Answer (CFNA) timer expires in the PBX, and
the PBX diverts the call to the user's admin/secretary at 5551001.  The secretary's phone
is busy, so the PBX diverts the call through the local PSTN/SIP gateway and SIP proxy
to the voicemail service with which the enterprise has contracted, in this case a
SIP voicemail service.  The SIP proxy performs an (ENUM) lookup of 9231000 which
resolves to 3.3.3.3.

When the call reaches the voicemail server, the message may be deposited into a voice mailbox
for 5551234, 5551000, or both depending on the policy configured at the voicemail service.

In addition, in practice one would normally encounter scenarios where the SIP proxy is owned
by a carrier and the voicemail server by a third party.  In this example, usage of the Diversion
header allows voicemail service policy to be changed (by the voicemail provider) without requiring
changes in the carrier's equipment.

Hi Everybody!

We are looking for a 'Gateway' to be used between SIP and PSTN. 
This Gateway will be used in a pure IPv6 environment. Therefore, 
the Gateway must be able to support IPv6.

Any information about this Gateway (source) will be highly 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

My comments are almost the same as Sean's.

>>1) A method for a proxy or UAS to reject a session timer
>>request because the session timer value is too small.  This is needed for both
>>approaches, so should not be controversial.  I would propose that we use the
>>488 response with a reason phrase of Session Timer Too Small (or something
>>similar).  I would also propose that the session-expires header be used in
>>this response to indicate the minimal acceptable session timer value.
>>(Note: I'm trying to reuse an existing response instead of creating a new one.  We can
>>certainly create a new one, if there is consensus to do so).
> 
>This seems ideal.

[Christer]: I agree. I would like to add a specific 4xx response code
for this, though, instead of having to read the reason phrase.
  
>>3) We add stronger wording in the security section of the
>>draft describing the smurf attack that Jonathan is worried about.  As part of
>>the wording, we add the statement that entities supporting session timer
>>SHOULD support a minimum time of n minutes.  I propose we take Jonathan's
>>suggestion and make n = 30.  The obvious difference here is that Jonathan's
>>suggestion becomes a SHOULD instead of a MUST.
>
>A recommended value of 30 minutes is fine. Making it a SHOULD seems
>slightly too strong. Having the 488 response allows a UA to adapt
>to the networks desire for longer session timers.

I agree. I would even argue that a recommended specific timer value
(e.g. 30 minutes) is too "strong", because what data do we have to "back
up" that value? The proper value is depending on so many things (network
architecture, transport protocol, number of nodes, network reliability,
node reliability, network size, distance between nodes etc etc etc etc
etc), so I would rather describe how the session-timer shall be used,
and why a relatively high value shall be used ( 30 minutes can be given
as an EXAMPLE instead of a RECOMMENDATION). This is just a smaill
detail, though, so we should not spend too much time arguing about it.

Can a REFER transaction occur before the INVITE that initiated the call is
completed?  For example:

      UA2 continues with REFER...

hi,
i'm trying to implement SIP proxy server, i have 
few questions and hope to get the answeres 
ASAP :)
1) when ever a INVITE request comes to the 
proxy, first should it check for whether the 
user is registered for the proxy?

if so.. the user should also get registerd in 
all the proxies the mesage gets routed?

2)How the billing is implemented in a proxy?

3) I guess its always two proxies that is 
required to establish a session... is that true? 
if not kindly explain.

4) how exactly the message gets routed to its 
destination ( i.e. how the proxy comes to know 
destination IP address..etc)?

thanks in advance :)

 Hi, 
              
When reading the rfc2543bis, I understand that there is a theorical difference between the concept of call and the concept of call-leg. But, concretely, I can't see any example where you could have several call-legs belonging to the same call. 
Do you have any idea conflicting with this? 
              
Fred,

A pair of drafts have been submitted recently
concerning inter-domain AAA for SIP IP comm
sessions. This work is intended to supply
additional infrastructure to support wide-
spread and general use of SIP, including
support for policy management and billable
services.

Messages have been posted to the SIP-AAA
list with a small amount of support but
not many comments otherwise.

1) Is the SIP WG too busy now to give
   time to this type of work?

2) Is the SIPPING WG not officially started
   yet? Any forecasts about when it will start
   and begin to take on work items?

Thanks!
Gery

Hi,
   I was reading an article in which It was mentioned that "mobile IP
doesnot provide means of device independent personal mobility and
location service" - Can somebody put some light on this statement
as to how SIP supports it.

Regards
Anupama

There has been an increase in double posting to
sip and sip-implementors.  If you reply to a message
from the clueless, please double check to make sure
your answer is directed to the correct list only:
	sip-implementors for current sip issues
	sip for new developments in sip

Most of the offending questions belong on 
sip-implementors only.

There is discussion within the IESG and the SIP/SIPPING chairs
about where AAA discussions belong.  This has not been
settled, and in fact is one of the hang-ups in getting
SIPPING officially underway.  We are working on it.

There WILL be a place to discuss these issues.

While I agree that session timer should not be used for billing, I'm not
sure we want to get into the business of listing all of the things that
extensions should not be used for.  However, I will add some words into the
early sections of the document.  I propose the following:

"Note that use of SIP messages, even with the session timer extension,
should not be considered sufficient to determine the existence of sessions.
Rogue user agents can continue media sessions even after BYE messages are
exchanged.  As such, the session timer extension should not be considered as
a fix to SIP that enables reliable usage billing."

I will strive to make it more consistent.  However, any where that a
MUST|SHOULD|MAY|ect appears should be considered normative.  Please let me
know if there are specific instances where use of the normative language in
the earlier sections of the document is not consistent with the protocol
description section.

It is a little more straight forward to specify it this way.  The added
overhead of having the UAC to the refreshes should not be enough to worry
about.  It is true that it can work in other ways, but I would like to
restrain from making changes to procedures that work, given that this draft
is pretty mature and there are likely to be implementations out there that
follow the current definition.

Then the re-INVITE is not a session refresh and has no effect on an existing
session timer request.  There is no requirement to include the
session-expires header on all re-INVITEs.  I will add the following wording
to the draft:

"While it will generally be more efficient for supporting UAs to include the
session-timer header in all re-INVITEs associated with a timed session, it
is not required.  Re-INVITEs during a timed session that are sent for
reasons other than refreshing the session time are allowed to not contain
the session-timer header.  The existing session timer is not changed if a
re-INVITE is received without a session-timer header."

I think this has already been addressed by other responses (date header...).

I agree.  This is addressed in my response to Jonathan's proposal.

I think Adam has already addressed this in a previous response.

The session doesn't exist until the INVITE transaction completes,
so at best UA1 would treat that REFER as an out-of-session REFER.
If the REFER had the tags UA2 planned to place in the INVITE, it
would get 481'ed. 

Why would UA2 ever want to do this?

Subject: RE: [SIP] First cut review of Session Timer draft


Hi all, 

I also have a few first cut comments on the draft for the last-call(for
which Rakesh has just made the WG announcement). I've followed Ben's
formatting convention and also use " " to indicate exact text
references/proposals:

3:4 - In the middle of the paragraph, there is a statement: 
" To make  sure the UAC is aware it must 
actually do them, the UAS MUST add a Require header to the 200 class 
response, with the tag "timer", when the request contains a Require 
header with tag "timer". " 

--> The last clause of the sentence should be... 
" when the request contains a Supported header with tag "timer". " 

SRD> Agreed, change made.

9:1 (Section 5) Propose that the statement "In general, proxies which ask
for session timers will record-route, since they won't receive refresheds if
they don't." be changed to something a bit stronger (i.e. a bold
RECOMMENDATION) such as: 

"It is RECOMMENDED that the proxy include the record-route header if it
wants to receive the refreshes." 

SRD> I'm not sure I see the value of changing the wording.  It has the same
effect either way.  Anyone implementing a well behaving proxy will
understand the need to record-route.  We have no control over badly behaving
proxies...

12:Table 3 - (minor formatting) Propose line spacing between table entries.
It can be a bit difficult to read since the Behavior spans multiple lines.
Another suggestion would be to have the entries in the same order in which
the scenarios were discussed in the preceeding paragraphs.  

SRD> I'll look into this...

In addition I have a couple more general recommendations on the Session
Timer one of which is in line with Ben's recommendation about a strong
statement on NOT to use Session Timer for billing. 

- Per the recent thread on the use of Session Timer for Pre-paid (you can
view this as a billing variant, but I see it more as a Service or
Application requiring a general purpose timing mechanism), I would suggest
adding a statement along the lines as follows just before the NAT/firewall
control paragraph on page 2:

"The Session Timer SHOULD NOT be used for service implementations (e.g.
Billing, Pre-paid, etc.).  Session Timer is not a general purpose network
timing mechanism, but is more specific to being able to free up resources
for some pathological scenarios.  Indeed, the Session Timer could be viewed
as much more of a network "maintenance" mechanism than a general purpose
network timer primitive mechanism." 

SRD> Well, I'm not sure I would characterize all uses of session timer as
pathological. :) I'm not comfortable with putting wording as strong as you
propose into the draft.  There is already wording indicating the purpose of
the extension that should be sufficient.  

- 2:5 In addition, I would suggest at a minimum to "soften" the endorsement
of session timer for NAT/Firewall control.  One suggestion would be
rewording the paragraph to be:

"Another possible application of the session timer may be in NAT and
firewall control."  

In line with this suggestion, I would think since the referenced draft is
still an ongoing project of the WG that it may not be prudent to include
this reference in this document going forward.  

SRD> It will be necessary to do this for the draft to advance to an RFC.

A more radical suggestion would be to remove the NAT and firewall paragraph
altogether.  The NAT/firewall draft references Session Timer and I think
that would be sufficient (i.e the circular references are unnecessary). In
additon, my view would be that if any potential application of the Session
Timer were discussed further in this draft, it would be the use for the
recovery mechanism to accomplish soft stated SIP sessions (referenced page
2, paragraph 3),  Particularly since this is the substantiation given for
using INVITES rather than a lighter weight mechansim such as the INFO ping
(which reduces end to end messaging and simplifies the processing for the
mechanism).   

SRD> All good suggestions, but I'm not sure it will significantly improve
the overall quality of the draft.  The NAT/firewall discussion is in there
as one example use of the extension.  While it is true that there are other
uses that could be included to motivate the need for the extension, making
these kinds of changes to an already pretty mature draft will just length
the time necessary to get it promoted to RFC.

Subject: [SIP] First cut review of Session Timer draft. 


Here are my first cut comments on session-timer for the upcoming last-call. 
Most of these are minor comments. Please forgive me if I am re-opening old 
discussions, as I did not follow the original session-timer work. 
Comments referring to specific parts of the document are prefixed with 
(page:paragraph) 
Global - We might need language (perhaps in security considerations) that 
recommends against using session-timer for billing purposes with out 
additional corroboration. I can imagine a theft-of-service attack where the 
UAs collude in letting the session expire, but maintain the RTP session. Any

proxy in the middle would assume the call was over. This will not work if 
the timer controls a firewall, but it could if the timer was only used to 
establish end-of-call for billing purposes. 
Global - (nit) there are several sections where the normative language is 
not clear. For example, it often says "X does Y" instead of "X MUST|MAY|etc 
do Y." Most of these are in the early descriptions, so perhaps the intent is

to reserve normative language for the specific behavior descriptions later 
in the draft. If that is so, then it is not consistent. 
3:2-A proxy can lower but not increase the expiration time. Jonathan brought

up the issue of a DoS attack using insanely small expirations. If a proxy 
cannot increase the expiration, it at least needs the option of rejecting 
requests with expiration values below a threshold. 
3:4 - (Typo) Sentence "They UAS MAY..." should read "The UAS MAY..." 
3:4 - (Minor) I am not sure I see the value in pushing responsibility back 
to a supporting UAC, if the UAC did not request the timer in the first 
place. Why not just let the UAS deal with it, if the UAS is the element that

wishes to use a timer? At least it might make sense to say that the UAS must

insert the Required header IF it wishes the UAC to handle the re-invites. 
4:5  What happens if the UAC does _NOT_ include a Session-Expires header on 
the re-invite? I assume everyone resets their timers with the original 
values? Or does timer processing cease? 
5:2 - Doesn't option of absolute time imply an assumption that all elements 
have their clocks reasonably synchronized? 
5:3 - Again, we need to allow elements to reject expirations below a 
configured threshold. 
10:2 - How can a proxy know that it is the closes proxy to the UAC that 
cares about the timer? Except in the trivial case where the proxy is the 
closest to the UAC period, this seems problematic.

No, the timer is not effected.  I have added wording to make this clear.

3:1 - "Any entity that inserts 
       a Session-Expires header with an absolute time MUST also insert a 
       Date header into the message. This ensures proper operation for 
       devices that do not have access to absolute time." 

Perhaps this sentance doesn't have enough hoopla about it, since 
I've had to point it out numerous times to different people. To those 
of you who have overlooked it (or even those you who haven't): do you 
have any suggestions about how to make it stand out more? Does it need 
better proximity to the paragraph explictly allowing absolute times 
(in section 5)? 

SRD> I have made it a paragraph of it's own (in the same place).  Hopefully
this will make it stand out.

Because the *first* proxy that cares will *add* a "Session-Expires" 
header. Other proxies will merely notice (and occasionally 
adjust) it. So, if you see no "Session-Expires," you're the first node 
that cares. If you don't, you aren't. 

A clarification to this effect would probably be useful... 

SRD> It's already there, in 10:2 - "...For the proxy closest to the UAS, the
final response to the \INVITE does not contain a Session-Expires header..."

Subject: [SIP] need some info abt SIP proxy


hi,
i'm trying to implement SIP proxy server, i have
few questions and hope to get the answeres
ASAP :)
1) when ever a INVITE request comes to the
proxy, first should it check for whether the
user is registered for the proxy?

the user does not register with proxy but registers with registrar.
say if u have both registrar and proxy residing in same machine then u can
say user registers with proxy.

if so.. the user should also get registerd in
all the proxies the mesage gets routed?

proxies do the routing

2)How the billing is implemented in a proxy?



3) I guess its always two proxies that is
required to establish a session... is that true?
if not kindly explain.

i don't think proxies establish any sessions. It will be thw user agents
that will establish sessions.

4) how exactly the message gets routed to its
destination ( i.e. how the proxy comes to know
destination IP address..etc)?

may be proxy could use location service ( location servers) to find the
location of the UAS.

thanks in advance :)

I just hope that folks designing SIP software will avoid the design
mistakes made by email software vendors.

Just imagine calls to every one in your address book, at 2 am...

Don't worry.  The mailing list software was smart enough to delete it.

##  not all devices (such as SIP-GW) will register.  Proxies should also be 
able to handle INVITE messages from devices that are not registered.  The 
logic by which they decide to "trust" that end-point is implementation 
specific.

>2)How the billing is implemented in a proxy?

##  billing or accounting?  accounting could be done based on having 
Record-Route enable and creating Start & Stop records on the 200OK and 
BYE.  Billing is beyond the scope of SIP as it involves formatting the 
records, rate-tarrifs, etc..

##  btw - it's not mandated that the SIP Proxy even do accounting, in fact 
many in the industry believe that it should not be done for IP to IP calls 
(no PSTN involved) and only done at the SIP-GW where it touches the 
PSTN.  this is mostly a religious argument, but there is nothing in the 
protocol which prevents you from doing accounting in either place or both.

##  a session can be directly established between two UAs.  Proxies provide 
a routing function.

##  Location-Server is one "function" and this is implemented differently 
by different people.  In essence, you're asking how should you find the 
thing that knows about where a user is.  This could be ENUM, a 
Subscriber-DB (Oracle, SQL, etc..) a Redirect-Server fronting a 
Least-Cost-Routing engine, etc..

Absolutely.  Please see the attached presentation of the Diversion I-D.

As I recall, the SIP WG chairs pressured the SIP WG to not accept
additional work items.  Presentations such as the Diversion I-D were
given 3 minute slots to briefly touch on new draft ideas.  There was not
time for discussion of the drafts and any discussion which was started
was abruptly cut off by the SIP WG chairs.  Therefore, I'd definitely
say that the softarmor site is overstating the WG reaction.

Right, I've yet to see an approach ala RFC3708 that provides the desired
information to the called user agent service without requiring extensive
called user agent service-specific policy configuration in the carrier's
gateways/nodes.  Such an approach leaves the door open for namespace
collisions (when separate carrier customers' have collisions in local
customer policy namespaces).  Further, imagine trying to interop domains
using different syntactical conventions ala RFC3708.  You would have to
install translation proxies just to re-write the Request-URI according
to local domain naming conventions.

All of this mess can be avoided by supporting Diversion.

Interesting idea...  we'd thought about taking a header hiding approach
early on.  We'll have to consider privacy interaction further.

thanks for your help!

Oops, the opaque-uri approach was presented in RFC3087 (not RFC3807).&nbsp;
Darn my dyslexic fingers!&nbsp; Sorry for the confusion.

Absolutely.&nbsp; Please see the attached presentation of the Diversion
I-D.
<blockquote TYPE=CITE><font size=-1>I thought that the Diversion draft
had been dropped - the list at <a href="http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/draftstatus/sip-draftstatus.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/draftstatus/sip-draftstatus.html</a>
indicates 'General dissent at IETF49'.</font></blockquote>
As I recall, the SIP WG chairs pressured the SIP WG to not accept additional
work items.&nbsp; Presentations such as the Diversion I-D were given 3
minute slots to briefly touch on new draft ideas.&nbsp; There was not time
for discussion of the drafts and any discussion which was started was abruptly
cut off by the SIP WG chairs.&nbsp; Therefore, I'd definitely say that
the softarmor site is overstating the WG reaction.
<p><font size=-1>>Nevertheless, I would agree with a requirement to deal
with the case where calls encounter diversion before entering the SIP network
(i.e. in another network). >Calls which encounter diversion within the
SIP network will use the existing SIP mechanisms - redirect, REFER etc.,
but if the diversion happens before the SIP >network ...</font>
<p>Right, I've yet to see an approach ala RFC3087 that provides the desired
information to the called user agent service without requiring extensive
called user agent service-specific policy configuration in the carrier's
gateways/nodes.&nbsp; Such an approach leaves the door open for namespace
collisions (when separate carrier customers' have collisions in local customer
policy namespaces).&nbsp; Further, imagine trying to interop domains using
different syntactical conventions ala RFC3087.&nbsp; You would have to
install translation proxies just to re-write the Request-URI according
to local domain naming conventions.
<p>All of this mess can be avoided by supporting Diversion.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE><font size=-1>Provision of any identity information
associated with the diverting party, though, would need to meet the same
privacy and authenticity requirements as any other identity information
as described in the privacy draft. Any future Diversion proposals should
look at using the capabilities defined there, rather than adding a new
header for this information.</font></blockquote>
Interesting idea...&nbsp; we'd thought about taking a header hiding approach
early on.&nbsp; We'll have to consider privacy interaction further.
<p>thanks for your help!

As I recall, the SIP WG chairs pressured the SIP WG to not accept additional
work items.  Presentations such as the Diversion I-D were given 3 minute
slots to briefly touch on new draft ideas.  There was not time for
discussion of the drafts and any discussion which was started was abruptly
cut off by the SIP WG chairs.  Therefore, I'd definitely say that the
softarmor site is overstating the WG reaction.  
 
After each of the presentations, the room was asked for their reaction.  The
results on the site represent the chair's
determination of that reaction.  You can argue that the entire WG was not in
the room, you can argue that 
you did not get sufficient time to present the ideas.  You cannot argue that
we overstated the reaction.
At the time, the people in the meeting did not consider the draft very
interesting.
 
In the future, there will NOT be an opportunity to present a draft that has
not recieved significant positive
reaction ON THE LIST, or for which there are significant issues that could
be resolved on the list.
Not even 3 minutes.   
 
We have not officially rechartered, but when we do, there will also be an
attempt to stick to
the charter.  So the process (always has been, but rarely enforced):
 
1. Raise new ideas on the list, or write an I-D and start discussion on the
list.
2. Chairs will rule on the list if the item is out of charter
3. If significant positive reaction is determined on the list, keep going,
        move the discussion along, revise the I-D, ...
4. If issues arise that need face time in a meeting, ask for a slot.
                Don't summarize the idea, just the state you are in and the
                issue(s) that must be resolved
 
                Present all the ideas on the table
 
                Propose a resolution
5. When the I-D is getting solid, ask that it be put on the "last call
calendar"
6. Follow through until WGLC is reached and passed.

In draft-ietf-sip-service-examples-01...

2.9  3-way Conference
   User A calls User B, User B then invites user C to
a 3-way call. User B will mix the audio streams (act
as the conference bridge).  If user B drops out of the
call then the entire call is dropped.  This is not   
a fully meshed conference, and does not make use of
the concepts in the call control draft......

>>>Question: What does it mean about "User B will mix
the audio streams (act as the conference bridge)."? 

Thanks.

Sachin,

I can answer some of your questions.
See remarks inline preceded with [gwg].

[gwg] If the INVITE uses an alias for the destination
the proxy must be able to map the alias to the
destination or to another proxy that will move the
INVITE toward the destination. If a destination
IP address is supplied in the INVITE, a SIP proxy
is not necessarily needed, unless for other reasons
aside from alias mappings (such as AAA, including
billing records).

Generally, users register an alias with a proxy.
In these cases, when an INVITE comes in, the SIP
proxy checks registration records to map the
alias used in the INVITE with the destination IP
address.

[gwg] Billing requires authentication and accounting
records (two of the As in AAA). This is not
standardized by SIP. Efforts are under way to
define mechanisms to support billing with SIP.
See

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gross-sipaq-01.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gross-cops-sip-01.txt

[gwg] Not always (see answer to 1), but I think
that is the typical scenario. To support billable
services, it is a requirement that each endpoint
be represented by a SIP proxy for session authorization,
authentication and so that accounting records
get accurately generated and forwarded to the correct
entities.

Last paragraph page 12 draft-ietf-sip-session-timer-04:
"Note that if the 200 OK to the re-INVITE has 
no Session-Expires, no expiration time exists for the 
session.  This can happen if the proxies and/or UAS 
change their mind about session timers, and decide 
they no longer wish to use them."

Please continue to require this renegotiation of
Session-Expires stuff in all re-INVITE combinations
for the following reasons.
1) A revived proxy can be aware of Session-Expires value.
2) A revived UAS that was required to perform session 
   extensions will know it needs to do so.
3) It allows the session timing to be 
   discontinued and the call still remain.
4) It requires the smurf that required small timer 
   values to stay in the picture if they want to 
   continue to require small values.

Now this discussion seems to have died down, can I ask Jonathan to summarise
the final changes as a result of the discussion....starting the with the
requested changed to harmonise the status-code name through the
specification.

I think we should also look at the 100-rel draft, which defines the PRACK
method. 

This contains the following statement in 6.2

   A PRACK request MUST NOT be cancelled. If a UAS receives a CANCEL
   request for a PRACK, it MUST respond to the CANCEL with a 405 (Method
   Not Allowed).

Aside from the fact that the first sentence is a repetition of the UAC
requirement that already exists in section 6.1, and it is therefore
inappropriate to repeat the MUST NOT here where we are specifying
requirements for the UAS, the second sentence would appear to be
unnecessarily inconsistent with other requirements relating to CANCEL. 

I guess the answer here depends on whether we are assuming finite processing
time for these things or not. In most cases the 200 OK for a PRACK will be
sent immediately, therefore a CANCEL will not be able to get in. If a CANCEL
really can get in, can anybody elaborate why it is dangerous to cancel the
PRACK like any other method. 

In any case, as the 405 response seems primarily to tell the sender what
methods are allowed, presumably it must indicate that CANCEL (whose support
is mandatory by all UACs) is an allowed method in the Allowed header field,
thereby telling the sender that he cannot use CANCEL because CANCEL is an
allowed method!!!!

The 100rel requirement appears is inconsistent with the rest of the CANCEL
handling, and I cannot see the danger in making it consistent.

thanks

I was looking for the normative specification of this 0.0.0.0 in the SDP c
line. The RFC does not specify it, and the service examples mentions it but
this is informational. Given that the interpretation of this particular c=
line would appear to be not to send data, then I would judge thsi requires
some statement in a standards track SDP specification.

Have I missed it somewhere?

We also need a change to the service-examples draft to change the text that
states that either party may take the session off hold, as you have
indicated that is wrong.

Brett,

You're correct, I had forgotten that was there.  This just shows that the
session timer draft has been hanging around too long and needs to be
promoted to RFC.

Thanks for pointing this out.

User B will be receiving the audio streams from User A and C. User B will
have two RTP sessions active one with A and another one with C. It's User
B's job to mix the audio streams from A and C along with its own and send it
back the mixed steams to A and C.

I guess n -1 mixing can be done here.

A + B ====> C
A + C ====> B
B + C ====> A

note that, here since it's not a fully meshed conference so only User B's
media component would be doing the mixing job and A and C would be dealing
with just on RTP session.

Hope it answers your question.

Hi,
   In the  draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-02(Nov 2000), in the section 13.1.1
describing the End -to -End Encryption,
   it refers to enc. column in Table 4,5 for the specification of headers
which must not be encrypted.
   But, the Table4 and Table 5 don't seem to have that column at all.

  The RFC 2543(March 1999) has this column.
  Can I know,why was this removed in  the bis-02?

I would agree with this.

A typical proxy does not know anything about PRACK, and thus
would not know that it cannot CANCEL one.  Since CANCEL
provides a neat way, in general, to try and cleanup state on
transactions, it would be a shame if a proxy was violating
some effectively unknown rule.

However, that said, CANCEL doesn't seem useful for non-INVITEs
(unless they enfore very quick completion of transactions),
unless (perhaps) the request is forked.  And we know that
forking of non-INVITEs is typically undesirable.  So it's
difficult.

Thoughts?

One proposal: "CANCEL can only be used to terminate an INVITE request".
Short and simple :)

Another idea would be to include Proxy-Require: 100rel, if the UAC knows
it may want to CANCEL a PRACK, but I don't know if that is a very good
think to do...

hi,

excuse me if my question is naive, as i am new to sip. i think that a little more clarification as to what really is UAS and UAC, before we start talking about INVITE in the bis02 document. the document, has come way ahead of the original RFC, i agree, but the order in which the concepts, acronyms and ideas are presented, may not be the best. the roles of UAS and UAC need to be clarified before we talk about INVITE and the idea of when/why the SessionDescription MAY/SHOULD be sent, from/to UAS/UAC, respectively. i am talking about section 4.2.1

if this forum is not proper for this question, can somebody direct me to the correct one.

thanks,
iv.

Hi
    I have a query related to back to back UA  i.e the controller. So is it
that controller's job is only call signaling part and not media?
    and will controller be a seperate entity . or could it be a part of
proxy server?

Putting media streams on hold isn't a generally applicable
SDP feature (e.g. it would make no sense in, say, a multicast
of a space shuttle launch); it's something SIP needs to
define in the context of multimedia. So, you won't find it
in any SDP drafts.

The normative text you're looking for is in appendix B of
the bis-02 draft, which describes SIP's *usage* of SDP. In
particular, look at section B.6.

The main thing I am looking for is that we come up with a consistent rule
that means that anybody specifying a new method does not have to write their
own set of rules - the rules will be in the bis draft.

Both Adam's (and others) approach (allowed only on methods where the final
response is not immediate), and the current bis approach (allowed on all
methods whether it is useful or not) can be drafted as a consistent set of
rules, and at the end of the day, I do not mind which we get. 

Having agreed that set of rules, we can (should) then remove all information
relating to CANCEL from the various extension drafts, and maybe even write
such a statement in the guidelines document for authors of future
extensions, safe in the knowledge that there is no scope for
misinterpretation amongst implementors (well some days we can be optimistic
:-) ).

True, only signalling. However he may need to know the SDP
getting relayed across.

Controller does not have to be in the proxy. Its a very good way
to manipulate conferencing, and media server calls, so it can reside
on a separate entity which controls conferencing say.

However the proxy may impelement this function too.

Reusing 488 is fine, but the current bis definition 
only reflects that SDP is the problem instead of 
potentially the headers.

Reusing Session-Expires in the 488 is fine, but it 
would potentially cause confusion with the fact 
that currently Session-Expires in a negative response 
will still reset session timer.  [However as I've 
mentioned previously, I wish negative response 
couldn't extend sessions since a proxy could have 
generated the negative response instead of the UAS.]

Keeping granularity in seconds is fine with me.  
I'm more concerned about the minimum Session-Expires 
value.

I prefer that Session-Expires MUST NOT be less than 
2 minutes.  This helps accommodate for the retries of 
200 and INVITE over UDP to get the session extended.  
I'd actually prefer a higher value, but I assume 
that some would be uncomfortable with the 
"MUST NOT" part of the text if the value was higher.  

In addition to the MUST NOT be less than 2 minutes, 
I prefer the draft state that Session-Expires 
SHOULD NOT be less 30 minutes for SIP messaging 
that traverses a public network.

Based on the recommendation of sending refreshers 
after 1/2 Session-Expires, the Session-Expires 
triggered re-INVITEs MUST NOT occur more often 
than every minute and SHOULD NOT occur more often 
than every 15 minutes.

It might also be beneficial to mention in the draft
that support of the Session-Expires can lead to 
more re-INVITE collisions, especially if the 
Session-Expires value is small.

Hi Folks,
   A question for everyone::

If I have an m= line in the "final" SDP that has a set of payload types,
(i.e. after the 200/ACK) then I understand that this means that I am
ready to accept, on this port, RTP packets containing any of the
payload types listed on the m= line.

For example...
m=audio 3456 RTP/AVP 97 96 0 15

I don't believe that it's MANDATORY to have a single payload type
per m= line at the end of an INVITE/1xx/2xx/ACK set up. Am I correct,
or missing something (more than normal, that is)?

All the best,
     Lawrence

	Title		: Guidelines for specifying SCTP-based media transport 
                          using SDP
	Author(s)	: R. Fairlie-Cuninghame
	Filename	: draft-fairlie-mmusic-sdp-sctp-00.txt
	Pages		: 18
	Date		: 10-May-01
	
This document describes a set of guidelines for using the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) to specify media transport using the
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fairlie-mmusic-sdp-sctp-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-fairlie-mmusic-sdp-sctp-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-fairlie-mmusic-sdp-sctp-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

        Another nit.  This contradicts with the text in 11.3:

                                                Pekka

11.3 Caller Receives Response to Initial Request

   Multiple responses may arrive at the UAC for a single INVITE request,
   due to a forking proxy. Each response is distinguished by the "tag"
   parameter in the To header field, and each represents a distinct call
   leg. The caller MAY choose to acknowledge or terminate the call with
   each responding UAS. To acknowledge, it sends an ACK request, and to
   terminate it sends a BYE request.  The To header field in the ACK or
   BYE MUST be the same as the To field in the 200 response, including
   any tag. The From header field MUST be the same as the From header
   field in the 200 (OK) response, including any tag.

also, it's NOT a very good etiquette to "cross-post" to too many groups, who have well-defined focus and area of work.

In draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-04.txt section 3.1.1 Successful Simple SIP to SIP:

User B uses the same tag value (tag=8321234356) for the 'To' field (in its response) and then for the 'From' field
when it initiates the 'Bye' transaction.

Bis02 section 6.26 says: "The UA SHOULD use different tags for From and To header fields"

Am I missing something here?
Thanks,

Uri

According Bis section 11.4:

"Regardless of whether the caller or callee is generating the new request, the header fields in the request are set as follows. For the desired call leg, the To header field is set to the remote address, and the From header field is set to the local address (both including any tags)"

So does that explain why User B has reused the To-Tag as From-Tag in its subsequent request?
It does make sense, if that it is the explanation, since User A knows User B by the To-Tag, so when it gets the same tag in the From field it knows what instance of user B it came from. 

Is that so?

What would you say about the following sequence, which has been built based on the above assumption and based on the call-flows draft (note the '???' at the last line)

A -> B (Request1): FromTag='fa'; ToTag=null 
B -> A (200 response): FromTag='fa'; ToTag='tb'
A -> B (subsequent request): FromTag='fa'; ToTag=null
B -> A (subsequent request): FromTag='tb'; ToTag=null
A -> B (200 response): FromTag='tb'; ToTag='ta'
A -> B (subsequent request): FromTag='fa or tb???'; ToTag=null

Uri,

A tag is associated with a URL, so when the To and From URLs are swapped, so are the tags.  Once the tags are added, they are used throughout the session and become part of the call leg that uniquely identifies the call.  If a tag is dropped in a request (as in your example, see below),
the call leg no longer matches, and the UAS will reply with a 481 Call leg does not exist.

Thanks,
Alan Johnston

From now on, every request and response should contain the two tags, fa and tb.

The response to this request would be a 481 since to tag inserted by B is not present.

Likewise, this request would receive a 481

These two are also not correct.

In the split of work between SIP and SIPPING, the call-auth draft was
allocated to the SIPPING group. As a result of discussion, it now appears to
be allocated to the SIP group, as is correct as it contains SIP extensions.

In the move however, all details seem to be missing from the calendar on the
SIP WG supplemental pages. Can the WG chairs elighten us as to the envisaged
dates for this.

Alan

1. Thanks for the quick response!
2. Could you please take the 6 steps sequence I sent you and populate it with correct values from the point is starts to get wrong.
3. I will clarify my question again: Since truly the tags shall be viewed as identifiers of a specific UA instance (along with its URL), does a UA need to have/maintain  A PAIR OF TWO SEPARATE tags, one that he uses in From field and the other for To field, or it may use the same ONE tag value??? Are there different situations, which may affect it? (i.e. if a UA has initiated a session and identified itself with a tag in the From field (say 'fa'). Then later on throughout the session it needs to respond to a request coming from a/the other UA, shall it use than for the To field the same tag it was using before for the For filed ('fa')?

Uri,

A tag is associated with a URL, so when the To and From URLs are swapped, so are the tags.  Once the tags are added, they are used throughout the session and become part of the call leg that uniquely identifies the call.  If a tag is dropped in a request (as in your example, see below),
the call leg no longer matches, and the UAS will reply with a 481 Call leg does not exist.

Thanks,

From now on, every request and response should contain the two tags, fa and tb.

The response to this request would be a 481 since to tag inserted by B is not present.

Likewise, this request would receive a 481

These two are also not correct.

1. Is it true that with or without regard to branch IDs, a forking proxy
needs to keep a list of network addresses of forked destinations, so it
knows where to send consecutive requests such as Cancel or ACK to?
2. If the answer to (1) is YES, then is it true that the Branch ID is just
an elegant (application layer) way to refer to the branches, i.e., if it was
not there a forking proxy would have still known to tell one branch from
another by their network addresses?
3. I am not suggesting there is any redundancy here, I just like to make
sure I got it right.

I suggest you look at the stage 2 documents for ISDN (Q.84.2through5 from
memory - its somewhere around there anyway). You will find that the
originating exchange receives all information about each forwarding hop
(step by step as it occurs). 

The forwarded to exchange gets the original and last forwarding numbers.

Whether these are presented to the end user depends on the wishes of the
calling and forwarding users.

You are correct. In fact, with more endpoints beginning
to support 2833, it's the usual case.

Hi Folks,
   A question for everyone::

If I have an m= line in the "final" SDP that has a set of payload types,
(i.e. after the 200/ACK) then I understand that this means that I am
ready to accept, on this port, RTP packets containing any of the
payload types listed on the m= line.

For example...
m=audio 3456 RTP/AVP 97 96 0 15

I don't believe that it's MANDATORY to have a single payload type
per m= line at the end of an INVITE/1xx/2xx/ACK set up. Am I correct,
or missing something (more than normal, that is)?

All the best,
     Lawrence

I think this has become more of a "sip-implementors" type of question.

Hi,

Can someone tell me what the current status of early media handling
in SIP is. draft-ietf-sip-183-00.txt has been expired for a while.
Digging through the mailing list, the last reference I found was that
the work from this draft was disbandoned and that a new early media
approach would be worked out (see mail I added to this).

The 2543bis is not very clear with respect to early media.
Section 7.1 says that if a 1xx response contains a session
description, a UAC SHOULD cease generating local ringback
tone. It does not say what it should do instead. Does SDP
in a 1xx mean that there is early media?

Section 8.1 says that 1xx responses MAY contain session
description and that the interpretation of the body depends
on the status code. Where can I find this interpretation?

It says that generally it informs the caller what kind of
session the callee is likely to establish, subject to later
modification in the 2xx response. If a UAS doesn't want to
modify it, can it send a 2xx without SDP? In my opinion
that should be fine, but 2543bis says 2xx responses to INVITE
requests contain session descriptions.

Regards,
Michel

There was quite a discussion of this subject at the IETF. One opinion is
that early media is in fact a form of session set-up, and that we should
not have 25 different ways to set-up a session. That means, there should
be no media at all until a 250/ACK exchange. Indeed, this could ease
firewall traversal a lot.

The bis currently reflects that the WWW-Authenticate 
header can only be in requests and 401 responses.
Can the WWW-Authenticate header be passed within a 
2xx response (updating nonce) to hopefully avoid 
some extra 401's during subsequent 
registrations/requests directed to the same 
registrar/UAS?

The bis currently reflects that Proxy-Authenticate 
can only be in 401 and 407.  Can the Proxy-Authenticate 
header be passed within a 2xx response (updating nonce) 
to hopefully avoid some extra 401/407's for subsequent
requests/calls through an outbound proxies?

Any comments or pointers to email threads where 
this has been previously discussed?

I don't understand the concern.  This does not force a BYE to happen faster.
It might cause a re-INVITE to happen quicker, which is why we are adding
wording about not accepting small session-timer values.

We can't mandate that all UAs support tags.  We have added wording that any
UA implementing the session timer draft must support From and To tags.

No.

The way to avoid the extra 401s is to cache the credentials, and resubmit
them for any subsequent requests to the same URI. In other words, you don't
wait for a 401 to insert an Authorization header. Each request for the same
URI contains any Authorization header sent previously to that same URI. The
nonce may have become stale, in which case the request will generate a 401
which effectively refreshes the nonce.

Same as above.

Well, I've got a bunch of issues with this draft. So, lets take it from the
top.

Firstly, we have a process problem. There are now many implementations of
this extension, many of them under the apparent belief that this is going to
be an IETF standard.  Indeed, there is an I-D, which is being actively
maintained. However, it is not a work item of sipping or sip. To my
knowledge, there has not been consensus to move forward with CC-Diversion on
the standards track. According to the notes from IETF-49, there was only
"medium interest", for whatever thats worth. It doesn't have the
draft-ietf-sip-* name. Unfortunately, many other drafts don't have that
title, and yet they are on the standards track.  And thats the problem.

Just because something is submitted to IETF as an I-D, and maintained, does
not mean it is on the standards track, either through the working group, or
individually (and I'll note that very few individual drafts get approved on
the standards track). In fact, a very small fraction of the drafts submitted
ever see standards track. Unfortunately, the SIP group has not done a good
job of helping the community distinguish between documents on the standards
track, and those not on the standards track. The right way to do this is
that all standards track documents are draft-ietf-sip-*. If something new
comes up that people want to make standard, we get it on the charter, and
then rev the doc with a draft-ietf-sip-* name. Before that happens, the
document is NOT ON THE STANDARDS TRACK.

This process problem is not the fault of this draft, but the draft appears
to have brought it forward.

My second problem is the subtle implications this has with backwards
compatibility and interoperability with ISDN/ISUP systems, particularly
voicemail systems. The Diversion header is clearly just the SIP
reincarnation of the existing redirecting number from ISDN and ISUP. That,
of course, facilitates interoperability with ISDN/ISUP. However, it means
that gateways may not properly set the redirecting number in ISUP/ISDN in
the absence of the Diversion header. Similarly, SIP-enabled systems that
look for the Diversion header to define services may not function properly
in the absence of Diversion. As a result of that, Diversion basically
becomes mandatory for these to work. Unfortunately, this appears to have
occurred in some implementations and deployments already. Since proxies are
the ones that insert Diversion, this means that Diversion would require a
Proxy-Require header to function. In fact, its far more insidious than that.
A UAC would need to insert a Proxy-Require in each and every request, not
because the UAC wants a service, but because the call might possibly,
someday, hit a downstream system which uses Diversion. 

Extensions that need Proxy-Require to function are effectively non-backwards
compatible extensions. See draft-ietf-sip-guidelines on why its very, very
bad. May as well call them another protocol, since they are not compatible
with baseline SIP.

Now, this problem is fixable. As Allison has mentioned during IETF 50, all
extensions henceforth MUST describe how backwards compatibility operates.
Therefore, the draft MUST describe how gateways, voicemail servers, and
anything else that looks at Diversion, would work in its absence. 

However, the issue with Proxy-Require is related to an architectural
assumption which I strongly disagree with. The underlying architectural
assumption is that applications on behalf of user A will execute on some
system far downstream from user A. These applications depend on data known
to the proxy that serves A, and therefore this data must be passed to the
application. The Diversion header exists to propagate this information. This
is effectively a centralized service architecture. In a more distributed
system, if I want an application to run on behalf of user A, I run it at the
server which serves user A.

Let me be concrete, with an example. Lets take the interesting scenario
where user X calls boss B. Boss B is not available, so the call gets
forwarded to the secretary S. The secretary is S also not available, so the
call is forwarded to voicemail. An application on the voicemail server,
executing on behalf of boss B and secretary S, determines that the the
voicemail for the boss, not the secretary, should be dropped. Now, if I
assume that this application exists in the voicemail server, downstream from
the caller, then of course some kind of information on this diversion must
be passed to the server.

However, no new extension is needed if a more distributed approach is taken.
When the call reaches the proxy for B, the application for B resides there.
It proxies the call to the proxy for S, and sets the Request-Disposition
header to redirect. The proxy for S runs an application on behalf of the
secretary. This application forwards to voicemail if the secretary is
unavailable. Because of the Request-Disposition, the call is redirected to
voicemail rather than being proxied. This moves control for the call back to
the boss, B. The bosses application decides instead to forward the call to
the boss's voicemail, and so proxies the call to a URI corresponding to the
voicemail drop for the boss. This works just fine, and requires no new
extensions.

Another spin on this is to view it as a feature interaction problem. The
boss wants to forward to his secretary if he is there, otherwise to his own
voicemail if the secretary is not available. The secretary wants to forward
the call to his voicemail if he's not available. These two features are
contradictory, and thus interact with each other. Since the secretary and
boss are served by (potentially) separate proxies, we have a classic MUMC
(multiple-user, multiple-component) interaction. The Diversion approach is
to assume that we can reconcile all these interactions by somehow having
"policy" at the endpoint server. This policy knows what the right
reconciliation is for all potential interactions, assuming it has all the
data it needs. To obtain this data (here, the set of diversions), the data
is passed from the proxies along the path to the application. My concern is
this "magical" assumption that policy on the server will know the right
thing to do in order to reconcile all feature interactions.

Rather than take this approach, a more robust feature interaction approach
is to let the feature for the boss, and the feature for the secretary, run
independently. The feature for the boss runs on the boss's proxy (or
application server). The feature for the secretary runs on the secretary's
proxy (or application server). The two applications know nothing about each
other, and run independently. The bosses application runs first. It "wins"
the feature interaction if it maintains control of the call. The secretary's
application "wins" if it keeps control of the call after the boss forwards
it. As a result, the reconciliation between the features is determined by
the ordering of the invocation of these two, and the flow of control between
them. This is the approach proposed by modern feature interaction systems,
such as Distributed Feature Composition (DFC) and ECLIPSE, and the recent
I-D on SERL [draft-steenfeldt-sip-serl-fwr-00.txt]. All of these are based
on the well-known "cascaded" approach to feature interaction in the IN. Its
also the same as the approach I proposed above using Request-Disposition.
There are many advantages to this approach. It does not require passing
additional information to third party components to perform feature
interaction reconciliation. As a result, there are no security risks (since
no information is divulged), as there are with the Diversion approach.
Managing the feature interactions is easy. As new users are added, we don't
need to program a single system with the interactions between that user's
features, and the features of existing users, as we do in the Diversion
approach. We do not need an extension, since no new information is being
passed between applications. The diversion approach requires an extension.

This distributed approach is also the one advocated by rfc3087, and by
draft-rosenberg-sip-app-components. RFC3087 talked about access to SIP
voicemail features, using the request URI as a service identifier.

So, my point here is that Diversion is needed only under a very specific
architectural model. This model has well known feature interaction
complications, which are resolved readily in a more distributed model.
Furthermore, the distributed approach is more secure and requires no
extension. 

Onto the next issue.

I believe the point was made that Diversion simplifies PSTN
interoperability. If a request has been diverted in the PSTN, we can carry
the PSTN diversion information in SIP in the Diversion headers. This way, we
can design SIP enabled systems that provide servers to PSTN endpoints,
without loss of information. However, we've talked about this issue for a
long time. The SIP group has already decided that instead of defining each
ISUP/ISDN header as a SIP header, we will encapsulate these PSTN messages as
bodies, and use SIP-T. That means we can still build SIP enabled systems
that provide services to PSTN users, without loss of information, yet we can
avoid replicating each ISUP header into SIP. 

OK, now to some nitty gritty issues I have with Diversion. It says that the
proxies only insert the Diversion header when the call is diverted, which is
defined as:

diversion:      A change to the ultimate destination endpoint
                    of a request.  A change in the Request-URI of a
                    request that was not caused by a routing decision.
                    This is also sometimes called a deflection or
redirection.
A diversion can occur when the "user" portion of the
                    Request-URI is changed for a reason other than
                    expansion or translation.

Now, I would be really impressed if someone can tell me how to program a
proxy to know the difference between a routing decision that changes the
ultimate destination, and one that does not. In SIP, we make no distinction
between the two. So, effectively, every single proxy or redirect operation
will require the insertion of this Diversion header. This means another set
of stacked headers, of exactly the same length as the Via headers. That
significant overhead, and its additional processing. Furthermore, every
proxy would need to do it for each and every call, since they don't know
whether the ultimate recipient will need to make use of Diversion to provide
some services. 

The final concern I have is a "slippery slope" argument. Effectively,
Diversion is about encapsulating a routing decision made at point A, and
sending it to a downstream device. Right now, Diversion handles routing
decisions such as call-forward-no-answer, call-forward-busy, unconditional,
and so on. However, in practice, the logic for a call diversion can be
arbitrarily complex. What if its some complex CPL script that caused the
diversion? How do I represent that kind of logic? Where do we draw the line?
The problem is avoided by not trying to transfer this kind of information in
the first place. If an application requires routing information on proxy A
to function, then the application runs at A.

Hi Michel,

While I can't help you with the status of the "early media" draft I can have
a go at answering a number of your other questions. I have been looking at
early media within SIP networks for some time now and recently sent an email
to the list (see attached email below).  The email describes a method for
achieving "early media" using bis02 and the "manyfolks" QoS draft.  It
discusses most of the issues you have raised including the issue of whether
or not 183 Session progress responses and 180 Ringing responses should or
should not contain SDP (and whether any meaning should be attached to this).


With respect to the issue of whether or not 2xx responses should contain SDP
even if the UAS does not want to modify the session it is my understanding
of 2543bis02 that SDP is always included in the 2xx response - I suppose
that if the UAS does not want to modify the session (as already agreed from
SDP in provisional responses) then it just re-sends the same SDP it sent in
its' last provisional response.  	Indeed there are actually a number
of situations whereby the UAS would wish to change the SDP in a 2xx response
even if all resources had already been negotiated and reserved as a result
of SDP within the INVITE and 1xx responses.  An example of this situation is
when the called party answers a call. The called party UAS sends a 200 final
response to the callers' UAC.  This 200 response must be able to alter the
media path between caller and callee from "recv only behaviour" (i.e. callee
UAS not listening - receiving port set to zero) to "send and recv behaviour"
(i.e. callee UAS is listening - receiving port no set to non-zero) (NOTE: At
all times the connection/media path is always "sendrecv" - it's just that
the callees' UAS can choose not to listen to incoming media hence implying
"recv only" behaviour).  Such behaviour is required in order to prevent the
caller from being able to talk to the callee during call set up (during
which time the call is not billed).

Any comments on the proposed "early media" call flow would be welcome.

Cheers

Subject:	[SIP] Early Media using the manyfolks draft



Hi everyone, 

I'd like to present the following for comment by the list: 

Below is a proposal for handling some aspects of Early Media using both the
RFC2543bis-02 and the manyfolks draft for resource reservation. This
proposal could be applied in systems that will always use the manyfolks
extension to enable resource reservation, QoS, and security. An example
application would be the IMS in a 3GPP mobile network. In this example the
need for Early Media arises from interworking with the PSTN; specifically
for:

- delivery of call progress tones and 
- to prevent clipping of voice on answer. 

My question is: Is this interpretation of how the manyfolks draft can be
used in combination with the RFC2543bis-02 acceptable?

Early Media & Manyfolks: 

- "Manyfolks" discusses how network QoS and security establishment can be
made a precondition to sessions initiated by SIP, and described by SDP.

- It allows SDP to be sent inside 1xx provisional responses (other than 100)
and PRACKs. 
- Note that from a standards point of view the SDP is not to be used to
negotiate media and codecs. The sender of an SDP is required to accept any
of the media/codecs it included.

- However, if a system level requirement is imposed that a single media type
and codec is to be used in both send and receive directions, negotiation to
a single choice of media and codec is effectively what happens.

Call flow: 

In this call flow the UAS is acting as the signalling gateway to the PSTN.
The details of what is included in the SDP body is omitted here for
simplicity, but it is assumed that the necessary parameters are included to
ensure that establishment of QoS is mandatory in both directions as a
precondition of the call.

[Call now established. Rest of the call flow omitted] 


SIP RFC2543bis02 draft offers a number of options for event #14. The UAS can
send any of the following to the UAC at this stage:

1. 180 with SDP, port=0 means called party alerting, play local ringing 
2. 180 with SDP, port>0 means called party alerting, play media 
3. 183 with SDP, port=0 means address complete, play local ringing 
4. 183 with SDP, port>0 means address complete, play media 
5. 180 without SDP means called party alerting, continue existing behaviour 
6. 183 without SDP means address complete, continue existing behaviour 
(In all cases the SDP can only include media agreed earlier by the UAC and
UAS.) 

These options might be used for the following reasons in the example call
flow: 
- 180 indicates that the ACM received included indication that the called
subscriber was free (and therefore alerting) 
- 183 indicates that the ACM received did not indicate the status of the
callee 
- Including SDP with port=0 indicates to the UAS to cease playing any media
and synthesise ringing 
- Including SDP with port>0 indicates to the UAS to cease any local ringing
and play any arriving media 
- Not including an SDP means the UAS should continue its current behaviour
regarding ringing or playing media 

In the call flow above, the SDP in event #14 has a non-zero port number.
This has the effect of indicating to the UAC that it should continue to play
early media. Alternatively if we assume that in event #2 an SDP was included
in the 183 with port>0, the absence of SDP in #14 would have had the same
effect; i.e. that any early media arriving at the UAC would have continued
to be been played.

In this example call flow the caller at the UAC would have listened to early
media, carrying the sound of far end ringing from the PSTN between event #13
and #16/17.

Additional Issues arising: 

1. The use of setting port numbers in SDP to 0 in order to indicate media
flow should cease is an IP specific solution and goes against the grain of
SIP being independent of the bearer protocol in use. This is a much wider
protocol issue.  Has any work been done on a generic method for indicating
media should stop being played?

2. In flow #14 above, the port number in the SDP may be set to 0 to indicate
to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it receives.  However, bis02
indicates that any SDP sent from a node refers to the media which that node
can receive.  Is it acceptable to use the backwards SDP (from UAS to UAC) to
indicate to the UAC to stop playing any early media that it is receiving or
is there a need for a new indication?

Any comments would be most welcome.

Subject: [SIP] Early media


Hi,

Can someone tell me what the current status of early media handling
in SIP is. draft-ietf-sip-183-00.txt has been expired for a while.
Digging through the mailing list, the last reference I found was that
the work from this draft was disbandoned and that a new early media
approach would be worked out (see mail I added to this).

The 2543bis is not very clear with respect to early media.
Section 7.1 says that if a 1xx response contains a session
description, a UAC SHOULD cease generating local ringback
tone. It does not say what it should do instead. Does SDP
in a 1xx mean that there is early media?

Section 8.1 says that 1xx responses MAY contain session
description and that the interpretation of the body depends
on the status code. Where can I find this interpretation?

It says that generally it informs the caller what kind of
session the callee is likely to establish, subject to later
modification in the 2xx response. If a UAS doesn't want to
modify it, can it send a 2xx without SDP? In my opinion
that should be fine, but 2543bis says 2xx responses to INVITE
requests contain session descriptions.

Regards,
Michel

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi Michel,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>While I can't help you with the status of the =
&quot;early media&quot; draft I can have a go at answering a number of =
your other questions. I have been looking at early media within SIP =
networks for some time now and recently sent an email to the list (see =
attached email below).&nbsp; The email describes a method for achieving =
&quot;early media&quot; using bis02 and the &quot;manyfolks&quot; QoS =
draft.&nbsp; It discusses most of the issues you have raised including =
the issue of whether or not 183 Session progress responses and 180 =
Ringing responses should or should not contain SDP (and whether any =
meaning should be attached to this).&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>With respect to the issue of whether or not 2xx =
responses should contain SDP even if the UAS does not want to modify =
the session it is my understanding of 2543bis02 that SDP is always =
included in the 2xx response - I suppose that if the UAS does not want =
to modify the session (as already agreed from SDP in provisional =
responses) then it just re-sends the same SDP it sent in its' last =
provisional response.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed there =
are actually a number of situations whereby the UAS would wish to =
change the SDP in a 2xx response even if all resources had already been =
negotiated and reserved as a result of SDP within the INVITE and 1xx =
responses.&nbsp; An example of this situation is when the called party =
answers a call. The called party UAS sends a 200 final response to the =
callers' UAC.&nbsp; This 200 response must be able to alter the media =
path between caller and callee from &quot;recv only behaviour&quot; =
(i.e. callee UAS not listening - receiving port set to zero) to =
&quot;send and recv behaviour&quot; (i.e. callee UAS is listening - =
receiving port no set to non-zero) (NOTE: At all times the =
connection/media path is always &quot;sendrecv&quot; - it's just that =
the callees' UAS can choose not to listen to incoming media hence =
implying &quot;recv only&quot; behaviour).&nbsp; Such behaviour is =
required in order to prevent the caller from being able to talk to the =
callee during call set up (during which time the call is not =
billed).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Any comments on the proposed &quot;early media&quot; =
call flow would be welcome.</FONT>

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi everyone, </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I'd like to present the following for comment by the =
list: </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Below is a proposal for handling some aspects of =
Early Media using both the RFC2543bis-02 and the manyfolks draft for =
resource reservation. This proposal could be applied in systems that =
will always use the manyfolks extension to enable resource reservation, =
QoS, and security. An example application would be the IMS in a 3GPP =
mobile network. In this example the need for Early Media arises from =
interworking with the PSTN; specifically for:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- delivery of call progress tones and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>- to prevent clipping of voice on answer. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>My question is: Is this interpretation of how the =
manyfolks draft can be used in combination with the RFC2543bis-02 =
acceptable?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Early Media &amp; Manyfolks: </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- &quot;Manyfolks&quot; discusses how network QoS and =
security establishment can be made a precondition to sessions initiated =
by SIP, and described by SDP.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- It allows SDP to be sent inside 1xx provisional =
responses (other than 100) and PRACKs. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>- Note that from a standards point of view the SDP =
is not to be used to negotiate media and codecs. The sender of an SDP =
is required to accept any of the media/codecs it included.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- However, if a system level requirement is imposed =
that a single media type and codec is to be used in both send and =
receive directions, negotiation to a single choice of media and codec =
is effectively what happens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Call flow: </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In this call flow the UAS is acting as the signalling =
gateway to the PSTN. The details of what is included in the SDP body is =
omitted here for simplicity, but it is assumed that the necessary =
parameters are included to ensure that establishment of QoS is =
mandatory in both directions as a precondition of the call. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>These options might be used for the following reasons =

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In the call flow above, the SDP in event #14 has a =

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>1. The use of setting port numbers in SDP to 0 in =

being played?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>2. In flow #14 above, the port number in the SDP may =
be set to 0 to indicate to the UAC to stop playing any early media that =
it receives.&nbsp; However, bis02 indicates that any SDP sent from a =
node refers to the media which that node can receive.&nbsp; Is it =
acceptable to use the backwards SDP (from UAS to UAC) to indicate to =
the UAC to stop playing any early media that it is receiving or is =

But isn't the point here, that nonces ultimately do become stale, and must
at some point be refreshed in the 401s. Hence generating "extra" 401s,
sooner or later.

In my opinion, this is not entirely necessary. HTTP Authentication does
specify a header to be inserted to responses by the server, namely
Authentication-Info, which is used to convey next nonce as well as provide
for mutual authentication in HTTP.

It is beyond me, why this functionality wasn't originally copied to SIP; the
registration scenario at least is analogous to where Authentication-Info is
used in HTTP. Henning's current draft on registrations addresses this issue
shortly, but I really think that the Authentication-Info (and possibly
Proxy-Authentication-Info) header should be added to the bis draft.  

Old-school clients can always ignore the header and only pick up nonces from
401s. Or does this add some additional complexity, that I have missed? The
extra added value in Authentication-Info would then be mutual
authentication, i.e. the client authenticating the server, which can't be
done in current SIP. So isn't bringing these info headers to SIP worth
serious considering?

Of course, Proxy-Authentication-Info in SIP is tricky, since I guess it
would demand the authenticating server to Record-Route and be stateful. But
a registrar using Authentication-Info would be perfectly in-line with HTTP
Authentication.

BR,
Aki

I'll address the process problems.

Drafts which are sip wg items will, at the next rev after
they are accepted as work group items, be called draft-ietf-sip.
The rechartering process is still underway, but the sip
(as opposed to sipping) charter is posted, and the
drafts are listed.

Anyone can write a draft, submit it, and "announce" it to
the appropriate list.  Discussion can ensue.  The chairs
will rule pretty quickly if the draft is so far outside
the charter that it is inappropriate to continue on the list,
but in most cases, we will allow discussion to continue
for a while.

If the resulting discussion indicates that the level of 
interest is low, we will halt discussion on the list.
Authors are free to pursue the work on their own, creating
special lists, and announcing same on the sip list.
If the resulting discussion indicates that the level of
interest is high, the chairs will consider a request to
add the draft to the accepted items list.  The barrier
for entry is presently VERY high.  It may take discussion
at a meeting for such a move to be completed, or list
discussion may suffice.  Regardless, the process is that
the authors ask, the chairs rule.  If you don't ask,
it isn't a WG item.  AD participation in this process is
almost mandatory given the work load.  We aren't going to
add any item that could reasonably be done in another
group, or that seriously expands the charter.

WG items are tracked on the auxiliary web page.  Non items
are not tracked.  If it isn't on the tracking page, it
isn't a work item.  The "official" WG page is also updated
with accepted work items.

In this case, the authors have asked, and thus far, the chairs
have been not inclined to carry this item forward, but have
been allowing discussion to continue for a while.  Shortly,
we will have to decide if this is, or isn't appropriate.
As we said, the barrier is very high.  If you WANT this item
to move forward, get into the discussion.

Brian

To add (or probably just rephrase): In the voicemail case, leaving the
decision to the secretary's proxy is also not the right thing. How is
the secretary to know what to do? After all, there may well be cases
where the secretary *should* get the voicemail, since S may be the one
that can actually access it in time. Indeed, by infering intent from
route, I can get myself into the situation that I want to avoid talking
to B's voicemail (since I know B can't or won't pick it up) and instead
want to either get B directly or talk to S. If I rely on diversion, I
will inevitably end up in B's mailbox.

Thus, the mere indication of diversion provides insufficient clarity as
to the intent of the caller or any intermediate parties for further
handling of the request.

On the other hand, B's proxy can make this decision, since it's B's
call.

Thus, this is also an example of explicit vs. implicit. In the old phone
system, we could only express things implicitly ("because these things
happened, the caller must have meant to do X").

Also note that for the most common case, we already have the most
important information, namely the caller-intended destination, in the To
header.

[Christer]: I would still vote for a specific 4xx code. It is then
possible to specify specific actions, by nodes supporting the
session-timer, to be taken when it arrives, ie that the Session-Expires
header would have a special meaning.

[Christer] I am still against the MUST NOT for the time value. If we
define a 4xx (or if we use 488), with the Session-Expires header telling
the minimum value, there is no need to specify a minimum value in the
standard. It's then up to the operator/network provider to specify a
minimum value for his network, and configure the nodes to not accept any
value below that.

This can be achieved by using the combination of the 488 and the presence of

I agree.  The current plan is for the next revision of the draft to contain
that the session timer value SHOULD NOT be less than 30 minutes.

RFC 2617 defines Authentication-Info and Proxy-Authentication-Info response
headers for this purpose (a 'nextnonce' parameter) among other things.

Since bis now references 2617 rather than the older 2069 for authentication,
I imagine these headers are now incorporated by reference, even though
they're not explicitly mentioned in bis yet.

hi,

in the SIP FAQ (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/faq.cgi) the answer to "Q. What is the relationship between MGCP and SIP?" islepchin@dynamicsoft.com writes that "The details of combining the two in a system are still being fleshed out"...

is this still true, i mean are they still being fleshed out, or some document (draft maybe) is available to help with the interworking ?

thanks,
iv.

Jonathan,

If I understand correctly, you are arguing that wherever possible, services
should be designed so that they can get the mandatory information they need
from the Request-URI and the standard headers. This is consistent with the
meaning of URIs, which identify a particular abstract resource that is
required (i.e. particular voicemail *box*) rather than a device (i.e.
voicemail server).

This is a good point. However, as long as the entity asking for the service
is aware of the service it is asking for, it can include the appropriate
headers to access that service.

You also described two service architectures, with the example of User X
calling Boss B, being forwarded to Secretary S and subsequently to
voicemail. You argue that the service which decides to whose voicemail the
service should be forwarded to is associated with B, and so should reside
with B. So, the S sends a redirect request back to B, which B recognises as
a divert-to-voicemail. Then B decides which voicemail to divert to.

In this case too, though, the information needed by the voicemail platform
(namely, whose voicemail box?) is included in the INVITE sent to the
voicemail platform. Whether the information is encoded into the Request-URI
or the Diversion header seems to me unrelated to which 'service
architecture' is used.

So, I agree with your points about service architecture. The model you
describe below and in draft-rosenberg-sip-app-components is a good one.

I also agree with the point that where information is logically appropriate
for the Request-URI, then that is where it should go, not in a new header.
In the voicemail case, the abstract 'resource' which is indicated in the URI
is a particular *voicemail box* not a particular voicemail server (by
analogy, an HTTP URI identifies a document, service, whatever, not just a
server on which the resource resides).

However, I don't see why these two points are related.

So, using the Diversion header for voicemail is a bad idea because it
requires that the entity sending the call to voicemail needs to know that
the Diversion header is required. Or, put another way, a voicemail service
based on this can only be sold to users who have a proxy which can include
the Diversion header for them on calls it sends to voicemail. Mayby
voicemail platform vendors have a good reason for restricting their market
in this way.

On the other hand, a SIP voicemail platform owner who wishes to offer
service to PSTN endpoints, needs to make sure that the PSTN gateway(s) used
by their customers include the diverting number (=voicemail owners number)
in the SIP INVITE, whether it be in the Request-URI, in the Diversion header
or in the encapsulated ISUP IAM. The problem of ensuring that a capable
gateway is used is no easier if you choose one approach (encapsulation)
against another (Diversion).

To my mind, Diversion information is an example of the 'service capability'
approach - it is a generic capability which could be used for multiple
services. So, it's not sufficient anyway to demonstrate that it is a 'bad
idea for voicemail' to demonstrate that it is a bad idea full stop.

We will presumably define many service capabilities, upon which innovative
services can be built. It will always be the case that only users supporting
the underlying service capabilities can access the service. A UA which does
not support REFER cannot participate in a Call Transfer. The corollory is
that sensible service designers will only rely on service capabilities that
they absolutely do need. The Service Capabilities which are developed and
deployed on SIP UAs will be driven by the popularity of the Services which
rely on them.

To my mind, the capability to transport the identity of a 'diverting' user
is a useful service capability. At the very least it can be presented to the
eventual called user on a 'best effort' basis. Services which make use of
this capability have to be aware that it will not always be present, or the
Service can only be offered to users with the Capability. The presence of
the diverting identity would mean that the call had encountered some form of
Diversion, but the absence of this information would not mean that diversion
had not been encountered. To ensure that privacy is handled correctly with
respect to this information, I'd suggest using Remote-Party-ID to carry it.

The usefulness of explicit 'diversion reasons' is less clear, since in a SIP
network we are not restricted to the old PSTN/ISDN diversion reasons (busy,
no answer, universal, not reachable) - there could be as many diversion
reasons as there are CPL scripts, so such information could be simply a text
string.

dat e</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Jonathan,</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>If I understand correctly, you are arguing that =
wherever possible, services should be designed so that they can get the =
mandatory information they need from the Request-URI and the standard =
headers. This is consistent with the meaning of URIs, which identify a =
particular abstract resource that is required (i.e. particular =
voicemail *box*) rather than a device (i.e. voicemail =
server).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>This is a good point. However, as long as the entity =
asking for the service is aware of the service it is asking for, it can =
include the appropriate headers to access that service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>You also described two service architectures, with =
the example of User X calling Boss B, being forwarded to Secretary S =
and subsequently to voicemail. You argue that the service which decides =
to whose voicemail the service should be forwarded to is associated =
with B, and so should reside with B. So, the S sends a redirect request =
back to B, which B recognises as a divert-to-voicemail. Then B decides =
which voicemail to divert to.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In this case too, though, the information needed by =
the voicemail platform (namely, whose voicemail box?) is included in =
the INVITE sent to the voicemail platform. Whether the information is =
encoded into the Request-URI or the Diversion header seems to me =
unrelated to which 'service architecture' is used.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>So, I agree with your points about service =
architecture. The model you describe below and in =
draft-rosenberg-sip-app-components is a good one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I also agree with the point that where information is =
logically appropriate for the Request-URI, then that is where it should =
go, not in a new header. In the voicemail case, the abstract 'resource' =
which is indicated in the URI is a particular *voicemail box* not a =
particular voicemail server (by analogy, an HTTP URI identifies a =
document, service, whatever, not just a server on which the resource =
resides).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>However, I don't see why these two points are =
related.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>So, using the Diversion header for voicemail is a bad =
idea because it requires that the entity sending the call to voicemail =
needs to know that the Diversion header is required. Or, put another =
way, a voicemail service based on this can only be sold to users who =
have a proxy which can include the Diversion header for them on calls =
it sends to voicemail. Mayby voicemail platform vendors have a good =
reason for restricting their market in this way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>On the other hand, a SIP voicemail platform owner who =
wishes to offer service to PSTN endpoints, needs to make sure that the =
PSTN gateway(s) used by their customers include the diverting number =
(=3Dvoicemail owners number) in the SIP INVITE, whether it be in the =
Request-URI, in the Diversion header or in the encapsulated ISUP IAM. =
The problem of ensuring that a capable gateway is used is no easier if =
you choose one approach (encapsulation) against another =
(Diversion).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>To my mind, Diversion information is an example of =
the 'service capability' approach - it is a generic capability which =
could be used for multiple services. So, it's not sufficient anyway to =
demonstrate that it is a 'bad idea for voicemail' to demonstrate that =
it is a bad idea full stop.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>We will presumably define many service capabilities, =
upon which innovative services can be built. It will always be the case =
that only users supporting the underlying service capabilities can =
access the service. A UA which does not support REFER cannot =
participate in a Call Transfer. The corollory is that sensible service =
designers will only rely on service capabilities that they absolutely =
do need. The Service Capabilities which are developed and deployed on =
SIP UAs will be driven by the popularity of the Services which rely on =
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>To my mind, the capability to transport the identity =
of a 'diverting' user is a useful service capability. At the very least =
it can be presented to the eventual called user on a 'best effort' =
basis. Services which make use of this capability have to be aware that =
it will not always be present, or the Service can only be offered to =
users with the Capability. The presence of the diverting identity would =
mean that the call had encountered some form of Diversion, but the =
absence of this information would not mean that diversion had not been =
encountered. To ensure that privacy is handled correctly with respect =
to this information, I'd suggest using Remote-Party-ID to carry =
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The usefulness of explicit 'diversion reasons' is =
less clear, since in a SIP network we are not restricted to the old =
PSTN/ISDN diversion reasons (busy, no answer, universal, not reachable) =
- there could be as many diversion reasons as there are CPL scripts, so =
such information could be simply a text string.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Well, I've got a bunch of issues with this =
draft. So, lets </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; take it from the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; top.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Firstly, we have a process problem. There are =
now many </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; implementations of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; this extension, many of them under the apparent =
belief that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; this is going to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; be an IETF standard.&nbsp; Indeed, there is an =
I-D, which is being actively</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; maintained. However, it is not a work item of =
sipping or sip. To my</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; knowledge, there has not been consensus to move =
forward with </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; CC-Diversion on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the standards track. According to the notes =
from IETF-49, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; there was only</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;medium interest&quot;, for whatever thats =
worth. It doesn't have the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; draft-ietf-sip-* name. Unfortunately, many =
other drafts don't </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; have that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; title, and yet they are on the standards =
track.&nbsp; And thats </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the problem.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Just because something is submitted to IETF as =
an I-D, and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; maintained, does</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; not mean it is on the standards track, either =
through the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; working group, or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; individually (and I'll note that very few =
individual drafts </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; get approved on</FONT>

fraction of the </FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ever see standards track. Unfortunately, the =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; track, and those not on the standards track. =
The right way to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; do this is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that all standards track documents are =
draft-ietf-sip-*. If </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; something new</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; comes up that people want to make standard, we =
get it on the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; charter, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; then rev the doc with a draft-ietf-sip-* name. =
Before that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; happens, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; document is NOT ON THE STANDARDS TRACK.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; This process problem is not the fault of this =
draft, but the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; draft appears</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to have brought it forward.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; My second problem is the subtle implications =
this has with backwards</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; compatibility and interoperability with =
ISDN/ISUP systems, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; particularly</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail systems. The Diversion header is =
clearly just the SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; reincarnation of the existing redirecting =
number from ISDN </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and ISUP. That,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of course, facilitates interoperability with =
ISDN/ISUP. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; However, it means</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that gateways may not properly set the =
redirecting number in </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ISUP/ISDN in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the absence of the Diversion header. Similarly, =
SIP-enabled </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; systems that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; look for the Diversion header to define =
services may not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; function properly</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; in the absence of Diversion. As a result of =
that, Diversion basically</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; becomes mandatory for these to work. =
Unfortunately, this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; appears to have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; occurred in some implementations and =
deployments already. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Since proxies are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the ones that insert Diversion, this means that =
Diversion </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; would require a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Proxy-Require header to function. In fact, its =
far more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; insidious than that.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; A UAC would need to insert a Proxy-Require in =
each and every </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; request, not</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; because the UAC wants a service, but because =
the call might possibly,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; someday, hit a downstream system which uses =
Diversion. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Extensions that need Proxy-Require to function =
are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; effectively non-backwards</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; compatible extensions. See =
draft-ietf-sip-guidelines on why </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; its very, very</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; bad. May as well call them another protocol, =
since they are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; not compatible</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; with baseline SIP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Now, this problem is fixable. As Allison has =
mentioned during </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; IETF 50, all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; extensions henceforth MUST describe how =
backwards </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; compatibility operates.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Therefore, the draft MUST describe how =
gateways, voicemail </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; servers, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; anything else that looks at Diversion, would =
work in its absence. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; However, the issue with Proxy-Require is =
related to an architectural</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; assumption which I strongly disagree with. The =
underlying </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; architectural</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; assumption is that applications on behalf of =
user A will </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; execute on some</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; system far downstream from user A. These =
applications depend </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; on data known</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to the proxy that serves A, and therefore this =
data must be </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; passed to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; application. The Diversion header exists to =
propagate this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; information. This</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; is effectively a centralized service =
architecture. In a more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; distributed</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; system, if I want an application to run on =
behalf of user A, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I run it at the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; server which serves user A.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Let me be concrete, with an example. Lets take =
the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; interesting scenario</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; where user X calls boss B. Boss B is not =
available, so the call gets</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; forwarded to the secretary S. The secretary is =
S also not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; available, so the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; call is forwarded to voicemail. An application =
on the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail server,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; executing on behalf of boss B and secretary S, =
determines that the the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail for the boss, not the secretary, =
should be dropped. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Now, if I</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; assume that this application exists in the =
voicemail server, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; downstream from</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the caller, then of course some kind of =
information on this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; diversion must</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; be passed to the server.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; However, no new extension is needed if a more =
distributed </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; approach is taken.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; When the call reaches the proxy for B, the =
application for B </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; resides there.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; It proxies the call to the proxy for S, and =
sets the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Request-Disposition</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; header to redirect. The proxy for S runs an =
application on </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; behalf of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; secretary. This application forwards to =
voicemail if the secretary is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; unavailable. Because of the =
Request-Disposition, the call is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; redirected to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail rather than being proxied. This moves =
control for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the call back to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the boss, B. The bosses application decides =
instead to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; forward the call to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the boss's voicemail, and so proxies the call =
to a URI </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; corresponding to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail drop for the boss. This works just =
fine, and requires no new</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; extensions.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Another spin on this is to view it as a feature =
interaction </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; problem. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; boss wants to forward to his secretary if he is =
there, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; otherwise to his own</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail if the secretary is not available. =
The secretary </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; wants to forward</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the call to his voicemail if he's not =
available. These two </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; features are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; contradictory, and thus interact with each =
other. Since the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; secretary and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; boss are served by (potentially) separate =
proxies, we have a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; classic MUMC</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (multiple-user, multiple-component) =
interaction. The </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Diversion approach is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to assume that we can reconcile all these =
interactions by </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; somehow having</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;policy&quot; at the endpoint server. This =
policy knows what the right</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; reconciliation is for all potential =
interactions, assuming it </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; has all the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; data it needs. To obtain this data (here, the =
set of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; diversions), the data</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; is passed from the proxies along the path to =
the application. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; My concern is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; this &quot;magical&quot; assumption that policy =
on the server will know </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the right</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; thing to do in order to reconcile all feature =
interactions.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Rather than take this approach, a more robust =
feature </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; interaction approach</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; is to let the feature for the boss, and the =
feature for the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; secretary, run</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; independently. The feature for the boss runs on =
the boss's proxy (or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; application server). The feature for the =
secretary runs on </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the secretary's</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxy (or application server). The two =
applications know </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; nothing about each</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; other, and run independently. The bosses =
application runs </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; first. It &quot;wins&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the feature interaction if it maintains control =
of the call. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The secretary's</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; application &quot;wins&quot; if it keeps =
control of the call after the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; boss forwards</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; it. As a result, the reconciliation between the =
features is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; determined by</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the ordering of the invocation of these two, =
and the flow of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; control between</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; them. This is the approach proposed by modern =
feature </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; interaction systems,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; such as Distributed Feature Composition (DFC) =
and ECLIPSE, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and the recent</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I-D on SERL =
[draft-steenfeldt-sip-serl-fwr-00.txt]. All of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; these are based</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; on the well-known &quot;cascaded&quot; approach =
to feature interaction </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; in the IN. Its</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; also the same as the approach I proposed above =
using </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Request-Disposition.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; There are many advantages to this approach. It =
does not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; require passing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; additional information to third party =
components to perform feature</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; interaction reconciliation. As a result, there =
are no </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; security risks (since</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; no information is divulged), as there are with =
the Diversion approach.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Managing the feature interactions is easy. As =
new users are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; added, we don't</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; need to program a single system with the =
interactions between </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that user's</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; features, and the features of existing users, =
as we do in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Diversion</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; approach. We do not need an extension, since no =
new </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; information is being</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; passed between applications. The diversion =
approach requires </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; an extension.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; This distributed approach is also the one =
advocated by rfc3087, and by</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; draft-rosenberg-sip-app-components. RFC3087 =
talked about access to SIP</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; voicemail features, using the request URI as a =
service identifier.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; So, my point here is that Diversion is needed =
only under a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; very specific</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; architectural model. This model has well known =
feature interaction</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; complications, which are resolved readily in a =
more distributed model.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Furthermore, the distributed approach is more =
secure and requires no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; extension. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Onto the next issue.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; I believe the point was made that Diversion =
simplifies PSTN</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; interoperability. If a request has been =
diverted in the PSTN, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; we can carry</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the PSTN diversion information in SIP in the =
Diversion </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; headers. This way, we</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; can design SIP enabled systems that provide =
servers to PSTN endpoints,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; without loss of information. However, we've =
talked about this </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; issue for a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; long time. The SIP group has already decided =
that instead of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; defining each</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ISUP/ISDN header as a SIP header, we will =
encapsulate these </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; PSTN messages as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; bodies, and use SIP-T. That means we can still =
build SIP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; enabled systems</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; that provide services to PSTN users, without =
loss of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; information, yet we can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; avoid replicating each ISUP header into SIP. =
</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; OK, now to some nitty gritty issues I have with =
Diversion. It </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; says that the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxies only insert the Diversion header when =
the call is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; diverted, which is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; defined as:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; diversion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A =
change to the ultimate destination endpoint</FONT>
<BR><FONT =
SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a =
request.&nbsp; A change in the Request-URI of a</FONT>
<BR><FONT =
SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request =
that was not caused by a routing decision.</FONT>
<BR><FONT =
SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is =
also sometimes called a deflection or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; redirection.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; A diversion can occur when the &quot;user&quot; =
portion of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT =
SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
Request-URI is changed for a reason other than</FONT>
<BR><FONT =
SIZE=3D2>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expansion =
or translation.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Now, I would be really impressed if someone can =
tell me how </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to program a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxy to know the difference between a routing =
decision that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; changes the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ultimate destination, and one that does not. In =
SIP, we make </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; no distinction</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; between the two. So, effectively, every single =
proxy or </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; redirect operation</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; will require the insertion of this Diversion =
header. This </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; means another set</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of stacked headers, of exactly the same length =
as the Via </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; headers. That</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; significant overhead, and its additional =
processing. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Furthermore, every</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; proxy would need to do it for each and every =
call, since they </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; don't know</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; whether the ultimate recipient will need to =
make use of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Diversion to provide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; some services. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The final concern I have is a &quot;slippery =
slope&quot; argument. Effectively,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Diversion is about encapsulating a routing =
decision made at </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; point A, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; sending it to a downstream device. Right now, =
Diversion </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; handles routing</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; decisions such as call-forward-no-answer, =
call-forward-busy, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; unconditional,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and so on. However, in practice, the logic for =
a call diversion can be</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; arbitrarily complex. What if its some complex =
CPL script that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; caused the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; diversion? How do I represent that kind of =
logic? Where do we </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; draw the line?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; The problem is avoided by not trying to =
transfer this kind of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; information in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the first place. If an application requires =
routing </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; information on proxy A</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; to function, then the application runs at =
A.</FONT>

[My comment about getting a BYE triggered 
earlier was just an attempt to try and understand 
why proxies can add Session-Expires in negative 
responses.  If the proxy or UAS adds a small 
Session-Expires value that the UAC refuses 
or cannot extend, the UAC would send a BYE prior 
to its expiration.  
]

My main concern is with proxies not being 
explicitly discouraged from adding session 
extending Session-Expires to re-INVITE 
failure responses.

A--P1--P2--B

A call has been set up; P1 and P2 have 
record-routed; and A is required to send 
session extending re-invites to B.  
A sends re-invite.  P1 returns a 503 
because it is too busy.  P1 SHOULD NOT 
return Session-Expires extending the 
session since P2 and B would still be 
timing off the previous Session-Expires.

Same situation however P2 and B do not support 
the timer draft.  P1 previously observed 
that P2 and B do not support the timer draft 
since they didn't return the Session-Expires 
in the 200.  A sends re-INVITE.  P2 returns
503 because it is too busy.  P1 SHOULD NOT
add the Session-Expires to the 503 because
it has no clue if B is still alive.

Same situation however only B does not 
support the timer draft.  A sends a re-INVITE.  
B returns a negative response.  P2 SHOULD NOT 
add the Session-Expires because P2 has no clue 
as to the state of the call-leg's related 
session at B.

What impact does the addition of the 
Session-Expires SHOULD NOT be less than 
30 minutes and the new text about not 
accepting small session-timer values have on
session-expires immediate discussed in above
text?  Is this an exception to the small
Session-Expires rule?

Since the 488 with Session-Expires only works
in one direction, what does the UAC do besides 
send re-INVITE or eventually BYE based upon 
receiving a Require timer with small 
Session-Expires value in a 200 response?

Please note that this draft reflects the merger of draft-ietf-sip-isup-00
with draft-jfp-sip-isup-header-00. Also note that the elements of
draft-ietf-sip-isup-00 dealing with overlap dialing and signaling have been
removed from the new draft; a separate draft which will appear shortly
focuses solely on overlap procedures.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group
of the IETF.

	Title		: ISUP to SIP Mapping
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Roach et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt
	Pages		: 52
	Date		: 14-May-01
	
This document describes a way to perform the mapping between two
signaling protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
ISDN User Part (ISUP) of SS7.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Jonathan, you mentioned that this was not standards track. Why must we 
describe backwards compatibility with any old 
draft-yournamehere-sip-xxx.txt document? I hope that was not the intention 
of the Allison since that could kill some efforts. We should only be 
concerned about backwards compatibility with real standards track RFC's. If 
people choose to implement independent drafts, they do so knowing that it 
isn't standard. The rest of the community shouldn't have to suffer 
compliance with that random draft. If the SIP WG didn't do a good job of 
communicating the IETF process to implementors, future work shouldn't have 
to suffer.

Why is such a document needed? This is not something that needs 
standardization, especially at this stage. Anyone can build an IWF that 
speaks MGCP out one interface and SIP out another. How they choose to make 
sense of each message is up to them. Let's not try to reproduce Q.699.

That sounds fine.

Also, like you mentioned, we should explain in the draft the
disadvantages of using a low value, and why it is recommended not to use
a value less than 30 minutes. Otherwise we will soon have the same kind
of discussion on the list again.

thanks for the insight, and the counter-questions have made me think as to why we might need such a document.

yes, it is a gateway in question. firstly, i am little more than uninitiated about H323, and only a little more welloff about SIP, so while going thru the SIP-H323 i/w draft, i came up with this idea of SIP-MGCP draft. i know, there could be similar situation in case of SIP-ISUP and SIP-Q931 i/w, but obviously they are very simple looking, but it gets a little more involved when you have to map "Information Elements"... obviously, not all IE's would make sense one a call-signal enters from ISUP/ISDN to SIP... so which to drop, which to keep or re-map. easy answer i believe is -- keep the mandatory (as they are mandatory) and think about optionals... is that how people are implementing ? is it totally on a case-by-case basis, and is this where people/vendors are trying to be competetive -- by differntiating they way they i/w (and to what extent they i/w ??)

thanks for any further insight... still my basic question is, why do we need SIP-H323 i/w draft, and not SIP-MGCP i/w draft. one reason i can think of right away is that SIP and MGCP are not mutually-exclusive, rather perform complementary functions, which SIP/H323 are alternatives (to a great extent) of each other ? am i right or wrong ?

thanks,
iv.

do you think the DSS1/ISUP I/W document was unnecessary or not upto it's mark ? why i am asking this is because, i need to ascertain and justify to me and my peers that the task that's assigned to me, is really not worth "standardization effort". any arguments would help.

thanks,

Hi Jonathan,

Thank you for your responses.  I appreciate discussion on the Diversion I-D.
Comments are in-line.

I think you've just made the case for the Diversion header.  ;^)

A small nit, both proxies and user agent servers end up inserting the Diversion
header.  Smart user agent servers are able to implement call forward services
locally (without any assistance from a proxy).  There are examples of both
(proxy and UAS) diversion scenarios in Section 7 of the Diversion I-D.

I agree that Proxy-Require headers are an evil source of protocol
incompatability.  However, in the instance of the Diversion header, no
Proxy-Require header is needed.  The Diversion header is supplemental
information.  If a SIP proxy involved in a PSTN call doesn't add it, the worst
that will happen is that the customer expected behavior may not occur and
customers may complain until such time that the expected behavior is achieved.

Again, this is a strawman argument.  Although I agree that Proxy-Require
headers cause compatability problems, Diversion does not require use of a
Proxy-Require header.

So, the backward compatibilty issue is that this supplemental information was
not provided in the past.  Thus, services relying on this supplemental
information didn't work in the past.

<snip>

To summarize, there appear to be two models.  In the first model, (voicemail)
service policy is controlled at the user-agent server (Diversion I-D).  In the
second model, (voicemail) service policy is controlled at intermediate SIP
proxies or gateways (RFC3087).  In SIP-only networks or small networks, where
the SIP/PSTN gateway, SIP proxy, and SIP voicemail server are all owned and
administrated by the same domain, either model can work.

However, as networks scale up, ownership and connectivity of the devices
spreads out.  Here's an example that causes problems for RFC3087, but is simply
solved by supporting Diversion:

=====================
Scenario 1: Off-net diversion
=====================

In the following ladder diagram, a call is placed from the PSTN to 5551234
which hangs off of the 555xxxx PBX.  The Call Forward No Answer (CFNA) timer
expires in the PBX, and the PBX diverts the call to the user's admin/secretary
at 5551001.  The secretary's phone is busy, so the PBX diverts the call through
the local PSTN/SIP gateway and SIP proxy to the voicemail service with which
the enterprise has contracted, in this case a SIP voicemail service.  The SIP
proxy performs an (ENUM) lookup of 9231000 which resolves to 3.3.3.3.

When the call reaches the voicemail server, the message may be deposited into a
voice mailbox for 5551234, 5551000, or both depending on the configured policy.

In addition, in practice one would normally encounter scenarios where the SIP
proxy is owned by a carrier and the voicemail server by a third party.  In this
example, usage of the Diversion header allows voicemail service policy to be
changed (by the voicemail provider) without requiring changes in the carrier's
equipment.

RFC3087 approach:

In this approach, every carrier's PSTN/SIP GW would need to be configured with
voicemail vendor X's service policy.  For N voicemail service vendors, there
would need to be (at least) N policy rules in each PSTN/SIP GW.  Assuming
voicemail service policy which is configurable per-user, there would be the sum
(from 1 to NumVoicemailVendors) of the number of users of each voicemail
vendor:

NumVoicemailVendors
--
\      NumUsers(i)
/
--
i=1

As the number of (voicemail) service vendors increases, the complexity of this
policy configuration at _every_ PSTN/SIP GW increases.

With this approach, no policy configuration in the SIP GW or SIP proxy is
needed.  Each voicemail service vendor locally configures the desired policy.

====================================
Scenario 2: Diversion to Off-net voicemail server
====================================

In the following ladder diagram, a call is placed from a SIP user agent (UA1)
to 5551111.  The SIP proxy resolves this to another SIP user agent (UA2).  The
Call Forward No Answer (CFNA) timer expires in the SIP proxy, and the SIP proxy
diverts the call to the user's admin/secretary at 5551112.  The secretary's
phone is busy, so the SIP proxy diverts the call through the local SIP/PSTN
gateway to a PSTN voicemail service.

When the call reaches the voicemail server, the message may be deposited into a
voice mailbox for 5551234, 5551000, or both depending on the configured policy.

In addition, in practice one would normally encounter scenarios where the SIP
proxy and SIP GW is owned by a carrier and the voicemail server by a third
party.  In this example, usage of the Diversion header allows voicemail service
policy to be changed (by the voicemail provider) without requiring changes in
the carrier's equipment.

In this approach, the voicemail server must own a block of E.164 numbers (one
per subscriber).  For N voicemail service subscribers, the voicemail server
would need to own N E.164 numbers.  As the numbers of subscribers increases,
this may become a significant cost-issue for the voicemail service vendor.

Also notice that, in this approach, voicemail service policy is configured in
the carrier's SIP proxy.

With this approach, the voicemail vendor only needs one E.164 number and no
policy configuration in the carrier's SIP GW or SIP proxy is needed.  Each
voicemail service vendor locally configures the desired policy.



* I would really appreciate voicemail vendors (and voicemail equipment
manufacturers) speaking up on this issue.  Are you actually willing to depend
on your carrier to configure your service policy (per RFC3087)?  Are you
willing to wait for your carrier to deploy equipment that can configure the
service policy?  When your carrier misconfigures your service policy, who will
your customers blame?  What incentive will the carrier have to fix the problem
in a timely fashion?  Wouldn't you rather be in control of your own policy
(using a mechanism such as the Diversion I-D)?

* I would also appreciate feedback from carriers (and carrier equipment
manufacturers).  Per RFC3087, do you really want to have to change the policy
in all of your domain's border (GW and proxy) nodes everytime a third-party
(voicemail) service customer wants to change a service policy for one of their
customers?  What incentive do you have to update this policy in a timely
manner?  What incentive do you have to deploy equipment to support third-party
policy configuration?  Wouldn't you rather the (voicemail) service vendors
just  manage their own policy (using a mechanism such as the Diversion I-D)?

If PSTN calls use SIP only for backbone signalling, the SIP-T encapsulation
approach is fine.  However, when terminating SIP calls on PSTN networks, or
PSTN calls on SIP networks, a translative approach is needed to achieve the
expected behavior.

Although I'm not advocating replicating every ISUP header in SIP, I don't see
anything wrong with using equivalent (or a superset) of functionality of useful
ISUP headers.  A case-by-case approach seems appropriate to me.  Regardless,
this draft's sole focus is Diversion information.

One suggestion is to apply the same algorithm that we use for spiral loop
detection.  If the user portion of the (sip:user@host) URL does not change,
then consider it a simple routing decision (that does not require a Diversion
header).  If the user portion of the (sip:user@host) URL does change, then add
a Diversion header.

As I've described above, this argument does not apply.  If the user portion of
the URL changes, add a Diversion header.  If the user portion of the URL
doesn't change, don't add a Diversion header.

If several features such as CFB, CFNA, CFTOD are defined in one CPL script,
then the script would be capable of marking any one of 3 reasons (cfb, cfna,
cftod) depending on which scenario was encountered.  If the script truly has a
new reason, then define a new reason code.  This argument is akin to asking how
many response codes should be defined in SIP.  The answer is to define the ones
that you need, and don't define any more than you need.

Hi Jonathan,
<p>Thank you for your responses.&nbsp; I appreciate discussion on the Diversion
I-D.&nbsp; Comments are in-line.
<p>Jonathan Rosenberg wrote:

I think you've just made the case for the Diversion header.&nbsp; ;^)
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;Since proxies are
<br>the ones that insert Diversion, this means that Diversion would require
a
<br>Proxy-Require header to function.</blockquote>
A small nit, both proxies and user agent servers end up inserting the Diversion
header.&nbsp; Smart user agent servers are able to implement call forward
services locally (without any assistance from a proxy).&nbsp; There are
examples of both (proxy and UAS) diversion scenarios in Section 7 of the
Diversion I-D.
<p>I agree that Proxy-Require headers are an evil source of protocol incompatability.&nbsp;
However, in the instance of the Diversion header, no Proxy-Require header
is needed.&nbsp; The Diversion header is supplemental information.&nbsp;
If a SIP proxy involved in a PSTN call doesn't add it, the worst that will
happen is that the customer expected behavior may not occur and customers
may complain until such time that the expected behavior is achieved.
<p>&lt;snip>
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>Extensions that need Proxy-Require to function are
effectively non-backwards

very
<br>bad. May as well call them another protocol, since they are not compatible
<br>with baseline SIP.</blockquote>
Again, this is a strawman argument.&nbsp; Although I agree that Proxy-Require
headers cause compatability problems, Diversion does not require use of
a Proxy-Require header.
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>Now, this problem is fixable. As Allison has mentioned
during IETF 50, all
<br>extensions henceforth MUST describe how backwards compatibility operates.
<br>Therefore, the draft MUST describe how gateways, voicemail servers,
and
<br>anything else that looks at Diversion, would work in its absence.</blockquote>
So, the backward compatibilty issue is that this supplemental information
was not provided in the past.&nbsp; Thus, services relying on this supplemental
information didn't work in the past.
<p>&lt;snip>
<p>To summarize, there appear to be two models.&nbsp; In the first model,
(voicemail) service policy is controlled at the user-agent server (Diversion
I-D).&nbsp; In the second model, (voicemail) service policy is controlled
at intermediate SIP proxies or gateways (RFC3087).&nbsp; In SIP-only networks
or small networks, where the SIP/PSTN gateway, SIP proxy, and SIP voicemail
server are all owned and administrated by the same domain, either model
can work.
<p>However, as networks scale up, ownership and connectivity of the devices
spreads out.&nbsp; Here's an example that causes problems for RFC3087,
but is simply solved by supporting Diversion:
<p>=====================
<br>Scenario 1: Off-net diversion
<br>=====================
<p>In the following ladder diagram, a call is placed from the PSTN to 5551234
which hangs off of the 555xxxx PBX.&nbsp; The Call Forward No Answer (CFNA)
timer expires in the PBX, and the PBX diverts the call to the user's admin/secretary
at 5551001.&nbsp; The secretary's phone is busy, so the PBX diverts the
call through the local PSTN/SIP gateway and SIP proxy to the voicemail
service with which the enterprise has contracted, in this case a SIP voicemail
service.&nbsp; The SIP proxy performs an (ENUM) lookup of 9231000 which
resolves to 3.3.3.3.
<p>When the call reaches the voicemail server, the message may be deposited
into a voice mailbox for 5551234, 5551000, or both depending on the configured
policy.
<p>In addition, in practice one would normally encounter scenarios where
the SIP proxy is owned by a carrier and the voicemail server by a third
party.&nbsp; In this example, usage of the Diversion header allows voicemail
service policy to be changed (by the voicemail provider) without requiring
changes in the carrier's equipment.

<p>In this approach, every carrier's PSTN/SIP GW would need to be configured
with voicemail vendor X's service policy.&nbsp; For N voicemail service
vendors, there would need to be (at least) N policy rules in each PSTN/SIP
GW.&nbsp; Assuming voicemail service policy which is configurable per-user,
there would be the sum (from 1 to NumVoicemailVendors) of the number of
users of each voicemail vendor:
<p>NumVoicemailVendors
<br>--
<br>\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NumUsers(i)
<br>/
<br>--
<br>i=1
<p>As the number of (voicemail) service vendors increases, the complexity
of this policy configuration at _every_ PSTN/SIP GW increases.

<p>With this approach, no policy configuration in the SIP GW or SIP proxy
is needed.&nbsp; Each voicemail service vendor locally configures the desired
policy.
<p>====================================
<br>Scenario 2: Diversion to Off-net voicemail server
<br>====================================
<p>In the following ladder diagram, a call is placed from a SIP user agent
(UA1) to 5551111.&nbsp; The SIP proxy resolves this to another SIP user
agent (UA2).&nbsp; The Call Forward No Answer (CFNA) timer expires in the
SIP proxy, and the SIP proxy diverts the call to the user's admin/secretary
at 5551112.&nbsp; The secretary's phone is busy, so the SIP proxy diverts
the call through the local SIP/PSTN gateway to a PSTN voicemail service.
<p>When the call reaches the voicemail server, the message may be deposited
into a voice mailbox for 5551234, 5551000, or both depending on the configured
policy.
<p>In addition, in practice one would normally encounter scenarios where
the SIP proxy and SIP GW is owned by a carrier and the voicemail server
by a third party.&nbsp; In this example, usage of the Diversion header
allows voicemail service policy to be changed (by the voicemail provider)
without requiring changes in the carrier's equipment.

server would need to own N E.164 numbers.&nbsp; As the numbers of subscribers
increases, this may become a significant cost-issue for the voicemail service
vendor.

<p>With this approach, the voicemail vendor only needs one E.164 number
and no policy configuration in the carrier's SIP GW or SIP proxy is needed.&nbsp;
Each voicemail service vendor locally configures the desired policy.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>* I would really appreciate voicemail vendors (and voicemail equipment
manufacturers) speaking up on this issue.&nbsp; Are you actually willing
to depend on your carrier to configure your service policy (per RFC3087)?&nbsp;
Are you willing to wait for your carrier to deploy equipment that can configure
the service policy?&nbsp; When your carrier misconfigures your service
policy, who will your customers blame?&nbsp; What incentive will the carrier
have to fix the problem in a timely fashion?&nbsp; Wouldn't you rather
be in control of your own policy (using a mechanism such as the Diversion
I-D)?
<p>* I would also appreciate feedback from carriers (and carrier equipment
manufacturers).&nbsp; Per RFC3087, do you really want to have to change
the policy in all of your domain's border (GW and proxy) nodes everytime
a third-party (voicemail) service customer wants to change a service policy
for one of their customers?&nbsp; What incentive do you have to update
this policy in a timely manner?&nbsp; What incentive do you have to deploy
equipment to support third-party policy configuration?&nbsp; Wouldn't you
rather the (voicemail) service vendors just&nbsp; manage their own policy
(using a mechanism such as the Diversion I-D)?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>Onto the next issue.
<p>I believe the point was made that Diversion simplifies PSTN
<br>interoperability. If a request has been diverted in the PSTN, we can
carry
<br>the PSTN diversion information in SIP in the Diversion headers. This
way, we
<br>can design SIP enabled systems that provide servers to PSTN endpoints,
<br>without loss of information. However, we've talked about this issue
for a
<br>long time. The SIP group has already decided that instead of defining
each
<br>ISUP/ISDN header as a SIP header, we will encapsulate these PSTN messages
as
<br>bodies, and use SIP-T. That means we can still build SIP enabled systems
<br>that provide services to PSTN users, without loss of information, yet
we can
<br>avoid replicating each ISUP header into SIP.</blockquote>
If PSTN calls use SIP only for backbone signalling, the SIP-T encapsulation
approach is fine.&nbsp; However, when terminating SIP calls on PSTN networks,
or PSTN calls on SIP networks, a translative approach is needed to achieve
the expected behavior.
<p>Although I'm not advocating replicating every ISUP header in SIP, I
don't see anything wrong with using equivalent (or a superset) of functionality
of useful ISUP headers.&nbsp; A case-by-case approach seems appropriate
to me.&nbsp; Regardless, this draft's sole focus is Diversion information.
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>OK, now to some nitty gritty issues I have with Diversion.
It says that the
<br>proxies only insert the Diversion header when the call is diverted,
which is
<br>defined as:
<p>diversion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A change to the ultimate destination
endpoint
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of a request.&nbsp; A change in the Request-URI of a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
request that was not caused by a routing decision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is also sometimes called a deflection or
<br>redirection.
<br>A diversion can occur when the "user" portion of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Request-URI is changed for a reason other than
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
expansion or translation.
<p>Now, I would be really impressed if someone can tell me how to program
a
<br>proxy to know the difference between a routing decision that changes
the
<br>ultimate destination, and one that does not. In SIP, we make no distinction
<br>between the two.</blockquote>
One suggestion is to apply the same algorithm that we use for spiral loop
detection.&nbsp; If the user portion of the (sip:user@host) URL does not
change, then consider it a simple routing decision (that does not require
a Diversion header).&nbsp; If the user portion of the (sip:user@host) URL
does change, then add a Diversion header.
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>So, effectively, every single proxy or redirect operation
<br>will require the insertion of this Diversion header. This means another
set
<br>of stacked headers, of exactly the same length as the Via headers.
That
<br>significant overhead, and its additional processing. Furthermore, every
<br>proxy would need to do it for each and every call, since they don't
know
<br>whether the ultimate recipient will need to make use of Diversion to
provide
<br>some services.</blockquote>
As I've described above, this argument does not apply.&nbsp; If the user
portion of the URL changes, add a Diversion header.&nbsp; If the user portion
of the URL doesn't change, don't add a Diversion header.
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>The final concern I have is a "slippery slope" argument.

If several features such as CFB, CFNA, CFTOD are defined in one CPL script,
then the script would be capable of marking any one of 3 reasons (cfb,
cfna, cftod) depending on which scenario was encountered.&nbsp; If the
script truly has a new reason, then define a new reason code.&nbsp; This
argument is akin to asking how many response codes should be defined in
SIP.&nbsp; The answer is to define the ones that you need, and don't define
any more than you need.

thank you very much for your comments. i am posting this message with an obvious extra caution. i respect the "forum" and it's policies, but i can't help but try to take this discussion just 1 step further.

have the implementors/sip developers/contributors and WG looked at the proposals of MSF (www.msforum.org). they do believe in such a decomposition of UA under certain circumstances. i believe the motivation to keep this question of to decompose or not to, is left to implementor s.t. the applicability of SIP in general, remains more generic, than the "centralized" approach of traditional-telephony. also, another good place to look for very good (common-sensicle) ideas is TINA-C (www.tinac.com). i agree (and see your point) that SIP and MGCP are orthogonal, but like the SIP Hosts/Proxyserver's requirements (which tends to take a shape similar to the RFC defining requirements of internet routers/hosts), shouldn't it have some provision for this decomposed architecture too. is the WG sure that there is never going to be a SIP/MGCP document? not interworking, but use of MGCP in a decomposed SIP UA, type of document ?

anyway, this is my last post on this group regarding this topic.

thanks,
iv.

Whether the SIP proxy, GW (using RFC3087), or user-agent server (using
Diversion I-D) is making the policy decision, the same incoming information
is being used to apply the policy, namely the request-URI (and diversion
reason) at the time the call was diverted.

RFC3087 and the Diversion I-D both agree that the To: header cannot always
be used.

Here's an excerpt from RFC3087 on this matter, Section 3.1.2.1, paragraph
2:
An application designer may be tempted to attempt to match the To:
   and From: headers on a call to infer information.  However, this
   approach could cause complications when multiple proxy forwards occur
   in a call.  For example, A calls B, who has all calls forwarded to C.
   C forwards the call to her voice mail service.  If the voice mail
   service matches the To: header to determine the message store, it
   will get the information for B instead of C.  But there is no reason
   to assume that C's voice mail service has any knowledge of B.

Here's an excerpt from draft-levy-sip-diversion-02.txt, Section 9.3:
    Question 1:
        Why do we need the Diversion header when we can see the To: header?

    Answer:
        a) The To: header is not guaranteed to have significance
           to the called party.

           For example, the To: header may contain a locally significant
           URL (to the caller) such as a private numbering plan,
           speed dial digits, telephony escape digits, or
           telephony prefix digits.

           Without a Diversion header, enumerating all possible locally
           significant To: headers that anyone might use to contact
           Bob@uas1.isp.com becomes a configuration problem at
           Voicemail@isp.com and is prone to namespace collision.

           Support for Diversion headers enables Bob to contract
           a third-party service (Voicemail@isp.com) with a single
           globally significant URL for his voice mailbox
           (Bob@uas1.isp.com).

Even if the To: header contained the relevant information 98% of the time;
customers would certainly complain about the 2% of the time that a To:
header dependent implementation failed to provide the expected behavior.

Q.699 is a fine document, but it serves as a standard for traditional ISDN 
switches in a fixed, regulated environment. We are creating IWF's that go 
in devices such as Softswitches that are not at all fixed, and must worked 
in both regulated and non-regulated situations. We want the flexibility to 
evolve SIP and MGCP (same goes for SIP and H.323) interactions. This is 
very important as the utilization for SIP progresses to newer applications.

The point is that Diversion is neither useful nor required for this
service. Indeed, it only encourages the old-style implict service model.
If it's not useful, it doesn't need to be standardized.

The whole point is that B should remain in control of the call, since it
is the designated location. The Diversion header does not help at all in
clarifying intent by any of the parties involved.

This is appears to be an underlying assumption at which we're diverging.  When
control of the call is diverted (to a new user), we're assuming that control of
the called leg is transferred to that new user.  I believe that you're assuming
that control of the call remains with the original user.

Without an agreement on this assumption, I believe that we'll have to agree to
disagree.

I've pointed out several scenarios where the Diversion header is useful and
preferable for (voicemail) service vendors.  Please refer to the responses to
Jonathan's note.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: ISUP to SIP Mapping
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Roach et al.
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt
	Pages		: 52
	Date		: 14-May-01
	
This document describes a way to perform the mapping between two
signaling protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
ISDN User Part (ISUP) of SS7.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

An informational document that simply describes one vendors approach does
not need to worry about compliance with anything, since its just
informational.

However, this draft is aimed at becoming a standards track extension, and
thus needs to worry about backwards compatibility.

There is no Proxy-Authentication-Info defined in rfc2617; if we want such a
thing we will need to define it. Its not clear that we want this.

Hi,

OK. But how does nextnonce require any more state in the server than does a
simple 401 conveyed nonce? Even with Authentication-Info, the server only
needs to cache the nonces it has sent, right? Again, Authentication-Info
would only be sent by a server terminating the request, e.g. a registrar.
After a registrar has sent the new nonce and cached it, it can forget about
it. Doesn't matter whether the nonce left in a 401/WWW-Authenticate, or a
200/Authentication-Info.

As far as the mutual authentication part is concerned, sending
server-credentials in Authentication-Info should be as stateless by nature
as sending client-credentials in Authorization. In my opinion, neither case
introduces a need for state in the server.

It's a different case for Proxy-Authentication-Info, in which the server has
to maintain state in order to be able to insert the header into a returning
2xx response. But this shouldn't be a problem if we just add a disclaimer
saying that if Proxy-Authentication-Info is used, the server must be
stateful.

Then it has to be made a lot clearer. At least the bis-02 says in chapter
13.3:
"
	5.   The Authentication-Info and Proxy-Authentication-Info
           fields are not used in SIP.
"
And since the BNFs of Authorization, Proxy-Authorization, and
WWW-Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate are spelled out in the SIP bis
draft, I think it would be nice to have them for the Info headers as well.

BTW, Proxy-Authentication-Info is defined in rfc2617. Its semantics are
equal to those of  Authentication-Info. The only difference is that
Proxy-Authentication-Info is used with Proxy-Authenticate and
Proxy-Authorization headers with 407s, whereas Authentication-Info is used
with WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers with 401s. 

BR,
Aki

Hi,

I have a comment about the ISUP-SIP draft, related to SIP-T.

When PRACK is used, the UAS MUST include a Contact header and a To tag
in the 18x provisional responses. 

I think it should also be a MUST for an UAS supporting SIP-T, since the
UAC may send an INFO before it has received a final response for the
INVITE. This would ensure that the INFO reaches the same node from where
the 18x provisional response came, if the INVITE was forked.

Comments?

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Hi again,

I forgot a few lines from the previous mail :)

In the call flows in the ISUP-SIP draft, PRACK is used, which means the
Contact header MUST be in the provisional response. So, to ensure that
the Contact header and To tag are in the provisional response there are
two options:

1. To add the MUST, which I wrote in the first mail.

2. To add a MUST (I looked in the draft, but couldn't find it) for the
use of PRACK in SIP-T. 

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

In section 13.3 of bis-02, item 5 on page 116 says that Authentication-Info
and
Proxy-Authentication-Info are not used by SIP. Is there any reason why?

This would need to be removed and the headers would need to be added to the
grammar in Table 3 if we want to include them in SIP.

<snip>

I can sympathize will "both sides" in this discussion.  IMHO, one
approach places service control in the network whereas the other
supports service control in the endpoints.  I myself prefer control in
the endpoint, I don't want to rely on any more functionality outside of
my box than I have to.  And like other feature support defined for SIP,
there are multiple approaches.

I do believe for the proxy approach that feature provisioning will be made
available to the end user via the web (most likely) at some point,
minimizing a user's reliance on their service provider to make changes.

I also feel that useful/desirable end-user experiences can occur without
specific support for Diversion within proxies.  Endpoints that insert and
use Diversion only need proxies to pass along the header.

I believe Diversion has multiple applications but are they enough to
warrant standardization by an IETF WG.  I myself can't answer that
question.  It seems to me a more appropriate WG might be SIPPING.

Best Regards,
Bert

draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-10.txt passed the IESG.

That's right, yet another well-wrought SIP document has cleared the IESG and
is on its way to the RFC editor for final publication.

Thanks, all!

In reality, the service control features will reside in both places:
Endpoints and Network. It will be a mixture of both situations.

Assuming this is the practical situation, let us develop the protocol that
does not exclude anyone of those situations.

In this context, let us have a second look for the "Diversion" service
capabilities.

I can sympathize will "both sides" in this discussion.  IMHO, one
approach places service control in the network whereas the other
supports service control in the endpoints.  I myself prefer control in
the endpoint, I don't want to rely on any more functionality outside of
my box than I have to.  And like other feature support defined for SIP,
there are multiple approaches.

I do believe for the proxy approach that feature provisioning will be made
available to the end user via the web (most likely) at some point,
minimizing a user's reliance on their service provider to make changes.

I also feel that useful/desirable end-user experiences can occur without
specific support for Diversion within proxies.  Endpoints that insert and
use Diversion only need proxies to pass along the header.

I believe Diversion has multiple applications but are they enough to
warrant standardization by an IETF WG.  I myself can't answer that
question.  It seems to me a more appropriate WG might be SIPPING.

Best Regards,
Bert

No it doesn't.  The server can encode all the state it needs into the nonce.
2617 mentions the possibility of making your nonce values
    time-stamp H(time-stamp ":" ETag ":" private-key)
where H is a one-way-hash function and ETag is a unique value for the
requested entity.

The server just has to re-compute the hash after getting the request to make
sure it hasn't been forged, and then decide if it thinks the timestamp is
recent enough.

It's not formally defined with a grammar and all, but section 3.6 of 2617
says
   On subsequent responses, the server sends Proxy-Authentication-Info
   with directives the same as those for the Authentication-Info header
   field.
so I'd say it's technically there.

ACK for 200 OK is treated no different from a re-INVITE or BYE as far as
Route processing goes. So, if the UA has no DNS and always sends all
requests to its local outbound proxy without even glancing at the route set,
it would send the entire route set in Route headers. If the UA uses the top
Route header, it would pop it into the R-URI and then send the rest in the
Route headers in the ACK.

If I'm using a local outbound proxy for an initial request, and I don't
strip the maddr which identifies that proxy.

Egads, no! We are not going to define special case processing for how a
proxy gets Route headers.

<snip>

Here's a voicemail vendor speaking up. Would I be willing to depend on a
carrier to configure my service policy? That depends entirely on my
relationship with the carrier. In many circumstances, our equipment will be
purchased by carriers who then resell the voicemail feature to their end
customers. In this model, service configuration is very much the carrier's
bailiwick. In another model, an independent secondary service provider will
sell services (voicemail) directly to end customers, and (as a possibility)
they will tell the customer to use the provider's provisioning website to
give them XYZ voicemail.

I also do not believe that we will ever get to the point, nor will we really
wish to, where the endpoint is aware of ALL of the services that it must
use, and explicitly specifies them.

A couple of thoughts about implicit versus explicit functionality also comes
to mind in response to Hennings argument about Diversion creating an
implicit service model: Explicit service models make sense when the commands
that operate the service can be made generic enough that differing vendors
of the service can utilize the same command protocol. I think we can come up
with a short list fitting that criteria. Voicemail MIGHT be one of them. But
an explicit service (such as "I want to leave a message for user X on
voicemail system J with parameters A,B,C") creates a tight binding between
the consumer, provider and protocol. Lest I state the obvious, the point I
am trying to make is that explicitly driven functionality will soon become
outmoded no matter how noble your intent, and applications will forever be
drilling into SIP packets to make all sorts of inferences. We must recognize
that both implicit and explicit functions will happen in the network, and
that neither is evil.

Does this mean that if the local outbound proxy did a record-route
on the INVITE, the topmost Route header in the route list would
actually belong to the local outbound proxy and it will have to pop
it and actually use the second route entry for forwarding the ACK
further ??

Are you saying that a client in domain "xyz.com", when calling
sip:abc@abc.com, can do either of the following :

INVITE sip:abc@abc.com SIP/2.0

or

INVITE sip:abc@abc.com;maddr=proxy.xyz.com SIP/2.0

Thanks,
Shail

The point is that we cannot know which individual draft will become 
standards track until it actually becomes standards track. The same goes 
for official draft-ietf-sip documents. There is a long history in the IETF 
of documents that are aimed at becoming standards track only to be rejected 
or significantly changed before they make standards track or even become an 
official WG document. Again, if someone chooses to  implement an individual 
draft, you cannot expect everyone else to have backwards compatibility with 
it, no matter what the intention is.

Also there seems to be a fair bit of controversy about this draft so I'm 
not sure you can even make a special exemption in this case. But my concern 
is more general. Dealing with the progress of the bis draft is hard enough. 
Let's not burden SIP implementations with "legacy" items that weren't 
really standards track at the time.

I'll give it a try.

Any internet-draft must address backwards compatibility with
*published*, *standards track* *RFCs* before it is passed to the
IESG for publication.

That's it. No one needs to worry about backwards compatibility
towards drafts of any kind. Technically, that means that, yes, we
could attempt to publish draft as an RFC now which doesn't address
any issues arising from backwards compatibility with the rfc2543-bis
draft. It would be stupid for us to do so (and we'd never be able
to fit it in on the calandar), but there are no procedural issues
with our doing so.

So, addressing the specific situation under discussion: no one ever
needs to address backwards compatibility issues with the diversion
draft unless (and even then, until) it is published as a standards
track RFC.

Thanks for pointing out Proxy-Authentication-Info 
and Authentication-Info.  They do appear to be 
better for next nonce than WWW-Authenticate in 
2xx responses.

Usage of these headers would help improve call 
setup time and system/network capacity by 
reducing 401/407 responses from registrars,
outbound-proxies, etcetera.

Henning/Jonathan:
Since authentication and security in the bis 
is slated for rework anyway, can headers
Proxy-Authentication-Info and 
Authentication-Info be added?  If you think 
that there might not be enough interest, can we 
ask the list for comments about its need or 
usefulness?

Hello,

I believe that this behavior is vanilla SIP, isn't it?

We use the Contact/Route in provisional responses for an INVITE to send
requests (typically PRACK, COMET and/or INFO) until we get the 200 OK
for the INVITE with the definitive Route/Contact for the session. Why
would you think we should add this in the ISUP-SIP draft?

Regards,

Gonzalo

Hi

	I am new to this group and also to this domain. I have very few
basic queries regarding SIP and I would like you to help me out. Please do
reply as soon as possible

1) What role does User Agent plays ? Is it necessary that only through User
Agent we can contact the SIP Server ? if yes then how does the ordinary
Telephone, which everyone at their residences use can get connected ?

2) Can a ordinary Telephone, which everyone at their residences have can
contact SIP Server ? and from there interact with other SIP   USERS ?

3) When I transmit Voice over SIP which use TCP/IP, what role does SIP play
at that time ?

	I thank you in advance for your kind help and time. I would really
appreciate if you could reply back to me as soon as possible. 

Thanking you

Regards

Hi,

>I believe that this behavior is vanilla SIP, isn't it?

I don't think it is mandatory (I appologise if I'm wrong) to include a
Contact header in a 18x provisional responses, and to include a To-tag
in a 18x provisional response. From a basic SIP standard point of view
it's optional, but different extension functionalities (eg PRACK and
SIP-T) can then make it mandatory.

>We use the Contact/Route in provisional responses for an INVITE to send
>requests (typically PRACK, COMET and/or INFO) until we get the 200 OK

It is nowhere said that we use Contact/Route in provisional responses
for these kind of requests - no matter what request it is. Yes, the
100rel draft says it for PRACK, and the manyfolks draft may say it for
COMET, but I haven't seen it anywhere for INFO.

My point was that I wanted to make it a MUST, or at least a SHOULD, for
nodes supporting SIP-T, to make sure that any possible INFO sent by the
UAC before the 200 is received reaches the same UAS, and that is why I
wanted to add it to the ISUP-SIP draft.

...or, it should be added to the bis draft that this is a MUST always
when the UAC may send a new request (PRACK, COMET, INFO, whatever...)
before the final response is received.

Hi,

In rfc2543bis-02 Table 5 is stated that the Record-Route header is optional for _all_ methods. However, if the Record-Route header is used for ACK there might be a problem, since ACK has no response to carry the Record-Route header back. This might result in different routes for the different directions of the message flow of the same call-leg. I think that Record-Route header should be stated "Not applicable" for ACK.

We can't make rules for every weird situation that can happen. I think that
a server that Record-Routes the ACK without Record-Routing the INVITE is one
of those weird situations that shouldn't be dealt with because any sane
implementation would not do such a thing.

Hello All,

what is the recommended 'timeout value' for a sipstack to wait for a response.

In particular, what is the recommended time  the sipstack  would wait for an
ACK for a 200 OK.

Thanks

Hello,

As I said in my previous mail, this is a general SIP question. It has
nothing to do with the fact that you use SIP-T or that you are a
gateway.

The general question you are after is: "Where do I send requests if the
INVITE transaction is not complete yet?". 

I believe that bis should say that typically no requests are sent before
the INVITE terminates, but that there are a few exceptions, namely:
PRACK, COMET and INFO.

Then, it can be explained in bis or in the RFCs defining the extensions
where to send the requests (Route/Contact of provisional responses).

So, answering this question is up to bis and the drafts/RFCs defining
the extensions themself, but never up to the isup-sip mapping draft. We
do not explain how to locate a SIP server either, because bis deals with
it already. Let's not try to make the scope of the mapping draft wider.
Its scope is good as it is right now.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

Hi
     if u don't want the sip stack to timeout and want it to wait for
infinite time for the ACK then give the value -1. and 0 for
 asynchronous receive.

Subject: [SIP] timeout value for response


Hello All,

what is the recommended 'timeout value' for a sipstack to wait for a
response.

In particular, what is the recommended time  the sipstack  would wait for an
ACK for a 200 OK.

Thanks

Hi,

I agree with what you say. 

So, one could argue that it should be said in the INFO RFC instead of
the ISUP-SIP draft.

HOWEVER, the INFO RFC says (unfortunately, I think...) that INFO is used
for mid-session (ie AFTER the INVITE transaction is finished) only, so
one could say it is not an issue there. Then, since the ISUP-SIP draft
is the first (and currently only) SIP extension that may also use INFO
BEFORE the INVITE transaction is finished, one could argue that it
should be said there. The third option is, like you mentioned, to put it
as a general rule in the bis draft, for ANY request that may be sent
before the INVITE transaction is finished. 

My point is, that since it may cause problems for SIP-T, I want it
mentioned SOMEWHERE :)

Christer Holmberg

Ranjit,

I dont want our SIP Proxy to timeout neither.  But we
our using a dynamicsoft proxy.  Will setting the
timeout to -1 or 0 set the timout to infinity on the
dynaimcsoft SIP stack.  Thnx a lot.

I have at least 5 different email addresses that I use in various
contexts. None of them have the same user part. I don't think the
heuristic you're proposing is going to be very effective in eliminating
"routing decisions" changes to request URLs. Hence you end up with all
the problems listed by Jonathan.

Greetings

In preparation for the WG last call on the privacy draft, I have updated
it to address the comments I received at the last IETF as well as a
couple of off-line comments I got. The updates are:

- Additional security considerations including a more clear description
of the assumed architecture within which the privacy parts of the draft
can and can not be used.
- Interaction with vanilla SIP proxies that do not support the extension

- IANA considerations for registering extensions
- Added prefix naming convention for "other-rpi-token" to indicate
whether an "other-rpi-token" extension affects verification or not.
- Included a new "other-rpi-token" to identify Nature of Party.


You can retrieve the document at


http://members.bellatlantic.net/~fandreas/IETF/SIP/draft-ietf-sip-privacy-02.txt

until it appears in the archives.


Regards

        Flemming

Hello,

The purpose of INFO (before everybody began thinking that INFO can be
used for everything in the world) was to transport PSTN signalling.
However, since the INFO RFC was issued before we were ready with the
mapping draft, some minor changes will have to be added when INFO
advances to draft standard.

About a general comment in the bis draft (about where to send requests
before the 200 OK), as I said, I think it is necessary.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Yes it is possible to use the normal PSTN phone but you might have to
implement
some sort of proxy on your SIP GW which will do that for your phone.

SIP is essentially a control protocol. Voice is transmitted using RTP
protocol
via UDP.

Hi,

We read your SIP-ISUP draft with great interest, and had a question
concerning support of additional parameters outside the scope of
international ISUP. In particular, would you have plans to incorporate
support of the Diversion header (Redirecting number) into your draft? 
Although this topic is still controversial, standardized support of this
information would prove extremely valuable in applications such as voice
mail.

Thank you in advance for your response.

Hello,

It is mentioned in the draft that a REL that contains a new number where
the callee might be reached should generate a 3xx response. The new
number will go into the Contact header. I believe that there is no need
of extra support in order to provide this feature.

Besides, there are a lot of switches in the PSTN that do not support
this. Therefore, I am not sure how many gateways are going to implement
this feature.

Regards,

Gonzalo

Respected Sir

	I have a few very basic queries regarding the SIP protocol, like 

1) Who controls the voice when it is transmitted over the network.?

2) What is the main purpose of User Agent in SIP ?

3) Through SIP we can switch between various devices like PDA, Mobile, etc..
can we make a voice call to an ordinary PSTN phone ?
if yes how does the entire process work ?

4) What are the various voice channel in SIP?

5) Can we transmit data and voice at the same time ? (i.e.) I wish to
transmit the voice as well images to an mobile device which is 
connected to the SIP Server ?

6) Where should the SIP User Agent reside ?

7) Please explain in detail regarding USER AGENT.

8) How much does a SIP Server , User Agent and Proxy Server cost ?


	I would appreciate if you could send me any basic information
regarding SIP, I am sure by going through the above questions you would have
understood that I am trying to get hold of SIP core working. I have
downloaded SIP RFCs, and have gone through faq which is located at
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/faq/cache/1.html. 

	If there is any other URLs located on the web that you feel will
help me better understand the technical detail and the working of SIP then
please do let me know. I hope to hear from you soon. Please reply as soon as
possible. 

Thank you

Regards

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: RTCP attribute in SDP
	Author(s)	: C. Huitema
	Filename	: draft-huitema-sdp4nat-00.txt
	Pages		: 6
	Date		: 18-May-01
	
The session description protocol (SDP) is used to describe the 
parameters of media streams used in multimedia sessions. When a 
session requires multiple ports, SDP assumes that these port have 
consecutive numbers. However, when the session crosses a network 
address translation device that also uses port mapping, the ordering 
of ports can be destroyed by the translation. To handle this, we 
propose an extension attribute to SDP.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huitema-sdp4nat-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-huitema-sdp4nat-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-huitema-sdp4nat-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi
     I am not sure of the internal implementation of dynamicsoft SIP stack.
But ya setting timeout to -1 will make the proxy wait for infinite time.
u can also alternatively set the timeout to a specific value and wait for
that time  period.

Ranjit,

I dont want our SIP Proxy to timeout neither.  But we
our using a dynamicsoft proxy.  Will setting the
timeout to -1 or 0 set the timout to infinity on the
dynaimcsoft SIP stack.  Thnx a lot.

What fee?  What is being charged for?  If it is some sort of a per minute
charge for the SIP session, then this diagram is a perfect illustration of
why it is not a good idea to base billing on SIP messaging.

Respected Sir

I have a few very basic queries regarding the SIP protocol, like

1) Who controls the voice when it is transmitted over the network.?

like u transmit voice thru audio channel ...i.e basically thru real time
protocol (RTP).

2) What is the main purpose of User Agent in SIP ?

user agent is the client / server entity that transmit / receive audio /
video data.

3) Through SIP we can switch between various devices like PDA, Mobile, etc..
can we make a voice call to an ordinary PSTN phone ?
if yes how does the entire process work ?

yes you can make a voice call to a PSTN phone using SIP - PSTN gateway. to
switch between PDA, Mobile , first of all
u need have user agent softeware running in them.

4) What are the various voice channel in SIP?

there are no various vocie channel, but different codecs. like G.723, G.711,
etc.

5) Can we transmit data and voice at the same time ? (i.e.) I wish to
transmit the voice as well images to an mobile device which is
connected to the SIP Server ?

yes. u can. like u need to open different sessions for that. like for audio
we have session id 1, for video session id 2 and for data
session id 3.

6) Where should the SIP User Agent reside ?

in the device say a IP phone. or mobile  or PC to which a telephone is
connected.

7) Please explain in detail regarding USER AGENT.

may be u could go to sip rfc for this ( RFC 2543)

8) How much does a SIP Server , User Agent and Proxy Server cost ?

check with rescpective vendors

I would appreciate if you could send me any basic information
regarding SIP, I am sure by going through the above questions you would have
understood that I am trying to get hold of SIP core working. I have
downloaded SIP RFCs, and have gone through faq which is located at
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/faq/cache/1.html.

If there is any other URLs located on the web that you feel will
help me better understand the technical detail and the working of SIP then
please do let me know. I hope to hear from you soon. Please reply as soon as
possible.

go to http://www.sipcentre.com. or give a search in google.

Thank you

Regards

Date: Mon, 21 May 2001 14:29:18 -0400 (EDT)

I have completed a review of draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-04, and have
a few problems/issues that I'd like to raise with it.


1.  The Referred-By header defined in draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-04
looks like a subset of the Remote-Party-ID header defined in
draft-ietf-sip-privacy-02.  I see no reason why two separate
headers need to be defined for the same purpose; I recommend
cc-transfer utilize the Remote-Party-ID header instead of defining
its own.

2.  There are some substantial technical issues with section 4.5,
Unattended Transfer with Consultation Hold.

First, there needs to be normative behavior specified for a UAS that
receives a REFER-generated INVITE, so it doesn't respond with a
486-Busy if the intention was a consultation transfer
(assuming the transfer target is still off-hook from the consultation).

The UAS also needs to respond to all INVITEs other than the REFER-
generated INVITE with a 486-Busy until the REFER-generated INVITE arrives.
How does the transfer target know to do this?  Something in the BYE?
Is the length of the interval purely implementation-specific?  I think
the draft should give some normative behavior for the first, and guidance
for the proper interval.

As this involves non-2543 handling in the transfer-target, I believe
a Require: header is needed on the consultation call; this draft
should define the tag value.

3.  Section 4.5.3 mentions some of the complications with proxies and
consultation calls, but not all of them; I believe there are still 
open issues.

One basic assumption made in this situation is that the Contact
header value from the consultation call is usable by the Transferee
to reach the same endpoint.  Such a globally-reachable Contact
is not required anywhere else - it is only necessary that the Contact
value be understandable to the last proxy that inserted itself into
the Record-Route header.  

As a consequence, I believe the Refer-To header may need a Route
header attached to it for proper handling of the REFER-generated
INVITE.  However, the Route headers for the existing call legs
are only partially applicable to the new Transferee-initiated
session.  How should the Route header be calculated for a REFER?

There are certainly situations where the backup proposal, Accept-Contact,
will not reach the desired transfer-target, and a Route header is the
only workable solution.  One such case is time-of-day routing, where
the transfer-target is removed as a valid translation of the destination
between the time of the consultation and the time of the transfer.


Remainder are mainly editorial, and easily fixed.

4.  Section 4.5.3 makes reference to the Accept-Contact header,
which is (I believe) only defined in 2543bis-03.  Normative definition 
of this should appear in the cc-transfer draft, avoiding the dependency 
on 2543bis.

5.  There are a number of editorial nits that need to be fixed in
the draft before submission to IESG.  
  a. The reference to draft-ietf-sip-cc-01 should be removed, since 
	that draft is no longer available.  Since it is an informative 
	references, rather than a normative one, the relevant information 
	can be included in the main body of the draft without adding it 
	to the list of references.
  b. section 2 should be removed
  c. two paragraphs starting "Open Issue" should be deleted from 3.6.2.1
  d. section 5 issues have been resolved technically, so should be resolved 
	in the text and removed

Bill - Thanks for digging though this. I'm assuming (based on 
the last section of your feedback) that you did this as a nit-review
assignment?

I am in the midst of  splitting the draft, incorporating Replaces
and reworking the callerprefs usage in the application half of the 
split. I'll work through these comments while I'm in there.

Rakesh - Has anyone else been assigned to review this draft?
As I mentioned when Rohan completed the nits review - this
document is not ready for a last call nit pass - it is being
split into two documents, and each of those will need nit
pressure when they are done. This work will certainly benefit
from what Bill and Rohan have put into it, but if there is
something actually ready to go into last call, spend the
resources there.

Hello,

We have received several comments on the isup-sip mapping draft. I
believe that it is worthwhile mentioning one of them so that the WG can
think about it (it is a small issue, though).

Right now, signalling other than IAM, ACM, ANM, CON, REL... is
transferred between gateways using INFO. However, since INFO does not
ensure in order delivery, while the session is being established (before
the 200 OK for the INVITE), the draft recommends that 183s are used
instead of INFO.

Actually, the out of order delivery does not represent a problem in
99.9% of the cases. (I cannot think of a situation whn we will have a
problem because of this). Therefore, folks have suggested to recommend
that INFO is used regardless of the state of the establishment of the
call.

It has some advantages over 183:
1) It is a more coherent solution, since (for instance), the INR will be
sent always in an INFO, and not in a 183 or an INFO depending of the
situation. This can simplify implementations.

2) It makes a clar distintion between what is session progress (ACM,
CPGs) and what is a trasfer of PSTN signalling (INR...).

3) It saves one message (INFO-ACK vs. 183-PRACK-200 OK).

Therefore, I think that we should use INFO all the time. This can be
done by only changing one paragraph in the draft (section guidelines for
mapping other ISUP flavors).

If nobody thinks that this is a bad idea we will go ahead and change it.

Best regards,

Gonzalo

Actually, INFO is perfectly ordered once you take into consideration
the requirement that you can have at most one INFO outstanding
at a time. This is a no-brainer. Use INFO.

Hi,

I agree too. Use INFO.

A question, however: 

How will proxies handle INFOs that are sent, no matter the direction,
before the call is established? If there is a problem, should we define
a Proxy-Require tag ("sipt", or something) to make sure that all proxies
in the path will support this?

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Hello,

I want to know the detailed informations of 183 and INFO.

Could you tell me where I can find them?

Thank you in advance .

Any proxy, except horribly, HORRIBLY broken ones, will proxy on
unknown methods just fine. This isn't a problem.

This seems an excellent idea. One of the objects in the privacy draft was to
provide a generic capability for transport of identity information - now
that we have the capability, it makes sense to use it.

Actually, it was done based purely on the Last Call Calendar on the
SIP Supplemental Page (and my volunteering to be a reviewer by attending
the working sessions at last IETF meeting).  No formal assignment.

I've been a little puzzled by the dates on the calendar, though, and the 
lack of formal announcements on the mail list about last calls.  (e.g.,
is draft-ietf-sip-guidelines-02 in last call right now?  Does session-timer
go to IESG today?)

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: SCTP as a Transport for SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-sctp-01.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 21-May-01
	
This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream
Control Transmisson Protocol) as the transport between SIP entities.
SCTP is a new protocol which provides several features that may prove
beneficial for transport between SIP entities which exchange a large
amount of messages, including gateways and proxies. As SIP is
transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively
straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.

by different types of party information such as calling and called
party. For each type of party information, different types of
identity information, e.g. subscriber, or terminal, can be provided.

Adam,

Where is the "only one INFO outstanding" requirement 
mentioned?  I haven't noticed it in RFC 2976.  Or 
were you proposing that the isup-sip mapping draft
contain a statement requiring an INFO response before
sending the next INFO request.

Hi Brett,

This has nothing to do with the INFO method itself, or ISUP-SIP. It is
related to the issue of having overlapping transactions in SIP, no
matter the request method (INVITE is a special case, though).

This is a specialized restatment of the SIP WG decision that
(except for INVITE, which may be pending while other transactions
complete, and CANCEL, which may complete while other transactions
are pending), no two transactions in the same leg in the same
direction may overlap.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Mapping of ISUP Overlap Signalling to SIP
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, A. Roach, J. Peterson, L. Ong
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-overlap-00.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 22-May-01
	
This document describes a way to map ISUP overlap signalling to SIP.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-overlap-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-overlap-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-overlap-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

In looking at this draft and the SIP-T draft :

I think it would be good for the draft(s) to address procedures for the 
case when an IAM is received
at the ingress MGC with a COT on Previous circuit indication in the nature 
of call indicators.  If the
COT on previous indication is carried by the INVITE in the embedded ISUP to 
the egress MGC and
sent in a subsequent IAM,  either

	1.  a procedure should be defined for delivering the eventual COT message 
through the SIP
	network (INFO?)

or

	2.  the ingress MGC must break the COT on previous chain and not send an 
INVITE
	with the embedded IAM indicating COT on previous.  In this case, it the 
ingress
	MGC would have to hold up the INVITE until the COT message is received.

It would be the second choice: there's no point in checking
circuit continuity across an IP network. I think this is actually
discussed in the draft. Specifically, if my memory serves,
it is the example that we give for the class of problems that
we will not attempt to solve in this draft. ISUP administrative
procedures (such as circuit maintanance) are outlined in their
relevant specifcations, and don't need to be repeated in ours.

An additional factor is that the procedure you talk about
is ANSI specific. You need to keep in mind that each flavor of
ISUP has its own maintanance procedures; repeating all of these
procedures for all flavors and detailing exactly how they will
work for a SIP-ISUP gateway would take years, and result in a
several-thousand page document.

In this case (as with others), the correct answer is rather obvious:
it just takes a very brief rumination on the meaning of circuit
continutity testing and some common sense to figure out how to implement
this sort of function in the spirit of the ISUP specs.

Adam,

Thanks for your comments -

I was not implying that we would want to check continuity across the IP
network ... the reason for the COT on previous was to allow for a pipeline
of COT across a series of switches to reduce dial delay.  So I did not think
the answer was that straight forward.

This bit is found in Q.763 and I did not think it was limited to ANSI
only.

David

This sort of scenario is also addressed in the SIP-T Contexts and
Architectures draft:

http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vemuri-sip-t-context-02.txt

... in section 8 note number 4, so at the very least this is a known
problem. As Adam noted, this is only one of a whole class of such problems.
While your suggestions could potentially work, I think that in all instances
this is probably something that a terminating gateway should address by
ignoring certain aspects of the received encapsulated ISUP if they are
determined to be out of date or inappropriate. I don't think that sending
the COT or what have you is necessary - the terminating gateway has no use
for this information; bug I agree with you that the originating gateway
should withhold the INVITE in this case until it receives a COT - in fact,
this is specified explicitly in draft-ietf-sip-isup-01 section 10.3.

I envision that there will be a new SIP-T draft at some point that will
address several types of potential ISUP modification in greater detail,
including this sort of case.

In looking at this draft and the SIP-T draft :

I think it would be good for the draft(s) to address procedures for the 
case when an IAM is received
at the ingress MGC with a COT on Previous circuit indication in the nature 
of call indicators.  If the
COT on previous indication is carried by the INVITE in the embedded ISUP to 
the egress MGC and
sent in a subsequent IAM,  either

	1.  a procedure should be defined for delivering the eventual COT
message 
through the SIP
	network (INFO?)

or

	2.  the ingress MGC must break the COT on previous chain and not
send an 
INVITE
	with the embedded IAM indicating COT on previous.  In this case, it
the 
ingress
	MGC would have to hold up the INVITE until the COT message is
received.

Hi Uri,

         I have also come across this 'inconsistency' a few months
back. Then after I referred to RFC 2543, I came to the conclusion that it
is a typo mistake in that they have forgotten to change them from 
previous version in RFC 2543(ie. from 'csvax.cs.caltech.edu'  to
'sip.example.com'  and 'north.east.isi.edu' to 'mouse.wonderland.com' ,
etc.

HTH.

Cheers,
Victor

In thread 
http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2001q2/006996.html,
Adam and Christer mentioned that there is now 
a restriction that only 1 request can be 
outstanding in the same direction at the same 
time on a call-leg.  They mentioned that exceptions 
are made during an inviting/re-inviting situations, 
and exceptions are made for CANCEL.  I assume that 
the same exception would be made for a BYE.

What IETF/WG meeting minutes, email, or draft 
captures the restriction mentioned by Adam?
What were the reasons for the restriction?  
It seems like the need for such a message 
throttling requirement is context specific.

Thanks in advance for a response.

Jonathan, Henning

Two quick comments for the sake of next version of the bis:

1. 16.2 (Invitation to a multicast) - some mismatch with host names in the
Via headers.
2. 16.5 (forking proxy) looks like an ACK is missing for the 487 (or either
say it textually)

As you know, I support this change of using the INFO instead of 183,
specifically for the 2 reasons invoked above.

Hello,

After the split of draft-ietf-sip-isup-00.txt we have released two
drafts:

draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt covers all the mapping stuff excluding
overlap signalling.
draft-ietf-sip-overlap-00.txt covers overlap signalling.

Comments are welcome,

Best regards,

Gonzalo

	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with

Hello,

This draft takes into consideration the last discussions about
transporting SIP over SCTP. I hope this helps increase the number of
implementations that experiment with SCTP.

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-sctp-01.txt

The draft outlines the advantages that can derive from its use below
SIP.

Regards,

Gonzalo

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


	Title		: SCTP as a Transport for SIP
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne
	Filename	: draft-rosenberg-sip-sctp-01.txt
	Pages		: 8
	Date		: 21-May-01
	
This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream
Control Transmisson Protocol) as the transport between SIP entities.
SCTP is a new protocol which provides several features that may prove
beneficial for transport between SIP entities which exchange a large
amount of messages, including gateways and proxies. As SIP is
transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively
straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.

The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'MIME media types for ISUP and
QSIG Objects' <draft-ietf-sip-isup-mime-10.txt> as a Proposed
Standard.  This document is the product of the Session Initiation
Protocol Working Group.  The IESG contact persons are Allison Mankin
and Scott Bradner.


Technical Summary
 
   This draft defines MIME types for application/ISUP and
   application/QSIG objects for use in SIP applications, according to
   the rules defined in RFC 2048.  These types can be used to
   identify ISUP and QSIG objects within a SIP message such as INVITE or
   INFO, as might be implemented when using SIP in an environment where
   part of the call involves interworking to the PSTN.

   ISUP (ISDN User part) defined in the ITU-T recommendations Q.761-4 is
   a signaling protocol used between telephony switches.  There are
   configurations in which ISUP-encoded signaling information needs to
   be transported between SIP entities as part of the payload of SIP
   [RFC2543] messages, where those messages must also affect logic of
   intervening PSTN systems.

   QSIG is the analogous signaling protocol used between private branch
   exchanges to support calls within private telephony networks.  There
   is a similar need to transport QSIG-encoded signaling information
   between SIP entities in some environments.

   The draft is specific to this usage and would not
   apply to the transportation of ISUP or QSIG messages in other
   applications. These media types are intended for ISUP or QSIG
   application information that is used within the context of a SIP
   session, and not as general purpose transport of SCN signaling.

   The definition of media types for ISUP and QSIG application
   information does not address fully how the non-SIP and SIP entities
   exchanging messages determine or negotiate compatibility.  It is assumed
   that this is addressed by alternative means such as configuration of
   the interworking functions.  The specification primarily defines the
   and registers the mime media types.

   Information contained in ISUP and QSIG bodies may include sensitive
   customer information, potentially requiring use of encryption.
   Payload encryption mechanisms are provided in RFC 2543 and should be
   used as appropriate for both the SIP message and the encapsulated
   ISUP and QSIG body.


Working Group Summary

  The working group achieved consensus to advance the draft.

Protocol Quality

  The draft was reviewed for the IESG by Allison Mankin.

hi,
  i am new user to Sip,and i have implemented a parser for a Sip message and 
it parses the Sip Message Line by Line.i want to implement a Stateless 
Proxy,i would like to know What methods my Stateless Proxy Should understand 
and What Responses it should generate.i went to RFC-2543 but it never says 
anything about the methods a stateless proxy should understand,it talks only 
about the methods understood by a Proxy Server,does that mean the method 
should be understood by a Statelss Proxy and a Stateful Proxy?.actually i am 
developing a Interfaces that will be used to write a stateless proxy,in that 
i have decided to give a interface for changing the Request-URI as the 
RFC-2543 says that the Proxy SHOULD change the request-URI,i am unable to 
procced in implementing the interface as it needs to DNS SRV lookup,can 
anyone tell me how far this interface would be relavent for a Stateless 
Proxy?.When a Proxy Receives a Request,it checks the Top most Via to see of 
the Request-URI is correct as seen by the proxy,now here i would like to 
know whether the proxy needs to keep a list of all the users it 
knows?.kindly clear my doubts.if they have already been discussed,sorry i 
might have missed in the mailing lists.
            Thank u.

I am bringing a proposal from an off line discussion to the list, as it
proposes a change to the existing session timer specification.

No; MUST would be appropriate. However, I'm not sure this bit is needed. 

The reason has to do with a decision we made at IETF 49. That decision was
to say that if a mid-call request generates a 481, the UAC considers the
call terminated. In that case, if a UAS gets a session timer refresh with a
tag, and doesn't want to reconstitute the call, it can just generate a 481
and that terminates the call. The bit on using session timer is an alternate
way to do it. I don't like it as much since it requires the session timer
extension to provide a function which really belongs (and now is) in the
baseline spec).

So, perhaps we should remove that text altogether...

Section 1.35.1 Record-Route Operation says:
	The Record-Route header field contains a globally reachable SIP-URI that
identifies the proxy server,
	including an address parameter (maddr) that identifies its location. Each
such proxy server adds the
	Request-URI of the incoming request to the beginning of the list.

What if the Request-URI of the incoming request does not match a host on the
proxy server?

What should a proxy do if the R-URI that it receives is a Tel URL (which it
understands) but wants to add a Record-Route header? Should it convert it to
SIP-URI? and if so, what does it use as the host for this SIP-URI?

Hi Manish,

   The basic difference between stateless and stateful proxy is  stateless
proxy forgets about the SIP request once it has forwarded.
But stateful prxies remember the request so that they can associate the
request with the corresponding response and also take care
of any retransmissions if required. Also Stateful proxies maintain
transaction states i.e in which state a transaction is ....

like WaitingForFinalResponse  or WaitingForACK , etc.

But both types of proxies are logical. A physical proxy can act as both
stateful and stateless depending on the requirement.

HTH.

Hi
    One possibility could be through use of timers i.e you wait for some
event to take place within a certain time frame and if it
does not happen you abort the transaction and restart it .

or maintain a counter for maximum number of retransmissions and abort the
transaction after  you reached that limit.

Any comments?

oh; doest that mean that RFC2543bis doesn't specify the action to be taken
for a statful proxy?  This is left up to the implementor?  Seems like a BCP
might be in order... thanks. /m.

Hi Manish,

   The basic difference between stateless and stateful proxy is  stateless
proxy forgets about the SIP request once it has forwarded.
But stateful prxies remember the request so that they can associate the
request with the corresponding response and also take care
of any retransmissions if required. Also Stateful proxies maintain
transaction states i.e in which state a transaction is ....

like WaitingForFinalResponse  or WaitingForACK , etc.

But both types of proxies are logical. A physical proxy can act as both
stateful and stateless depending on the requirement.

HTH.

hi,
  i am new user to Sip,and i have implemented a parser for a Sip message and
it parses the Sip Message Line by Line.i want to implement a Stateless
Proxy,i would like to know What methods my Stateless Proxy Should understand
and What Responses it should generate.i went to RFC-2543 but it never says
anything about the methods a stateless proxy should understand,it talks only
about the methods understood by a Proxy Server,does that mean the method
should be understood by a Statelss Proxy and a Stateful Proxy?.actually i am
developing a Interfaces that will be used to write a stateless proxy,in that
i have decided to give a interface for changing the Request-URI as the
RFC-2543 says that the Proxy SHOULD change the request-URI,i am unable to
procced in implementing the interface as it needs to DNS SRV lookup,can
anyone tell me how far this interface would be relavent for a Stateless
Proxy?.When a Proxy Receives a Request,it checks the Top most Via to see of
the Request-URI is correct as seen by the proxy,now here i would like to
know whether the proxy needs to keep a list of all the users it
knows?.kindly clear my doubts.if they have already been discussed,sorry i
might have missed in the mailing lists.
            Thank u.

ya  RFC only specifies what a proxy should do, but does not differentiate
between stateful and stateless.

Hi
    One possibility could be through use of timers i.e you wait for some
event to take place within a certain time frame and if it
does not happen you abort the transaction and restart it .

or maintain a counter for maximum number of retransmissions and abort the
transaction after  you reached that limit.

Any comments?

My understanding is that the paragraph was 
explicitly added for a UAC that didn't add a 
From tag and couldn't distinguish an invite 
from re-invite.  This is no longer a 
possibility since email 
http://lists.bell-labs.com/pipermail/sip/2001q2/006912.html 
mentions the usage of tags is now mandatory for 
implementers of the timer draft.  Thus I 
agree that the text about adding Require timer 
and Session-Expires immediate can be removed.

I agree that a 481 is the best response when
a UAS chooses not to allow a dropped call-leg's 
session to be revived.

The RFC defines stateless and TRANSACTION stateful proxies.  What you are
talking about is a call stateful proxy, or a proxy that maintains states
across transactions.

The session timer draft defines a mechanism for a call stateful proxy to
determine the state of a call between transactions.

For more information, see the following entry in the SIP FAQ:

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/faq.cgi?_highlightWords=call%20stateful%
20proxy&file=36

Hi,

A comment about draft-ietf-sip-cc-transfer-04:

In page 8:
   ", the UA receiving the REFER SHOULD notify the agent sending 
   the refer using the NOTIFY mechanism.." 

I can imagine many situations (also outside of CC draft) in which the client
in some cases wants to be notified and in some cases does not want to be 
notified.

Is there any way to define this optionality in REFER ?
(other than new header)

I was thinking about caller prefs mechanism but it does not seem to allow
that possibility either.

I'd prefer that UAC sending REFER (or other non-SUBSCRIBE) method does 
not have to be automatically prepared to receive NOTIFYs (of course there 
is same Call-ID required but it is still inconvenient in some cases). 
Instead, the willingness to receive NOTIFY would be defined in
the non-SUBSCRIBE method itself (like in REFER).
 
Also, minor issue is that this is yet-another-extra-SIP-request/response 
which should be avoided in certain environments (e.g. wireless user in 
some cases may want to avoid unnecessary notifications).


This seems to be more general SIP issue, not limited to CC draft..

Petri

hi,
it was nice to see that someone was helping me to complete my work.i have a 
doubt in the Via Header.Now in one of the mails in mailing list archive it 
says that the Matching of Via Header means matching the 
Transport,Branch,Protocol Name(SIP),Version(2.0) and HostName.When u match a 
Hostname,if the hostname is normal name as in Via then it should me matched 
case-insensitivly,if the hostname is IP Address and the HostName in the Via 
Field is a String,how should the matching be done?.When Request is Received 
How does one Check that it is mulicast or not?.one more thing,how does a 
Proxy determine that a Request-URI of the request it has got is Correct,as 
seen by the proxy,does the Proxy maintain a List of Request-URI or what?.

There was quite a bit of discussion on this topic on the
list and at the meetings. In summary, the implicit subscribe
model was chosen at the SHOULD strength instead of MUST for
the very reasons you listed.

If you have an app where you have a very good reason to
not send the NOTIFY and you've done the work to ensure you're
not breaking any features that rely on it by accident, you aren't
required to send it.

Greetings All,

Regarding on an ISUP middle call messages (such as SUS/RES/INF/INR), how are
they interworked with SIP-T? Are they encapsulated in INFO message body?

Thanks for any return,
Alberto.

Hi,

Can someone help me understand this apparent contradition on the SIP bis
spec:

How can it be possible for "two instances of a user sharing a SIP address
... make call invitations with the same Call-ID" (section 6.26) if "The
callid
MUST be a globally unique identifier and MUSTNOT be reused for later
calls" (section 6.13)? [apart from the use of call-id in the REFER method,
where the transferee uses the same call-id of the transferor for the new
call
to the transfer-target].

Thanks,

Eber Mello

Hi,

It is still a MUST requirement for the client: (in page 8)

  "..the agent that issued the REFER MUST be prepared to receive a NOTIFY.."

There is no way to prevent NOTIFYs (in the case client does not want it).
Client may just hope that application does not send it.

This isn't major problem, but it would be nice to let the originating 
UAC (rather than the server processing REFER) to decide whether NOTIFY
is needed.

For example, new header for non-SUBSCRIBE methods like notify: yes|no.

I've seen some messages on this and I apologize for not responding sooner.

I am severely behind in updating information and getting drafts in and out
of Last Call. I won't bore you with why.

I am shooting to catch up by June 8th.

If anyone has any questions, please forward them to me.

Regards,

Rakesh

For the Music on Hold/Call Park in the SIP service examples draft,
it requires the User A (can be considered as the customer's SIP user
agent) to understand the Replaces header as in the
draft-biggs-sip-replaces-00.txt.

Why not just simply let the user B send INVITE to the Music server with
the customer's (user A) UA's RTP info and re-INVITE customer's UA with
Music server's RTP info to perform this service. The call flow is as the
following figure.

                A                   B                   C

The user B works like a B2BUA. Since it's the user B initiate the service,
it's reasonable to put the complexity in the user B's user agent instead
of adding complexity to user A (the customer)'s user agent.

And by this way, there is no need to use REFER and NOTIFY.

Hi,

In section 7, Retransmit Interval Computation of Reliability 
of Provisional  Responses in SIP draft ( 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-100rel-03.txt),

It is described that non-100 provisionals be retransmitted with
exponential backoff with a max retransmit interval of 32 secs. 
There is reference to behaviour of INVITE responses as described
in RFC2543.

While the BIS-02 draft for SIP describes that retransmit intervals
for INVITE final responses starts at T1 (500msecs) and 
caps at T2 (4 secs) interval.

Reliable Provisional Responses draft contradicts the
BIS-02 requirements.

Will the Reliability of Provisional Responses draft be updated
to match up with requirements of the BIS-02 or BIS-03 drafts ?

Thanks 

-- Sudipto

Xiaotao,

Your call flow will work - it is one way to implement this service.  It does,
however, require B to keep state on the session as long as the call is
parked.  If B disappears or fails, the call will not be able to be picked up.

Many services can be implemented using either SIP primitives such as REFER or
using B2BUA approaches.  I agree that this does simplify requirements for A,
but I believe that REFER and Replaces will be supported by most UAs.

Thanks,
Alan Johnston

Hello,

You can read 
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-isup-01.txt

for a complete answer.

SUS/RES are sent inside a re-INVITE. INF/INR inside INFO.

One final comment ...

I am not referring to COT on current leg (which is only important to the 
two ends of the
TDM connection).  Clearly this has no bearing on SIP-T.

I am referring to the COT on previous indication which is, in effect, an 
end to end indication
(or at least beyond the scope of the two ends of a TDM connection.)  The
downstream switches (that may be on the other side of the SIP network) 
normally DO
care about the COT on previous setting in the IAM and DO expect to set a COT
message even if that switch was not involved in a COT test.

This is why I thought it merited special attention.

Hi David,

In my opinion the ingress VoIP-GW should wait for a successful continuity indication for the cases "cot required" and "cot performed on previous circuit" before an INVITE is sent on the SIP side. In this case a distinction between interworking to SIP or SIP-T, respectively, is not necessary.

As a consequence it should not happen that SIP is envolved at all and that values different from "cot not required" can be reveived at the egress VoIP-GW in the encapsulated IAM.

Folks,

At long last, draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03 is now available. I have just
submitted it to the archives, and it will be available shortly from the IETF
site. In the meantime, you can pick up txt, ps, and pdf versions at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03.txt
http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03.pdf
http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03.ps

The pdf and ps have changebars marking the most significant changes. Folks
should be aware that the spec is generated using latex, and as a result, the
changebars are not created automatically, but manually. This means that
small, minor things (typos, minor corrections) may not have changebars.

The most significant changes in the spec are the entirely new SDP appendix,
and the new record-route text. See the changes section in the appendix for a
more comprehensive list of changes.

Thanks for your patience,
Jonathan R.

As part of the split of the SIP working group, we are reorganizing
the sip mail lists.

A new sip list has been established at ietf.org.  To subscribe to 
it, send a message to sip-request@ietf.org and specify "subscribe"
as the BODY of the message.

A new sipping list has been established at ietf.org.  To subscribe 
to it, send a message to sipping-request@ietf.ord, and specify "subscribe"
as the BODY of the message

The sip list sip@lists.bell-labs.com will be deactivated in 3 weeks.

As part of the transition, we ask that you immediately subscribe
to the list(s) of your choice, recalling that sip is the core 
protocol changes, and sipping is use of sip.  

IMPORTANT - Please DO NOT send messages to sip@ietf.org or sipping@ietf.org
yet.  Give everyone a chance to subscribe.  
I will post a message in about a week advising you to switch to 
the new list.  I will post a couple messages to the new lists just 
to assure you that the lists are working and you are subscribed.

About a week later, I'll suggest that you unsubscribe from
sip@lists.bell-labs.com (send a message to 
sip-request@lists.bell-labs.com, specify "unsubscribe" as the BODY 
of the message.  This will eliminate any double postings.

If you follow this sequence, there will never be a need to post
to both lists.  The experts on the list who answer questions will
follow the directions.  Posting to both list may annoy the folks
who would help you, so PLEASE, don't double post. 

Thanks for your co-operation

Brian

You are correct that a receiving agent can only expect
increasing CSeqs due to the opportunity for intervening
proxies to consume messages (with a 407 for example).

The remaining motivation for increasing by 1 on the sending
side, as I understand it, is preserving CSeq space.

Hi,
     Section 18.4 talks about DoS attacks using spoofed Via headers. The
situation described here however will not arise with simple Via spoofing
since the proxy will add a received parameter to the Via header and the
401/407 response is sent back to the originator. For such an attack, the
originator should also spoof the IP address. Is this what was meant here ?

Dr. Rosenberg -

I have questions concerning required timing synchronization within a
SIP-based voice network:

a. Which network elements within an SIP-based, IP network should be
synchronized?
Should IP Phones?  Mixers (Conference Bridges)?
Is NTP (SNTP) recommended for all devices?

b. Is end-point (IP phone-to-IP phone) synchronization required for RTP to
function properly?

The "old world" PSTN is dependent upon accurate timing and synchronization.
With packetized
voice, variable packet delay and loss can cause havoc with synchronization
and window processing.

c. Is a delayed, RTP encapsulated UDP packet ever "ignored" at the
destination device due to extraneous
packet delay or packet ordering?

I'm assuming for sipping you meant to say to send subscription requests to

         sipping-request@ietf.org

Already, there are three attempts to subscribe to the new lists by 
sending to the lists!!!

The mailman listmanager is bouncing these attempts to me.
This is just making work for me, and not getting you subscribed.
You send your subscription to sip-request@ietf.org or

It was brought to my attention that there is a typo in the
orginal message which says "sipping-request@ietf.ord", note the
last letter, should be "g" as in (goodness) ".org".
I wonder why my spell checker didn't catch it :)

Hi,

I am in the process of writting a paper about design a Simulator for SIP and
am looking to know which companies are working on SIM design and
implementation. Is there any list?

Sincerely,
Payman

None of them are required to be synchronised (expect if you are sending a
multimedia presentation from multiple machines and want to lip-sync the
result, in which case the sending systems need to be sync'd).

No.

The receiver needs to be smart enough to cope with variable delay, and to
reconstruct the timing.

Possibly, yes. It's application dependent, the standard does not specify
the behaviour.

Ah, the joys of reliable multicast.

That is the way it works now, yes. Ugly. Since CANCEL needs to be received
by all downstream servers in the multicast group, there is no other way to
do it without real reliable multicast.

I'd really rather not special case it, so it seems that the specified
default of 11 is fine.

Hi,

The call-flows draft shows a multi-proxy authentication scenario where a
client sends two Proxy-Authorization headers in a request message. The
Proxy-Authorization header grammar doesn't provide for multiple
Proxy-Authorization header instances in a message. Perhaps this grammar
needs to be defined differently for SIP instead of referring to the syntax
in the HTTP draft.

The other issue is regarding proxies optionally consuming or relaying the
credentials in a message. Wouldn't this add to the complexity of proxy
implementations for figuring out when to consume and when to leave it alone
? Wouldn't it be simpler if proxies never consumed the proxy-authorization
header and proxies expecting credentials tried out the entire list of
Proxy-Authorization headers for a match ? Also the draft currently does not
seem to specify if proxies should only check the topmost
Proxy-Authorization header if they are expecting a response to a challenge.

Some questions on the multi-proxy authentication scenario from
draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-03.txt:

How should the UAC figure out that the second 407 is from another server
than the first 407 came from, and not that the credentials sent to Proxy1
were wrong? In both cases the UAC sends the INVITE with the same
Request-URI I assume, and because the realm could be any text string,
both servers could have realm="SIP-Proxy". So what is the significant
difference that makes the UAC add two Proxy-Authorization headers
to the INVITE.

Another question is about the description of Proxy-Authenticate.The last
sentence states that: "The server responds with 401 (Unauthorized) if the
client guessed wrong". And the description for WWW-Authenticate states
that: "the WWW-Authenticate response-header MUST be included in 401".
But the handling of WWW-Authenticate seems to be totally different as it is
based on the To header while Proxy-Authenticate handling is based on the
Request-Uri. So how is a UAC supposed to handle this?

I also think that the description of Proxy-Authenticate is a bit strange as
it
talks a lot about the UAC "contacting a specific proxy server". Since when
did a SIP UAC actually know that it was going to contact a proxy server
and not a UAS, or a redirect server?

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
(signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet
multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia
distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or
via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.
SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions
which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.
SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to
the user's current location. Users can register their current
location.  SIP is not tied to any particular conference control
protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of the lower-layer
transport protocol and can be extended with additional capabilities.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-rfc2543bis-03.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

What should happen if a UAC sends an INVITE 
with Session-Expires and both Supported timer 
and Require timer?

What should happen if the UAS responds to such 
a request and includes the same the three 
headers and values?  Are both now effectively 
responsible for sending refreshes?  Or is the 
UAS forbidden from sending such a response?

Yes. I'll update the text to indicate that.

Way back when, we were considering fully distributed multiparty conferencing
models. In these models, each participant has a call leg to each other, each
with the same Call-ID and different tags. The problem arose when a user
would join the conference call from their desk, go to the lab to check
something, and attempt to join the conference from there. The user identity
is the same, as is the Call-ID. To distinguish, the From tag was needed.

Now, since then, we have found that fully distributed multiparty
conferencing is rather hard and really not worth the trouble, so this
becomes a non-issue.

However, From tags are now mandatory in bis-03, but for a different reason.
Without them, you cannot reliably distinguish a re-INVITE in the reverse
direction from an initial INVITE, and this can cause some problems in a few
scenarios (such as a crash and restart of the caller, or a response to a
re-INVITE from an intermediary proxy that adds a tag to the To field)

My apologies for the tardiness of this reply. I chose to spend all of my
"IETF cycles" on updating bis, instead of answering list email. Now that
bis-03 is back, its time to get back to the 450 unread sip list messages in
my inbox.

I could make the same point above for every single ISUP/ISDN parameter. I
suppose you would argue, then, that these too should therefore be added to
SIP?

Sounds like you are making the case for Proxy-Require here. Proxy-Require is
needed in a request if it cannot be processed correctly without
understanding the extension. Correctly, to me, implies that the result of
the call is what the customer expects. If they need to call customer support
every time they make a call, because it doesn't do the right thing, that
sounds like an extension that is mandatory.

This is a red herring. Once you've built devices which expect to see this
header, you now have to worry about the fact that existing proxies and UAs
won't insert it. 

I am really concerned about defining new extensions that effectively require
every single proxy to insert a new header for every single request, in order
to support proper operation of services which may occassionally get invoked.
The answer, "well, the customers will just call customer support", hardly
seems satisfactory.

Since the service is provided for the carriers benefit, don't you think the
carrier should determine what service is invoked when a request is sent to
the voicemail provider?

You have a whole bunch of assumptions here that I think are not right. First
off, I don't expect a carrier to work with THAT many voicemail providers all
at once. Maybe 3 or something like that. Secondly, there is absolutely,
positively no reason why the URI syntax would vary from end user to end
user, so your summation is irrelevant. Furthermore, even though voicemail
providers could, in principal, use different URI syntax as rfc3087
discusses, I suspect many would adopt common naming conventions (such as the
one spelled out in rfc3087). We've seen the same thing in dialing plans,
which have a few variants but are repeated alot across enterprise systems.

So, the configuration burden is not much different than between peer voip
carriers in a clearinghouse, who must agree on numbering plans and other URI
formatting conventions (which domain name to use, tel url vs. sip url,
etc.). 

So, realistically, this is not much of an administrative burden in a
gateway. You can always forward the call, using SIP-T, to some application
platform which does the same thing the gateway would otherwise do, if you
want to outsource the function.

I compare this burden, with the burden that Diversion requires - that every
proxy support it for all requests - and this configuration seems very minor.

Thats only if you perform the gateway function in this fashion. This is
exactly what I was talking about regarding considerations for backwards
compatibility.

When the proxy decides to call-forward-busy to the voicemail service, it
constructs a sip URL like:

sip:666222-5551114-dep-fb@gw-ip-address

which indicates the number of the voicemail server (666222) and then the
rest is the username, service, and reason as described in rfc3087.

You can argue that this is a configuration burden for a gateway compared to
diversion, but thats a red herring also. Both approaches carry two phone
numbers; both approaches require the gateway to know to look for both
numbers (in one case, it looks for Diversion, and in the other, looks for a
specific URI format). The huge difference is that one approach requires all
proxies to insert this header henceforth for all time, and the other does
not.

I would still like to understand how you propose handling the feature
interaction problem in such a manner. All the work in feature interaction to
date has been aimed at avoiding constructing such "policies" that consider
the interactions of all features in one piece of logic.

The voicemail provider serves the carrier. When the carrier sends a call to
the voicemail provider, presumably its because there was a specific service
the carrier wanted from the voicemail provider (i.e., leave a message). How
can you argue that the carrier has no place in dictating what the service is
that is provided by its service provider?

Let me give an analogy in another related space.

Lets say a carrier is providing conferencing services. It outsources that to
a conferencing provider. When a user makes a call to join the conference,
the provider forwards the call to a particular number (i.e., request URI) at
the conferencing provider. Applying your argument here, the conferencing
provider should determine which conference each user gets dropped into,
rather than it being dictated by the request URI as set by the provider (as
in draft-rosenberg-sip-conferencing-models and
draft-rosenberg-sip-app-components, where the R-URI identifies the
conference). The conferencing provider would sometimes look at the Subject
line, and mix together all calls with the same Subject. Or, maybe it keeps
lists of who likes who, and mixes together users who are known to be
friends. Clearly, I am being ridiculous, but it is to make a point. The
feature WILL NOT WORK as users expect unless there is a clear serviec
interface between the carrier and its conferencing provider. That service
interface dictates exactly what happens when a call is sent to that
provider. Without knowing that, the carrier has no way to know how and when
to send calls to the conferencing provider.

The notion of the request URI clearly identifying the resource to be
invoked, is at the heart of rfc3087, the app components architecture, and
the multiparty conferencing models. Do you believe that this approach is
flawed?

Fine enough. One can easily translate this request URI:

sip:666222-5551114-dep-fb@gw-ip-address

into the appropriate ISUP.

This would be true if you wanted to assume that the model for features and
services in ISUP should be the same as SIP. I'm not prepared to do that.

This is a big assumption. It will do the wrong thing in cases. As Anders has
pointed out, people use many different email addresses. In fact, within
dynamicsoft, I have both jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com and
jrosenberg@dynamicsoft.com. The latter is actually the "official" email
address which drives internal configurations. As a result, the dynamicsoft
proxy will need to translate jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com to
jrosenberg@dynamicsoft.com. This would be marked as a Diversion by your
approach. WHen this gets sent to the voicemail provider, what will happen?
No clue, of course, because with your approach there is no well defined
service interface. Its up to the "policy" of the provider. 

Here's another example, even more interesting. Someone calls
19749525000@dynamicsoft.com. This is our main number. When it reaches our
proxy, it gets translated to 5000@dynamicsoft.com, since we use 4 digit
extensions internally. So, here, the username has changed, but the end user
has not. 

Another funny one. Lets say I have a secretary, Jack D. Rosen, who is a
contractor for secretaries.com. A call comes for me, and rings my phone. I'm
not there. So, the proxy diverts, and forwards to Jack. Jacks email is
jdrosen@secretaries.com. Same username as me, but different domain. Now,
according to your algorithm, this won't be considered a diversion, and so if
Jack is not there, it drops to his voicemail instead of mine. Of course, had
my voicemail application running in my domain been EXPLICIT and specifically
tried to drop a message to my voicemail, it would work.

These are all symptoms of a system whereby applications are invoked
implicitly by trying to guess the sequence of logic and behaviors in
upstream devices which resulted in the call being delivered to it.

Well, even if this were true, and it isn't, every proxy that modifies the
r-URI username would need to insert a diversion header, since it can't know
whether a voicemail server might be reached downstream. Thus, in order for
the voicemail service to work with high reliability, every proxy server that
changes the request URI username must always insert this, which means its a
Proxy-Require (and I have argued that it will need to be there even when the
R-URI username doesn't change, since the proxy can't know reliably whether
its a diversion.)

The insidious problem I am pointing out is that my CPL-based proxy doesn't
know which of these new reason codes are used by the "policy" of some
downstream voicemail server. For things to work reliably, it would need to
support every single one of them that is ever defined. Of course, you would
need to define lots of them to provide more and more cooler voicemail drop
features. Had you instead put the voicemail logic in the same place as that
proxy, you would need none.

Sparks "Providing for Multiple-Proxy Authentication of a SIP Request"


http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg/drafts/draft-sparks-sip-multiproxy-auth-00.txt

The call flows draft is purely informational, not normative.  All normative
changes were to be included in bis to make this call flow work.

<FontFamily><param>Courier</param>ITU-T Study Group 11 has initiated a work 
program to define signalling requirements for 
the interworking of SIP with BICC (Bearer 
Independent Call Control) and with ISUP (ISDN 
User Part of Signalling System 7).  It is the 
understanding of SG11 that the IETF will 
continue to focus its energy on SIP protocol 
development and would look to the ITU-T to 
develop interworking signalling requirements and 
protocols.


SG 11 has scheduled three meetings before 
February 2002 to advance its efforts in this 
subject.  A strong consensus exists among the 
participants of this Study Group that a common 
approach should be taken for both BICC and ISUP.


SG 11 plans to keep the IETF informed of any 
requirements for extensions to SIP that may 
develop from its studies and looks forward to 
further communications as this study progresses.

Hi, Everyone:
 
Question Q.F/16 of ITU-T SG16 is fully dedicated for developing standards
for "End-to-End QOS for Multimedia Applications". Contributions are also
being under discussion in the ITU-T SG16 Brazil May 28 - June 8, 2001
meeting.
 
Applications like H.323, SIP, H.324, H.310, and others will also be able to
use this Q.F/16's QOS signaling protocol. MEGACO/H.248 and BICC will also be
able to use this when specs are fully developed and, TIPHON's QOS mechanisms
can also be used as one of the mechanisms for implementations.
 
BICC and MEGCAO/H.248 are only used as the protocol between the gateways,
NOT end-to-end (although SIP/H.323 or other protocols may be used between
the gateways).
 
The "End-to-End QOS for Multimedia Applications" of SG16 can also be termed
as "Application Layer QOS."
 
Q.F/16's end-to-end application layer QOS can also be implemented over the
network layer QOS like RSVP, DiffServe, and/or MPLS after proper mapping.
Similar is the case for the ATM network.
 
Please note that the network layer QOS (e.g., RSVP, DiffServe, and/or MPLS)
may or may not have the end-to-end significance. For example, an IP network
may implement different QOS schemes in different domains (e.g., RVSP in one
domain, DiffServ in another domain). 
 
However, the application layer QOS is end-to-end that remains the same. For
example, an H.323 or SIP call that can traverse several IP domains where
each domain may implement its own network layer QOS schemes while the
H.323/SIP call carry the signaling messages and QOS parameters end-to-end
independent of the underlying network layer QOS mechanisms.
 
Let us work together.
 
Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy
AT&T

Subject: PROPOSED JOINT ACTIVITY ON A GENERIC PROTOCOL MECHANISM FOR
END-TO-END QOS SERVICE CONTROL



This message was agreed to at ITU-T Study Group 11 meeting (Geneva, May
2001) and is being transmitted on behalf of Yukio Hiramatsu, Chairman of
ITU-T SG 11. For further technical clarification, contact the Rapporteur for
Q9/11 (Rolfe Buhrke, Tel: + 1 630 713 7022, { HYPERLINK

FULL TITLE: PROPOSED JOINT ACTIVITY ON A GENERIC PROTOCOL MECHANISM FOR
END-TO-END QOS SERVICE CONTROL AND SIGNALLING PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT BASED ON
IP TRANSFER CAPABILITIES AND IP QOS CLASSES 




General



Within ITU-T SG11 work has started on requirements for a generic protocol
mechanism for end-to-end QoS service control. It was agreed within SG11 to
proceed with this work utilising deliverables of ETSI TIPHON on end- to-end
QoS service control as base material. It is the opinion of SG11 that this
generic protocol mechanism for BICC intends to apply also to other protocols
like SIP/SDP and H.323 next to generic extensions to the H.248/MEGACO
protocol.



It was noted that also QoS related work is in progress in IETF. Please find
attached an initial draft of the BICC CS3 signalling requirements for
end-to-end QoS service control. Please note the rationale for this activity
and the framework for end-to-end QoS service control and network QoS
control. The framework illustrates the field of application of the QoS
handling at different levels and the different protocols involved.




Proposals on end-to-end QoS service control



It is proposed to start a joint activity with IETF on a generic protocol
mechanism for end- to-end QoS service control. This refers to the potential
work in IETF on the following topics:



- Identification of the signalling requirements based on the ETSI TIPHON
defined speech QoS service classes for VoIP and the signalling and control
of end-to-end QoS for VoIP. The attachment provides the initial draft of the
BICC CS3 signalling requirements for end-to-end QoS service control.



- The definition of a generic call/bearer control mechanism in H.225/H.245,
SIP/SDP and BICC CS3 for end-to-end QoS service control in the application
plane.



- The definition of generic extensions to H.248/MEGACO for end-to-end QoS
service control between the application plane and the transport plane.



- The translation between the generic protocol QoS information elements in
H.248/MEGACO and the technology specific QoS parameters and QoS mechanisms
in IP, ATM, MPLS, etc.




Proposals on IP QoS classes and IP Transfer Capabilities



ITU-T SG11 would like to inform IETF that it is investigating signalling
requirements for protocol development based on the IP Transfer Capabilities
and IP QoS classes, as being defined by ITU-T SG13 in Y.1541 and Y.iptc. The
plan is to build upon signalling approaches developed by IETF. We would like
to stress that the work on IP QoS classes and IP Transfer Capabilities by
ITU-T SG13 is co- ordinated with IETF.

for end-to-end QoS service control.

BICC CS3 signalling requirements for end-to- end QoS service control



EDITORS' NOTE:  This requirements text for end-to-end QoS service control is
a first draft text and requires extensive updating based on liaison
activities with other groups



1 Rationale



The rationale of the BICC CS3 requirements for end-to-end service control is
based on the analysis made by ETSI TIPHON (see the presentation available at
the URL: http://docbox.etsi.org/tech-
org/tiphon/Document/tiphon/ARCHIVES/2000/05- 200012-
Kyoto/WG5%20TIPHON21%20presentation%20Rev1.ppt ). It shows the
inter-relationship between the different QoS factors that finally determine 


the perceived speech quality by the end- users. This perceived speech
quality does not only depend on network quality of service (network packet
loss, network jitter and network delay) but on the terminal implementation
(jitter buffers and codec performance) as well. 





A second rationale is that end-to-end QoS requirements can be regarded as
end-to-end quality budgets related to the media flows. To achieve the
required end-to-end QoS these quality budgets must be allocated between the
domains, including the user equipment (see Figure 7 in ETSI TS 301 329 part
3). The Transport QoS Parameters specify the QoS budgets for each Transport
Domain. It is assumed that the performance of each domain is statistically
independent from any other.





Therefore end-to-end QoS service control at the call control level (i.e.
application plane) is required based on generic signalling procedures in
protocols like BICC, SIP/SDP, H.323 and H.248/MEGACO for end-to- end QoS
service control.




2 Framework for end-to-end QoS service control and network QoS control.



A framework for QoS control may be considered at different levels: call
control (BICC, SIP/SDP, H.323), vertical control (H.248/MEGACO, CBC), bearer
control (IP BCP) and bearer (DiffServ, IntServ/RSVP or MPLS/LDP).



1) Call-control 



a) End-to-end QoS service control is negotiated/communicated end-to-end at
the call control level. ETSI TIPHON has defined a set of speech QoS classes,
and signalling requirements and flows for this purpose. 



The idea is that call control protocols are enhanced with a generic
end-to-end QoS service control mechanism to negotiate these speech QoS
classes and associated parameters (Maximum delay, Maximum packet delay
variation, Maximum packet loss, Peak bit rate and Maximum packet size). 



Such a generic end-to-end QoS service control mechanism should be defined
independent of the underlying technology (ATM or IP) and operate across
network domains and including terminal characteristics to
negotiate/communicate the requested listener speech quality that will be
perceived by the end-users (i.e. "mouth-to-ear").



b) BICC (Q.190x) is one of the call control protocols that may be enhanced
this way. Similar enhancements may be applicable to other call-control
protocols like SIP/SDP and H.323.




2) Vertical control 



a) QoS service control is also negotiated/communicated at the vertical
control level. The ETSI TIPHON defined signalling requirements and flows
include the vertical interface. The idea is that vertical control protocols
are enhanced to negotiate/communicate the QoS settings (Maximum delay,
Maximum packet delay variation, Maximum packet loss, Peak bit rate and
Maximum packet size) in the bearer core network based on generic
H.248/MEGACO extensions.



These QoS settings should be defined independent of the underlying
technology (ATM or IP) of the bearer core network.



b) CBC (Q.1950) is one of the vertical control protocols that may be
enhanced this way.




3) Bearer control 



a) Network QoS is negotiated/communicated at the bearer control level. ATM
signalling does already intrinsically support network QoS. SG13 has recently
defined IP QoS classes and IP Transfer Capabilities. 



The idea is that bearer control protocols for IP are enhanced with a
mechanism to negotiate the network QoS by using IP QoS classes and IP
Transfer Capabilities. 



b) IP BCP (Q.1970) is an IP bearer control protocol that may be enhanced
this way.




4) Bearer 



a) Network QoS is negotiated/communicated at the bearer level, i.e. as part
of the protocols associated with the bearers in the core network. The idea
is that IP QoS classes and IP Transfer Capabilties, as defined by SG13, are
used to differentiate between different types of IP traffic.



b) IP QoS classes and IP Transfer Capabilities may be used to enhance
existing IP mechanisms like DiffServ, IntServ/RSVP and MPLS/LDP.






3 QoS information flows applicable to BICC



A general model is considered for QoS information flows with BICC when
making a translation of the relevant parts in Figure 8 in ETSI TS 301 329
part 3.





Section 4 details the Q.BICC related QoS primitives and parameters based on
the QoS primitives and parameters in the ETSI deliverable. Similarly,
section 5 provides the Q.CBC related QoS primitives and parameters.




4 Q.BICC related QoS primitives and parameters



The Q.BICC related QoS primitives and parameters are extracted from clause
8.1 and clause 8.2 of ETSI TS 101 329 part 3.



4.1 Q.BICC related QoS primitives



This information flow (QC2 in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3) communicates the QoS
related bearer information between the domains of different service
providers. 



Q.BICC QoS request (Qbicc.QoSreq) requests the establishment of a bearer
conforming to a particular ETSI TIPHON Class of Service or with defined QoS
characteristics.



NOTE    Identical to QoSM request (QC2.QoSMreq) in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3
clause 8.1.1.



Q.BICC QoS confirm (Qbicc.QoSconf) acknowledges the creation of a bearer
conforming to a requested ETSI TIPHON QoS Class or with specified QoS
characteristics.



NOTE    Identical to QoSM confirm (QC2.QoSMconf) in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3
clause 8.1.1.



Q.BICC QoS reject (Qbicc.QoSrej) rejects the creation of a bearer conforming
to a requested ETSI TIPHON QoS Class or with specified QoS characteristics.



NOTE    Identical to QoSM reject (QC2.QoSMrej) in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3
clause 8.1.1.



Q.BICC release request (Qbicc.QoSrelreq) requests the release of a bearer.



NOTE    Identical to QoSM release request (QC2.QoSMrelreq) in ETSI TS 101
329 part 3 clause 8.1.1 and the release of a transport flow is already
covered by existing Q.BICC procedures in Q.1902 series.



QoSM release confirm (Qbicc.QoSrelconf) confirms the release of a bearer.



NOTE    Identical to QoSM release confirm (QC2.QoSMrelconf) in ETSI TS 101
329 part 3 clause 8.1.1 and the release of a transport flow is already
covered by existing Q.BICC procedures in Q.1902 series.




4.2 Q.BICC related QoS parameters



Table 1 lists the parameters used in the Q.BICC related QoS primitives not
yet covered by the Q.BICC protocol. The deleted items refer to the
information elements already covered by the BICC CS2 protocol in the Q.1902
series.



NOTE    The contents of Table 1 is an interpretation of the table in ETSI TS
101 329 part 3 clause 8.2.3.

                  Packet Transport Protocol Optional [Default UDP]



Qbicc.QoSrej      Reason [TBD]                    Mandatory




5 Q.CBC related QoS primitives and parameters



The Q.CBC related QoS primitives and parameters are extracted from clause
8.1 and clause 8.2 of ETSI TS 101 329 part 3.



5.1 Q.CBC related QoS primitives 



This information flow (QT2 in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3) communicates the QoS
related transport flow information between a service domain and an
associated transport domain. This information contains the QoS related
characteristics required of the transport flows that will carry the media
flow and the properties of the media flow.



Q.CBC QoS request (Qcbc.QoSreq) requests the establishment of a transport

reservation of Transport Domain resource.



NOTE    Identical to TRM QoS request (QT2.TRMQreq) in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3
clause 8.1.3.



Q.CBC QoS confirm (Qcbc.QoSconf) acknowledges the creation of a requested
transport flow or the reservation of Transport Domain resource.



NOTE    Identical to TRM QoS confirm (QT2.TRMQconf) in ETSI TS 101 329 part
3 clause 8.1.3.



Q.CBC QoS reject (Qcbc.QoSrej) rejects the creation of a requested transport
flow or the reservation of Transport Domain resource.



NOTE    Identical to TRM QoS reject (QT2.TRMQrej) in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3
clause 8.1.3.



Q.CBC QoS release request (Qcbc.QoSrelreq) requests the release of a
transport flow.



NOTE    Identical to TRM QoS release request (QT2.TRM QoS relreq) in ETSI TS
101 329 part 3 clause 8.1.3. The release of a transport flow is already
covered by the existing Q.CBC procedures in Q.1950.



Q.CBC QoS release confirm (Qcbc.QoSrelconf) confirms the release of a
transport flow.



NOTE    Identical to TRM QoS release confirm (QT2.TRM QoS relconf) in ETSI
TS 101 329 part 3 clause 8.1.3. The release of a transport flow is already
covered by the existing Q.CBC procedures in Q.1950.



Q.CBC QoS performance notification (Qcbc.QoSperfnotif) notifies the Service
Domain of the performance of the Transport Domain in meeting the requested
QoS levels. This may be a periodic event or an urgent alarm. Note: this
primitive is a management primitive and its use is for further study.



NOTE    Identical to TRM QoS performance notification (QT2.TRM QoS
perfnotif) in ETSI TS 101 329 part 3 clause 8.1.3. For further study.




5.2 Q.CBC related QoS parameters



Table 2 lists the parameters used in the Q.CBC related QoS primitives not
yet covered by the Q.CBC protocol. The deleted items refer to the
information elements already covered by the BICC CS2 protocol in Q.1950. 



NOTE    The contents of Table 2 is an interpretation of the table in ETSI TS
101 329 part 3 clause 8.2.5.

7 Information flows and signalling procedures for end-to-end QoS service
control



EDITORS' NOTE   The information flows and signalling procedures for
end-to-end QoS service control may be considered to follow the same
principles as the already existing procedures for end-to-end codec
negotiation in BICC CS1 and BICC CS2. Similarly mid-call procedures for
end-to-end QoS modification and mid-call QoS modification may be considered
because the perceived QoS is highly related to the codec type employed end-
to-end as part of the connection. The exact scope and properties of these
procedures and protocol message flows needs further discussion.

This is very confusing.   "End-to-End QOS for Multimedia Applications"
is an really important topic, but this topic must be a superset of
"End-to-End QOS signaling".  There are much harder problems than
signaling in providing E2E QoS.  Can you explain how signaling relates
to the title of this working party?

Thanks,

Bob Braden

hi,
  I want to know how  SIP requests  will traverse more  than one Proxy
wihle reaching the destination,
  What happens if the second proxy server inserts the record route header
to the request.
  please give me a clarification regarding this if possible with an
example. Thanks
Ravi.B.S.

I should just like to clarify the background to this "message". It was 
generated in the final minutes of the SG 11 closing plenary after 
completion of working party reports and liaison statements when many 
delegates, myself included, had left for the airport and not during the 
discussions of Questions 6, 9 and 11. With regard to the final paragraph, 
there was no agreement during the joint question 6 and 9 activity on SIP 
interworking that SG 11 would work on identifying requirements for 
extensions to SIP. The second sentence of the first paragraph also presumes 
too much.

Also, I assume that the relevant parties are aware of the IETF efforts
in SIP-to-ISUP interworking (draft-ietf-sip-isup, et al.). The message
below does not seem to indicate this ("would look to the ITU-T to
develop interworking signalling requirements and protocols.")

Proxies in different Realms (administrative domains) need
to be sure they provide unique realm strings. This is the
key the _end user_ needs to differentiate the source of
challenges.

Where do you get the idea that WWW-Authenticate is based on a To:

PROTOCOL MECHANISM FOR END-TO-END QOS SERVICE 
CONTROL AND <color><param>0100,0100,0100</param>SIGNALLING PROTOCOL DEVELO=

ON IP TRANSFER CAPABILITIES AND IP QOS CLASSES




<paraindent><param>right</param><FontFamily><param>Courier New</param>Gene=
ral</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>Within ITU-T SG11 work has started on 
requirements for a generic protocol mechanism 
for end-to-end QoS service control. It was 
agreed within SG11 to proceed with this work 
utilising deliverables of ETSI TIPHON on end-
to-end QoS service control as base material. 
It is the opinion of SG11 that this generic 
protocol mechanism for BICC intends to apply 
also to other protocols like SIP/SDP and 
H.323 next to generic extensions to the 
H.248/MEGACO protocol.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>It was noted that also QoS related work is=
 in 
progress in IETF. Please find attached an 
initial draft of the BICC CS3 signalling 
requirements for end-to-end QoS service 
control. Please note the rationale for this 
activity and the framework for end-to-end QoS 
service control and network QoS control. The 
framework illustrates the field of 
application of the QoS handling at different 
levels and the different protocols involved.</paraindent>



<paraindent><param>right</param>Proposals on end-to-end QoS service contro=
l</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>It is proposed to start a joint activity w=
ith 
IETF on a generic protocol mechanism for end-
to-end QoS service control. This refers to 
the potential work in IETF on the following 
topics:</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>- Identification of the signalling 
requirements based on the ETSI TIPHON defined 
speech QoS service classes for VoIP and the 
signalling and control of end-to-end QoS for 
VoIP. The attachment provides the initial 
draft of the BICC CS3 signalling requirements 
for end-to-end QoS service control.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>- The definition of a generic call/bearer 
control mechanism in H.225/H.245, SIP/SDP and 
BICC CS3 for end-to-end QoS service control 
in the application plane.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>- The definition of generic extensions to 
H.248/MEGACO for end-to-end QoS service 
control between the application plane and the 
transport plane.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>- The translation between the generic 
protocol QoS information elements in 
H.248/MEGACO and the technology specific QoS 
parameters and QoS mechanisms in IP, ATM, 
MPLS, etc.</paraindent>



<paraindent><param>right</param>Proposals on IP QoS classes and IP Transfe=
r 
Capabilities</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>ITU-T SG11 would like to inform IETF that =
it 
is investigating signalling requirements for 
protocol development based on the IP Transfer 
Capabilities and IP QoS classes, as being 
defined by ITU-T SG13 in Y.1541 and Y.iptc. 
The plan is to build upon signalling 
approaches developed by IETF. We would like 
to stress that the work on IP QoS classes and 
IP Transfer Capabilities by ITU-T SG13 is co-
ordinated with IETF.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param>EDITORS=92 NOTE:	This requirements text fo=
r 
end-to-end QoS service control is a first 
draft text and requires extensive updating 
based on liaison activities with other groups</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>1 Rationale</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>The rationale of the BICC CS3 requirements=
 
for end-to-end service control is based on 
the analysis made by ETSI TIPHON (see the 
presentation available at the URL: 
http://docbox.etsi.org/tech-
org/tiphon/Document/tiphon/ARCHIVES/2000/05-
200012-
Kyoto/WG5%20TIPHON21%20presentation%20Rev1.ppt
). It shows the inter-relationship between 
the different QoS factors that finally 
determine </paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param>the perceived speech quality by the end-
users. This perceived speech quality does not 
only depend on network quality of service 
(network packet loss, network jitter and 
network delay) but on the terminal 
implementation (jitter buffers and codec 
performance) as well. </paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param> </paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param>A second rationale is that end-to-end QoS 
requirements can be regarded as end-to-end 
quality budgets related to the media flows. 
To achieve the required end-to-end QoS these 
quality budgets must be allocated between the 
domains, including the user equipment (see 
Figure 7 in ETSI TS 301 329 part 3). The 
Transport QoS Parameters specify the QoS 
budgets for each Transport Domain. It is 
assumed that the performance of each domain 
is statistically independent from any other.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param> </paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param>Therefore end-to-end QoS service control a=
t 
the call control level (i.e. application 
plane) is required based on generic 
signalling procedures in protocols like BICC, 
SIP/SDP, H.323 and H.248/MEGACO for end-to-
end QoS service control.</paraindent>



<paraindent><param>right</param>2 Framework for end-to-end QoS service 
control and network QoS control.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>A framework for QoS control may be conside=
red 
at different levels: call control (BICC, 
SIP/SDP, H.323), vertical control 
(H.248/MEGACO, CBC), bearer control (IP BCP) 
and bearer (DiffServ, IntServ/RSVP or 
MPLS/LDP).</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>1) Call-control </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>a) End-to-end QoS service control is 
negotiated/communicated end-to-end at the 
call control level. ETSI TIPHON has defined a 
set of speech QoS classes, and signalling 
requirements and flows for this purpose. </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>The idea is that call control protocols ar=
e 
enhanced with a generic end-to-end QoS 
service control mechanism to negotiate these 
speech QoS classes and associated parameters 
(Maximum delay, Maximum packet delay 
variation, Maximum packet loss, Peak bit rate 
and Maximum packet size). </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>Such a generic end-to-end QoS service cont=
rol 
mechanism should be defined independent of 
the underlying technology (ATM or IP) and 
operate across network domains and including 
terminal characteristics to 
negotiate/communicate the requested listener 
speech quality that will be perceived by the 
end-users (i.e. "mouth-to-ear").</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>b) BICC (Q.190x) is one of the call contro=
l 
protocols that may be enhanced this way. 
Similar enhancements may be applicable to 
other call-control protocols like SIP/SDP and 
H.323.</paraindent>



<paraindent><param>right</param>2) Vertical control </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>a) QoS service control is also 
negotiated/communicated at the vertical 
control level. The ETSI TIPHON defined 
signalling requirements and flows include the 
vertical interface. The idea is that vertical 
control protocols are enhanced to 
negotiate/communicate the QoS settings 
(Maximum delay, Maximum packet delay 
variation, Maximum packet loss, Peak bit rate 
and Maximum packet size) in the bearer core 
network based on generic H.248/MEGACO 
extensions.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>These QoS settings should be defined 
independent of the underlying technology (ATM 
or IP) of the bearer core network.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>b) CBC (Q.1950) is one of the vertical 
control protocols that may be enhanced this 
way.</paraindent>



<paraindent><param>right</param>3) Bearer control </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>a) Network QoS is negotiated/communicated =
at 
the bearer control level. ATM signalling does 
already intrinsically support network QoS. 
SG13 has recently defined IP QoS classes and 
IP Transfer Capabilities. </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>The idea is that bearer control protocols =
for 
IP are enhanced with a mechanism to negotiate 
the network QoS by using IP QoS classes and 
IP Transfer Capabilities. </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>b) IP BCP (Q.1970) is an IP bearer control=
 
protocol that may be enhanced this way.</paraindent>



<paraindent><param>right</param>4) Bearer </paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>a) Network QoS is negotiated/communicated =
at 
the bearer level, i.e. as part of the 
protocols associated with the bearers in the 
core network. The idea is that IP QoS classes 
and IP Transfer Capabilties, as defined by 
SG13, are used to differentiate between 
different types of IP traffic.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>b) IP QoS classes and IP Transfer 
Capabilities may be used to enhance existing 
IP mechanisms like DiffServ, IntServ/RSVP and 
MPLS/LDP.</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param> </paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param>3 QoS information flows applicable to BICC=
</paraindent>


<paraindent><param>right</param>A general model is considered for QoS 
information flows with BICC when making a 
translation of the relevant parts in Figure 8 
in ETSI TS 301 329 part 3.</paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param> </paraindent>

<paraindent><param>right</param>Section 4 details the Q.BICC related QoS

the Q.CBC related QoS primitives and

Hi, Bob:

All applications (e.g., H.323, SIP) uses signaling messages among its
functional entities (e.g., terminal, agents, gatekeepers, proxies, gateways)
for communications.

The signaling messages that carry QOS parameters are treated as QOS
signaling messages. The applications like SIP and H.323 send signaling
messages end-to-end. H.323 uses H.225.0 RAS, Q.931, Annex G, and H.245
signaling protocols.  SIP also uses SDP as a part of the signaling messages.


The signaling messages that carry QOS related information can be treated as
"End-to-End QOS signaling" messages.

Kindly see the ongoing works of Q.F/16 of SG16. This will provide more
information related to your questions.

Hope this helps.

Best regards,
Radhika R. Roy

This is very confusing.   "End-to-End QOS for Multimedia Applications"
is an really important topic, but this topic must be a superset of
"End-to-End QOS signaling".  There are much harder problems than
signaling in providing E2E QoS.  Can you explain how signaling relates
to the title of this working party?

Thanks,

Bob Braden

I got it from 10.48 WWW-Authenticate (bis-03). The second part states
that: "A user agent SHOULD cache the authorization credentials for a
given value of the destination (To header) and realm ...".

But the main question is still that an UAC that re-sends a request
after receiving a 407 can get a 401 back, which MUST have a
WWW-Authenticate header. I thougth this 401/WWW-Authenticate response
would mean the UAC was beeing queried for authentication by an UAS
(not Proxy) and that the next request should have a Authorization
header added to it. But all I wanted from the beginning was to get
through a proxy...

19.1, 3:rd sentence also seems to indicate that a proxy server isn't
allowed to send 401s:
"The 401 response is used by user agent servers in SIP to challenge
the authorization of a user agent client. Additionally, registrars and
redirect servers MAY make use of 401 responses for authorization, but
proxies MUST NOT, and instead MAY use the 407 response."


Shouldnt the proxy just send another 407 with Proxy-Authenticate if
the credentials were wrong? Then the UAC would know that it is a
Proxy-Authorization header it should provide in the next request.

Folks, this thread may or may not be the start of something good or
evil, but it is going out to too many lists!

Please, as of now, let's move it to one, and only one list.
I nominate tsvwg.  If you are replying to any message on this
thread, PLEASE edit the to/cc to limit it to tsvwg@ietf.org

Hi,

1. From Section B.3.1 (3rd paragraph):

"If the stream in the answer is marked as sendrecv, it MUST contain at 
least one codec the answerer is willing to both send and receive with, 
from amongst those listed in the offer. The stream MAY indicate 
additional codes, not listed in the corresponding stream in the offer, 
that the answerer is willing to receive with."

My comment is on the last sentence. It seems rather odd that somebody 
can list a codec as recv only in a media stream that is send and recv.  
Is this a typo? The last sentence should read as: "The stream ..., that 
the answerer is willing to send and receive with."

2. Immediately after the quoted sentences, I propose that we add the 
following text:

"If more than one codec are listed in the answer, the answerer and 
offerer may choose different codecs to send media, leading to asymmetric 
codecs being used for send and receive. Furthermore,  even for the same 
codec, the answerer and offerer may choose different packetization sizes 
because the indication of packetization time is not mandatory in SDP."

I'd rather see that the SIP spec requires only one codec listed in the 
answer and mandates usage of ptime, for reasons that I elaborated in my 
earlier postings. If people out there think otherwise, at least we need 
to point out the consequences. 

3. From Section B.4 (4th paragraph):

"..., the new SDP MUST have a matching media section for each media 
section in the previous SDP. ... This matching is necessary in order for 
the answerer to determine which stream in the new SDP corresponds to a 
stream in the previous SDP."

I think the idea of "matching media" is completely bogus as described in 
bis-03. Compare the 2nd and 3rd examples in Section B.5. Are the first m 
lines in these two SDPs supposed to match with each other? What if the 
media has changed? Consider the following two SDPs:

SDP1:
m=audio 2400 RTP/AVP 0
m=video 3600 RTP/AVP 31

SDP2:
m=video 3600 RTP/AVP 31
m=audio 2402 RTP/AVP 0

The only thing that has changed is the audio port from 2400 to 2402. But 
since I am allowed to change media type, I can change the order of the m 
lines. We can always refuse/delete a media stream by setting the port to 
0. I don't understand why one needs to change the media type.

Regards,

Shan Lu

I'm not sure why that's there. It implies that I (the user) will have to
reenter my proxy credentials every time I call someone new. I don't think
that's what was intended. Jonathan?

If you got a 401, you got through. The Proxy-Authorization worked. The 
401 had to have come from something on the other side of the proxy.
Your next request would have _both_ a Proxy-Authorization header (to
get back through the proxy) and an Authorization header destined for
the thing that sent the 401.

This says a proxy won't _generate_ a 401, but doesn't prevent it
from forwarding one.

That is exactly the expected behavior.

hello all,

could any one explain what a SIP UA has to do for a -ve response for a HOLD
and HOLD retrieve messages. And how long a UA could remain in held state.

Thanks
S.Kumar

Ok, it seems like we both agree on this. But take a look at 10.31 in
bis-03, last sentence. I think it trying to say that if I send the
wrong credentials to a 407/Proxy-Authentication I will get a 401 back!

Just put all the parts together, removing unencoded

obvious enough, but I'm at a loss to explain others. Here we go:

So http://docbox.etsi.org/ is passworded but docs can be retrieved by
advertised public direct url? Bizarre.

Folks,

This is *not* a discussion item for the diffserv WG mailing list. This WG is not 
chartered to discuss signalling issues. Whether the ITU should work on this
and if so how it should collaborate with the IETF should be discussed at liaison
level, not on a list with a few hundred people. So please everybody drop this
discussion on the diffserv list and continue elswhere.

To achieve the required end-to-end QoS these quality budgets must be allocated between the domains, including the user equipment (see Figure 7 in ETSI TS 301 329 part 3). The Transport QoS Parameters specify the QoS budgets for each Transport Domain. It is assumed that the performance of each domain is statistically independent from any other.

The exact scope and properties of these procedures and protocol message flows needs further discussion.

so the talk seems to be dated dec 2001, and makes me wonder if the
tiphon folks have achieved a breakthru in QOS
with e2e delays better than 0ms.....

meanwhile, i stuck html versions of the files below at
ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/tiphon/
(prob. doesnt help non windoze users since the html is generated by
office 2000 apps so unless you have the unix internet explorer, too
bad)

hello all,

could any one explain what a SIP UA has to do for a -ve response for a HOLD
and HOLD retrieve messages. And how long a UA could remain in held state.

Thanks

Hi, Baker:

It appears that a good amount discussion can be started to answer your
questions (what has being discussed for the last couple of years in the
ITU-T and TIPHON in particular). I am not trying to do so. Let me answer
your questions summarizing the key points as follows:

1. Broadly, all applications can be considered in two categories: a.
Real-time (e.g., audio, video [of H.323/SIP]) and b. Non-Real-time (e.g.,
data applications like file transfer, WWW, Mail, etc. - can a part of
H.323/SIP). 

The performance parameters of both real-time (audio, video) and
non-real-time (data) traffic can be abstracted in an universal way that can
be used by all applications (e.g., H.323, SIP, WWW, mail, etc). 

However, the signaling messages used by each application are
application-specific although the QOS parameters used by all of them still
remain same (e.g., H.323 might use RAS/Q.931/Annex-G/H.245 signaling
messages, SIP might use SDP). 

The QOS signaling messages that use QOS parameters can be termed as the
application layer QOS signaling messages and are sent on end-to-end basis
and the values of those QOS parameters do not change no matter what may be
the underlying transport networks (e.g., IP, ATM).

2. The network layer QOS signaling messages carried over the network may not
be end-to-end significance. For example, an end-to-end path of an IP network
may consist of RSVP, DiffServ, MPLS, and RSVP. So, the network layer QOS
parameters may get translated between the source-destination path and may
not remain the same what has been negotiated on end-to-end basis in the
application layer (item 1).

The problems that are being addressed are as follows:

A. How to develop the end-to-end QOS signaling mechanisms in the application
layer

B. How to relate the application layer QOS signaling to the network layer
QOS signaling (e.g., RSVP, DifServ, MPLS, etc.) so that one-to-one
consistency remain between the application and network layer QOS parameters.

Hope this may clarify some of your questions.

I'm not sure we're on the same planet. Please help me out here.

I can think of a few applications that have agents, gatekeepers, proxies, 
and gateways, mostly resulting from the imposition of firewalls or 
authentication systems, or from legacy applications like imitating the 
telephone system in a data network. The only one that *requires* any kind 
of gateway, to my knowledge, is H.323 teleconferencing, which represents a 
paltry fraction of traffic according to most current measurements. Anything 
else (75% of Internet traffic is http or FTP, most of the rest is mail, on 
private LANs applications like NFS are pretty common, and even SIP can be 
done without a gateway between consenting systems) could be hooked up in 
separate systems on a LAN and made to work without any such signalling at
all.

Could you be more specific on what QoS signalling is required by the world 
wide web, mail, FTP, common ERP applications like ERP and PeopleSoft, 
calendaring, and so on? If not, could you be more specific about what "all" 
applications you have in mind?

And could you be more specific about what issues this proposal is 
addressing that have not already been addressed in de facto standards and 
deployed in operational systems? It would be very nice to understand what 
you are preparing to ask vendors to do, and whether operators are 
interested in deploying them.

Kumar,

consider the following scenario:

User A  and User B are in a call.
User A  sends a mid call INVITE request to User C that places the existing
call between A and B on HOLD.
Now if User C sends 200 OK to User A then it implies that INVITE was
successful.

or if  User A receives a non 200 OK response then it implies that INVITE was
not successful. The depending on the
type of response , corresponding action could be taken by User A.

hello all,

could any one explain what a SIP UA has to do for a -ve response for a HOLD
and HOLD retrieve messages. And how long a UA could remain in held state.

Thanks
S.Kumar
