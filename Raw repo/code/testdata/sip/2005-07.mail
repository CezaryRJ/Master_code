Hi,=20

I fully agree with John.

The solution presented in the draft that says that if the UAC do not =
insert the location in the INVITE and if its outbound proxy has the info =
and wants to have it included it into the INVITE, it returns it in a 4xx =
"Retry Location Body" has several drawbacks :

- What if the UAC issues the new INVITE that does not contains the =
location object (because it does not support this draft for example). If =
the call does not go through, this is a very big issue when the call is =
an emergency call. As a service provider we cannot rely on the capacity =
of the UAC to allow emergency calls to go through.

- What if the UAC issues a new INVITE that contains the location object =
but that does not correspond to the one the proxy gave.

- This solution introduces a supplementary exchange between the UA and =
its proxy which introduces an additional delay to the call =
establishement (especially important if the UA is over a radio access).=20

If the draft stays as it is, this is one more reason why service =
providers would need an SBC : in order to be able to insert location =
information to an INVITE request without requiring any UA intervention.

It is necessary for a proxy to be able to insert this location info =
without having to rely on the UA's intervention.=20

Sebastien.

James, Brian,=20

In section 9 (special provisions for emergency calls) it states:=20

"In the case where the Proxy knows the location of the UAC and does not =
detect the UAC's location information message body in the message (or =
determines the LO is bad), the Proxy generates a new 4XX (Retry Location =
Body) error message that includes a location information message body =
for that UAC to include in the subsequent message.  The user agent MUST =
include this message body in the subsequent emergency message."

This places a new requirement on the UAC, which will not be met by UACs =
that are not compliant to this document. It seems emergency calls from =
such UACs will fail.

Regards,=20

I wonder if we can use a Supported:location header to distinguish the =20=

case of a UA who understands the new rules for handling location from =20=

a UA that will be confused by receiving a 4xx and abandon the call.

That task is simpler than I've made it appear, I think.  Though I wrote the
address as "a.example.com", it has to be "the address by which EP accesses
A", which is most likely expressed by an absolute IP address.  In any case,
it comes from a "Record-Route: a.example.com" that UA A adds to the
route-set, so UA A *must* know what that address is.

That is true, though the Route processing logic can be fairly simple, as it
only has to recognize and discard Route headers for the one address
"a.example.com".  (It shouldn't see any others.)

Though there is more obscure processing problem -- the request-URI will be
"GRUU-A@example.com", and the UA has to be able to recognize its own GRUUs
and not forward them to the central server for resolution.

More exactly, that is the problem I'm attempting to solve.

True, but that is the particular case I'm trying to solve.  Not so much when
EP provides some sort of AAA service, but when it sits on an
address-translation boundary and must remain in the route set because A and
HP cannot talk directly.

Well, I was thinking of how we could allow multiple contacts for a GRUU in a
manner that was as close as possible to draft-ietf-sip-gruu-03.  The draft
is keen on two points:  1) a GRUU corresponds to an instance-ID and an AOR,
and 2) a GRUU has exactly one contact.  The more I think about it, the more
I like (1) and the less I like (2).  It seems to me that contacts could be
connected to GRUUs as dynamically as they are connected to AORs.  As I said
before, that does not present the proxy with any routing problem that it
does not already know how to solve.

And now draft-jennings-sipping-outbound shows another situation where having
only one contact for a GRUU is not what we really want.

There is one question that I wanted to get an opinion on and also know
if it was ever discussed at some point (I could not get much from the
archives on this)

RFC 3265 is based on the premise of subscription state that is created
and maintained by SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY exchange and leverages on SIP Dialog
machinery for ordering etc. This translates to a Dialog state creation
and maintenance at the Subscriber and Notifier end. The question that I
have is "Was a stateless notification service considered in SIP
framework?"=20

By stateless notification I mean an entity subscribed to certain events
gets the notifications when the event is generated *without* having to
maintain any dialog state. Usually the notification will have some
semblance of versioning in the body and the consumer (subscriber) will
understand the event package and will be able to discard any
notification of a prior version (if required).=20
The motivation for this line of thought is the usage similar to
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-config-framework-
06.txt where the information to be notified to the UA is not changing
very frequently but can change anytime, so you need a constant
subscription (infinitely lived) and would end up maintaining
subscription dialogs with very little notifications on that dialog.=20

So what I am alluding to is a mechanism (in addition to RFC 3265) where
the SUBSCRIBE request behaves like a REGISTER in the sense that it
installs a subscription with the subscriber (to an abstract subscription
service) *without* creating any dialog, just like REGISTER registers an
AOR to a location service. (This subscription can also be installed by
some non-SIP means as referred to in 3265). When the event is generated
the subscription service sends a NOTIFY, again *without* creating any
dialog. This way the SIP Notification server shall not need to maintain
any state when it doesn't need to, particularly when the event stimulus
comes from outside and SIP Notification server may just send
notifications (by looking up the abstract subscription service if need
be).=20

This seems very difficult to do.  A publisher needs to keep a list of all
the subscribers to which it will send notifications.  And since the
publisher needs to be able to forget a subscription if it is not refreshed
after a while, the subscribers need to remember to refresh their
subscriptions.  Both of these require state.

The PUBLISH method avoids these problems, but in effect, by provisioning the
list of subscribers rather than constructing it dynamically.

I think we are really on the same page here.

Maybe -outbound- isn't so clear, but I believe that if both it and gruu 
are in use then it requires that gruu allow multiple contacts for the 
same instance id, which an extension to the gruu spec. Instead of 
allowing only one contact per instance id, it only allows one per each 
instanceid/flowid pair.

Were that all agreed to, you could achieve what you want by simply doing 
one registration with two contacts, which have a common instanceid but 
different flowids.

In outbound, one purpose of flowid is to distinguish intentional 
registration of another contact to the same instance id from a 
registration of a replacement contact to that instance id. This is what 
would be exploited for your case. In principle this isn't needed in the 
case of a single registration. If one register request contains two 
contacts with the same instanceid, one can presume that one is not 
intended to supercede the other without any further hints. So 
conceivably the rules could be relaxed to not requie flowid in this case.

I will second Dale. I think of REGISTER as creating a sort of "poor 
man's dialog". Were we to start over I don't think you would see 
REGISTER again in its current form, but it is grandfathered in now.

Also, the way register works is based on the assumtion that REGISTER 
messages will not be forked to different candidate registrars. If that 
did happen, then register refreshing would not work right. You can't 
make the same assumption about subscriptions, so you need to retain the 
route to the server in order to properly refresh.

I've been having other discussions with people about "implicit 
subscription" or "unsolicited notification". These are all driven by the 
same desire to get rid of some state or the messages that establish it. 
For instance lots of people want to avoid the subscription for MWI.

But as yet nobody has proposed a viable way to do it. Stuff has been 
implemented to do this, but the cases I am aware of are hacks with major 
limitations.

I don't think a solution that requires "some" dyanmic state, but less 
that a dialog, is an interesting solution.

The most interesting case where I think it might be possible to come up 
with a solution is when the notifier knows a priori that it wants to 
notify all registered contacts for its own AoR. In that case the 
notifier has statically provisioned state about its own AoR and the need 
to notify that, but no dynamic state. (The MWI is an example of this 
case.) But I haven't yet found a good solution for even this case.

I notice that Nasir specifically said "dialog state".  Perhaps he 
considers dialog state somehow different from the state needed to
maintain a subscription (expires, address, event I guess).

Though I do not have a solution, I think that this is a problem which
will become evident when more and more uses for SIP notification
mechanism come to the fore.=20
Arguably there will be cases where the use does not even warrant a SIP
Notification event package.

The vexing problem is the case where the subscriptions have an infinite
life as in a few examples below.=20

- "Send me a notification with update to my UA when my user profile
changes" (*which may happen once in months*) {SIP UA Profile framework}
- "Send me a notification when my buddy is in the vicinity of 2 miles"
(*which may not happen in days*) {Presence event package}=20
- "Send me notification when the administrator changes my registration
state. (*which may not happen that frequently*) {Registration event
package}

Etc.=20
The state that is to be notified in such cases is typically resident in
a database (or some other persistent store), this data is being modified
by different agents, so in above three examples the agents could be=20
(a) User changing his own profile going through the self admin website
(b) Presence Server
(c) Registrar Administrator
All this state has nothing to do with dialog semantics, but will result
in unending subscriptions. =20

IMHO the "poor man's dialog" is not a bad tradeoff when you have to
maintain these infinitely long subscription dialogs just because a
notification may be generated once in a while. I was trying to think of
a Subscription Server(like a Registrar) with a Subscription data store
(like an abstract location service) and taking the argument further that
Subscription having the capability of sending *out of dialog* NOTIFY
(which is not the same thing as unsolicited NOTIFY when the UA is
*expecting* such NOTIFIES).=20

Though I do not have a solution, I think that this is a problem which<br>
will become evident when more and more uses for SIP notification<br>
mechanism come to the fore. <br>
Arguably there will be cases where the use does not even warrant a SIP<br>
Notification event package.<br>
<br>
The vexing problem is the case where the subscriptions have an infinite<br>
life as in a few examples below. <br>
<br>
- &quot;Send me a notification with update to my UA when my user profile<br>
changes&quot; (*which may happen once in months*) {SIP UA Profile framework}<br>
- &quot;Send me a notification when my buddy is in the vicinity of 2 miles&quot;<br>
(*which may not happen in days*) {Presence event package} <br>
- &quot;Send me notification when the administrator changes my registration<br>
state. (*which may not happen that frequently*) {Registration event<br>
package}<br>
<br>
Etc. <br>
The state that is to be notified in such cases is typically resident in<br>
a database (or some other persistent store), this data is being modified<br>
by different agents, so in above three examples the agents could be <br>
(a) User changing his own profile going through the self admin website<br>
(b) Presence Server<br>
(c) Registrar Administrator<br>
All this state has nothing to do with dialog semantics, but will result<br>
in unending subscriptions. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
IMHO the &quot;poor man's dialog&quot; is not a bad tradeoff when you have
to<br>
maintain these infinitely long subscription dialogs just because a<br>
notification may be generated once in a while. I was trying to think of<br>
a Subscription Server(like a Registrar) with a Subscription data store<br>
(like an abstract location service) and taking the argument further that<br>
Subscription having the capability of sending *out of dialog* NOTIFY<br>
(which is not the same thing as unsolicited NOTIFY when the UA is<br>
*expecting* such NOTIFIES). <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
&gt;I will second Dale. I think of REGISTER as creating a sort of &quot;poor<br>
man's &gt;dialog&quot;. Were we to start over I don't think you would see<br>
REGISTER again &gt;in its current form, but it is grandfathered in now.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Also, the way register works is based on the assumtion that REGISTER<br>
&gt;messages will not be forked to different candidate registrars. If that<br>
did &gt;happen, then register refreshing would not work right. You can't<br>
make the &gt;same assumption about subscriptions, so you need to retain
the<br>
route to the &gt;server in order to properly refresh.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I've been having other discussions with people about &quot;implicit<br>
&gt;subscription&quot; or &quot;unsolicited notification&quot;. These are
all driven by<br>
the &gt;same desire to get rid of some state or the messages that establish<br>
it. For &gt;instance lots of people want to avoid the subscription for
MWI.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;But as yet nobody has proposed a viable way to do it. Stuff has been<br>
&gt;implemented to do this, but the cases I am aware of are hacks with<br>
major &gt;limitations.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I don't think a solution that requires &quot;some&quot; dyanmic state,
but less<br>
that &gt;a dialog, is an interesting solution.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The most interesting case where I think it might be possible to come
up<br>
&gt;with a solution is when the notifier knows a priori that it wants to<br>
notify &gt;all registered contacts for its own AoR. In that case the<br>
notifier has &gt;statically provisioned state about its own AoR and the<br>
need to notify that, &gt;but no dynamic state. (The MWI is an example of<br>
this case.) But I haven't &gt;yet found a good solution for even this case.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;By stateless notification I mean an entity subscribed to<br>
&gt;certain events<br>
&gt;gets the notifications when the event is generated *without* having
to<br>
&gt;maintain any dialog state.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;This seems very difficult to do. &nbsp;A publisher needs to keep a
list of<br>
all<br>
&gt;the subscribers to which it will send notifications. &nbsp;And since
the<br>
&gt;publisher needs to be able to forget a subscription if it is not<br>
refreshed<br>
&gt;after a while, the subscribers need to remember to refresh their<br>
&gt;subscriptions. &nbsp;Both of these require state.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The PUBLISH method avoids these problems, but in effect, by<br>
provisioning the<br>
&gt;list of subscribers rather than constructing it dynamically.<br>

Juha,

It is there for backwards compatibility with implementations that sent
it in the past.

Nasir,

There is no such thing in the real world of software as an infinite
subscription.  Sometime in the next 5, 10, or 20 years your user agent
will be unplugged, recycled, rebooted, reprogrammed, renumbered or
*something* will happen to it, and unless there is a state recovery
mechanism your notifier will leak memory like a sieve.  For most UAs
it is far more likely for the UA to change IP addresses and therefore
change its Contact address once a week or once a month.

Clearly you need to keep the target URI, an expiration time, and some
indicator of the "version" you are sending so the "subscriber" can
detect stale state.  PUBLISH uses an ETag for this and you can use the
CSeq in a SUB/NOT dialog.

The only additional piece of state left is a Call-ID and two tags
(which I only need for SUB/NOT).  I don't see any convincing analysis
that the Call-ID and tags create such a problem in a real
implementation that actually works (i.e. that is already storing an
expiration time and "version").

It is easy to remove state when you ignore the messy changes that
happen in the real world, but if things didn't change, we wouldn't
have jobs or interesting problems to work on.

thanks,
-rohan

what is for backwards compatibility?  indication of tls over tcp has
been deprecated and now people are proposing indication of tls over
sctp.  why is the latter now needed if the former is not anymore needed?
makes no sense to me.

if uri scheme is sips, then transport=tcp and transport=sctp are enough,
because sips requires tls.  on the other hand, if uri scheme is sip AND
sip entity wants to specify that tls is used anyhow, then we need some
other transport parameter to tell if tls is to be implemented over tcp or
sctp.

i suggest that draft-ietf-sip-sctp-06.txt is changed to cover BOTH tcp
and sctp case.  in case of tls/tcp, the parameter could be tls-tcp and
in case of tls/sctp, the parameter could be tls-sctp.

Rohan,

My question was motivated by practical considerations, but perhaps I
could not articulate it properly, my mistake.=20

Yes. The UA will most certainly be rebooted, lose connectivity, upgraded
etc. By "infinite subscription" I meant the service that needs the UA to
always be subscribed (so if subscription ends by any reason, it will
have to re-subscribe). The few examples I stated in previous mail using
Presence Event package, Registration event package and SIP UA Profile
package need the UA to be constantly subscribed for those events.
(again, if subscription ends then refresh it etc.). =20

I may be venturing into implementation details here (which may vary) but
I presume that most of the implementations consider dialogs to be
"active" objects and hence memory-resident for most part.=20
So considering the fact that the subscriptions in examples above last as
long as the user is availing the service from the service provider and
there is very little notification traffic and that too triggered by
external stimulus in most part, I was suggesting to think about means
for dialog-less notifications, thus allowing for simpler
implementations.=20

Thanks

Nasir Khan
BEA Systems, Inc.

It is easy to remove state when you ignore the messy changes that

My question was motivated by practical considerations, but perhaps I<br>
could not articulate it properly, my mistake. <br>
<br>
Yes. The UA will most certainly be rebooted, lose connectivity, upgraded<br>
etc. By &quot;infinite subscription&quot; I meant the service that needs
the UA to<br>
always be subscribed (so if subscription ends by any reason, it will<br>
have to re-subscribe). The few examples I stated in previous mail using<br>
Presence Event package, Registration event package and SIP UA Profile<br>
package need the UA to be constantly subscribed for those events.<br>
(again, if subscription ends then refresh it etc.). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
I may be venturing into implementation details here (which may vary) but<br>
I presume that most of the implementations consider dialogs to be<br>
&quot;active&quot; objects and hence memory-resident for most part. <br>
So considering the fact that the subscriptions in examples above last as<br>
long as the user is availing the service from the service provider and<br>
there is very little notification traffic and that too triggered by<br>
external stimulus in most part, I was suggesting to think about means<br>
for dialog-less notifications, thus allowing for simpler<br>
implementations. <br>
<br>

<br>
There is no such thing in the real world of software as an infinite<br>
subscription. &nbsp;Sometime in the next 5, 10, or 20 years your user agent<br>
will be unplugged, recycled, rebooted, reprogrammed, renumbered or<br>
*something* will happen to it, and unless there is a state recovery<br>
mechanism your notifier will leak memory like a sieve. &nbsp;For most UAs<br>
it is far more likely for the UA to change IP addresses and therefore<br>
change its Contact address once a week or once a month.<br>
<br>
Clearly you need to keep the target URI, an expiration time, and some<br>
indicator of the &quot;version&quot; you are sending so the &quot;subscriber&quot;
can<br>
detect stale state. &nbsp;PUBLISH uses an ETag for this and you can use
the<br>
CSeq in a SUB/NOT dialog.<br>
<br>
The only additional piece of state left is a Call-ID and two tags<br>
(which I only need for SUB/NOT). &nbsp;I don't see any convincing analysis<br>
that the Call-ID and tags create such a problem in a real<br>
implementation that actually works (i.e. that is already storing an<br>
expiration time and &quot;version&quot;).<br>
<br>
It is easy to remove state when you ignore the messy changes that<br>
happen in the real world, but if things didn't change, we wouldn't<br>
have jobs or interesting problems to work on.<br>
<br>

&gt; Though I do not have a solution, I think that this is a problem which<br>
&gt; will become evident when more and more uses for SIP notification<br>
&gt; mechanism come to the fore.<br>
&gt; Arguably there will be cases where the use does not even warrant a
SIP<br>
&gt; Notification event package.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The vexing problem is the case where the subscriptions have an<br>
infinite<br>
&gt; life as in a few examples below.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - &quot;Send me a notification with update to my UA when my user profile<br>
&gt; changes&quot; (*which may happen once in months*) {SIP UA Profile<br>
framework}<br>
&gt; - &quot;Send me a notification when my buddy is in the vicinity of
2 miles&quot;<br>
&gt; (*which may not happen in days*) {Presence event package}<br>
&gt; - &quot;Send me notification when the administrator changes my registration<br>
&gt; state. (*which may not happen that frequently*) {Registration event<br>
&gt; package}<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Etc.<br>
&gt; The state that is to be notified in such cases is typically resident<br>
in<br>
&gt; a database (or some other persistent store), this data is being<br>
modified<br>
&gt; by different agents, so in above three examples the agents could be<br>
&gt; (a) User changing his own profile going through the self admin website<br>
&gt; (b) Presence Server<br>
&gt; (c) Registrar Administrator<br>
&gt; All this state has nothing to do with dialog semantics, but will<br>
result<br>
&gt; in unending subscriptions.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; IMHO the &quot;poor man's dialog&quot; is not a bad tradeoff when
you have to<br>
&gt; maintain these infinitely long subscription dialogs just because a<br>
&gt; notification may be generated once in a while. I was trying to think<br>
of<br>
&gt; a Subscription Server(like a Registrar) with a Subscription data store<br>
&gt; (like an abstract location service) and taking the argument further<br>
that<br>
&gt; Subscription having the capability of sending *out of dialog* NOTIFY<br>
&gt; (which is not the same thing as unsolicited NOTIFY when the UA is<br>
&gt; *expecting* such NOTIFIES).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks<br>
&gt; Nasir Khan<br>
&gt; BEA Systems, Inc.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt;I will second Dale. I think of REGISTER as creating a sort of
&quot;poor<br>
&gt; man's &gt;dialog&quot;. Were we to start over I don't think you would
see<br>
&gt; REGISTER again &gt;in its current form, but it is grandfathered in
now.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;Also, the way register works is based on the assumtion that REGISTER<br>
&gt; &gt;messages will not be forked to different candidate registrars.
If<br>
that<br>
&gt; did &gt;happen, then register refreshing would not work right. You
can't<br>
&gt; make the &gt;same assumption about subscriptions, so you need to retain<br>
the<br>
&gt; route to the &gt;server in order to properly refresh.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;I've been having other discussions with people about &quot;implicit<br>
&gt; &gt;subscription&quot; or &quot;unsolicited notification&quot;. These
are all driven by<br>
&gt; the &gt;same desire to get rid of some state or the messages that<br>
establish<br>
&gt; it. For &gt;instance lots of people want to avoid the subscription
for<br>
MWI.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;But as yet nobody has proposed a viable way to do it. Stuff has
been<br>
&gt; &gt;implemented to do this, but the cases I am aware of are hacks
with<br>
&gt; major &gt;limitations.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;I don't think a solution that requires &quot;some&quot; dyanmic
state, but less<br>
&gt; that &gt;a dialog, is an interesting solution.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;The most interesting case where I think it might be possible to
come<br>
up<br>
&gt; &gt;with a solution is when the notifier knows a priori that it wants
to<br>
&gt; notify &gt;all registered contacts for its own AoR. In that case the<br>
&gt; notifier has &gt;statically provisioned state about its own AoR and
the<br>
&gt; need to notify that, &gt;but no dynamic state. (The MWI is an example
of<br>
&gt; this case.) But I haven't &gt;yet found a good solution for even this<br>
case.<br>

&gt; &gt;By stateless notification I mean an entity subscribed to<br>
&gt; &gt;certain events<br>
&gt; &gt;gets the notifications when the event is generated *without* having<br>
to<br>
&gt; &gt;maintain any dialog state.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;This seems very difficult to do. &nbsp;A publisher needs to keep
a list of<br>
&gt; all<br>
&gt; &gt;the subscribers to which it will send notifications. &nbsp;And
since the<br>
&gt; &gt;publisher needs to be able to forget a subscription if it is not<br>
&gt; refreshed<br>
&gt; &gt;after a while, the subscribers need to remember to refresh their<br>
&gt; &gt;subscriptions. &nbsp;Both of these require state.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;The PUBLISH method avoids these problems, but in effect, by<br>
&gt; provisioning the<br>
&gt; &gt;list of subscribers rather than constructing it dynamically.<br>

ACK for a 2xx creates a new transaction(special tramsaction, which doesnt
have any response), but for non2xx responses its part of INVITE transaction.

Actually, what makes these cases vexing is the extremely low rate at which
notifications will be sent.  One might expect that one could just do a
SUBSCRIBE with a very long expires time, but since NOTIFYs are sent within
the dialog established by SUBSCRIBE, when the UA changes its contact
address, the SUBSCRIBE has to be refreshed.  Hence there is more traffic
maintaining the subscriptions than doing notifications.

So we can characterize the problem as "notifications that are less frequent
than the UA changes its contact address".

Within this context, it seems like PUBLISH messages would be an acceptable
way to deliver the notification.  PUBLISH can be sent to the user's AOR, and
SIP will route the update to the current UA.  (A UA may also have to request
an explicit update when it starts up.)

But how to maintain the state that user foo@bar wants notification of X?  In
practice this is often done by provisioning (foo goes to a web page to
update his list of notifications), because the overhead cost of having an
obsolete notification request in the database is small.  But we might want
to use some variant of SUBSCRIBE to maintain notifications.

As I see it, the concept that there should only be one contact for a given
GRUU is of little value.  At worst, it means that a request to the GRUU
forks, but then both sides of the fork (if they both get through) go to the
same device, which can select which of them it wishes to answer.  And in
general, if one contact is to supercede another, the UA should be cancelling
the registration for the old contact, which will automatically remove it as
a contact for the GRUU.

I think it has been recognized that there indeed can be multiple 
contacts for a GRUU. But this is semantically different from different 
contacts for an AoR. With an AoR the assumption is that the different 
contacts represent distinct alternative UAs. With a GRUU the assumption 
is that the GRUU represents a single UA and that multiple contacts 
represent different ways of reaching it.

The rest of the stuff around this is a matter of how to manage all this 
in some kind of coherent way, and preserve the above semantics. And so 
far the attempt has been to manage this using just the REGISTER request. 
(An unexplored alternative would be to use different requests to manage 
these two concepts.)

I believe the assumption has been that because these are alternative 
paths to the same destination, that they should be tried serially, and a 
subsequent one only tried if the first one failed in a way that is 
consistent with loss of connectivity.

I suppose one could argue with that philosopy.

In general that would be the goal. But failure scenarios may result in 
that not happening. E.g. a device reboots and gets a different ip 
address assigned to it. It doesn't remember the one it had before reboot.

I got one question of INFO method usage for ISUP to SIP IW.=20

Per RFC 2976 said INFO is used to convey the mid-call information =
between 2 UA without impacting the existing call state, which may be =
used for ISUP to SIP IW. =20

My question is can INFO method be sent before the dialog has been =
established, or it is only allowed to be sent after a confirmed dialog. =
Because some ISUP message such as INR/INF, will be sent before ACM/ANM, =
which maps to SIP will establish the confirmed dialog.

Thanks,

INFO can be sent after early-dialog is established. 
So that INR/INF should be encapsulated in INFO after early dialog.

Hi,

If I remember correctly, INFO follows the rules of BYE. And, a BYE =
cannot be sent in the backword direction for an early dialog, I think.

So, I believe that Q.1912.5 uses 18x responses for ISUP sent backward =
during early dialogs.

I hope you just mean that Q.1912.5 may provide additional guidance on =
how it is interworked.

Q.1912.5 cannot change the INFO method and when it is used as the SIP =
changes RFC precludes that, and in any case, Q.1912.5 is only an =
interworking specification, and interworking specifications cannot =
rewrite the base protocol.

The text of RFC 2976 is rather ambiguous on this point.  It says that
various headers are to be handled "as defined for the BYE request" (section
2.4), but it doesn't say that *when it can be sent* is as for the BYE
request.  It does envision that INFO requests can be forked (section 4),
which can only happen if an INFO is sent not only in an early dialog, but
before a 1xx response has established a to-tag.  (A request with a to-tag is
within an established route set and can't fork.)

My guess is that INFO can be sent at any time (and proxies should handle it
correctly), but if it is sent before a dialog has been confirmed, due
consideration should be given toward ensuring that it will be routed to the
destination(s) you intend and interpreted correctly by them.  A lot of this
probably depends on the details of your particular use of INFO, which may be
different from other uses of INFO.

Dale

RFC 2976 says that the INFO follows the rules for BYE as contained in RFC 
2543, which is now obsolete, so where does that leave us? RFC 2543 didn't mention 
"early dialog". Can anyone say that RFC 3261 is exactly the same in this 
area?

We've already seen at least three different opinions on this question.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Conveying Feature Tags with Session Initiation Protocol REFER Method
	Author(s)	: O. Levin, A. Johnston
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-refer-feature-param-00.txt
	Pages		: 6
	Date		: 2005-7-6
	
   This document extends the SIP REFER method, defined in RFC 3515, to
   convey feature parameters defined in RFC 3840.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-feature-param-00.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.  
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.


Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-refer-feature-param-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-feature-param-00.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hi,

Now there are 2 questions: 

(1) When can INFO be sent? Can it be sent from callee to caller?

At the time when RFC2976 is created, "early dialog" is not introduces.
Although RFC2976 said that it follows the rules for BYE. 
I guess the indended meaning is that it should follow the rules for messages
inside dialog such as BYE.
Since it can be used to carry end-to-end information(sometimes before dialog
is confirmed like UPDATE), there is no reason to prohibit it from being sent
by callee within dialog.

Where it can be sent before early dialog is an interesting question, It may
depend on the intent of the message. 
Considering the forking issure, if it carries the information which must be
sent to the designated recipient, it`s better to send in within a dialog.

In this case, my personal opinion is that early dialog should be established
as early as possible to make UPDATE or INFO possible to be delivered. 
even there is no explicit progress indicator for ringing  or queing etc.

(2) for ISUP interworking where to encapsulate backword ISUP message like
INR? INFO or reliable 1xx?

If we agree that INFO can be sent in both direction. It may be sent either
in reliable 1xx or INFO. 

RFC3398 section 13.1 have some rule: 
"From the caller to the callee, other ISUP messages SHOULD be
   encapsulated (see [3]) inside INFO messages, even if the INVITE
   transaction is still not finished. "

"From the callee to the caller, if a message is received by a gateway
   before the call has been answered (i.e., ANM is received) it SHOULD
   be encapsulated in an INFO, provided that this will not be the first
   SIP message sent in the backwards direction (in which case it SHOULD
   be encapsulated in a provisional 1xx response). Similarly a message
   which is received on the originating side (probably in response to an
   INR) before a 200 OK has been received by the gateway should be
   carried within an INFO.  "

RFC 2976 says that the INFO follows the rules for BYE as contained in RFC
2543, which is now obsolete, so where does that leave us? RFC 2543 didn't
mention "early dialog". Can anyone say that RFC 3261 is exactly the same in
this area?

We've already seen at least three different opinions on this question.

Actually, thats not right - it can know. It depends on the gruu 
construction algorithm. This actually relates to an open issue I raised 
at the last IETF - how the proxy knows to send a 404 vs. a 480.

Here is the full text of the first two paragraphs of this section:

8.4.1  Request Targeting

    When a proxy server receives a request, and the proxy owns the domain
    in the Request URI, and the proxy is supposed to access a Location
    Service in order to compute request targets (as specified in Section
    16.5 of RFC 3261 [1]), the proxy MUST check if the Request URI is a
    GRUU created by that domain.

    If the GRUU does not exist within the domain, the proxy MUST generate
    a 404 (Not Found) response to the request.


I'd suggest adding the following sentence to the end of the first paragraph:

"If the Request-URI is not within the domain of the proxy, the proxy 
follows the procedures in RFC 3261 and rejects the request. If the 
Request URI is within the domain of the proxy, and the proxy knows of 
the resource, but it is not a GRUU, processing is outside of the scope 
of this specification. If the request URI is within the domain of the 
proxy, and the URI has been constructed by the domain such that the 
proxy is able to determine that it has the form of a GRUU for an AOR 
that is unknown within the domain, the proxy rejects the request with a 
404. If the request URI is within the domain of the proxy, and the URI 
has been constructed by the domain such that the proxy is able to 
determine that it has the form of a GRUU for an AOR that known within 
the domain, but the instance ID is unknown, the proxy SHOULD generate a 
480."


This makes things much more specific, and also provides an algorithm for 
sending a 404 vs. a 480 that is readily realizable.

There is a lot of value when the client is not trying to have redundant 
paths to reach the same instance, which is the only case when you really 
want multiple contacts for the same gruu. For this reason, the 
multiple-contacts thing is being handled in the sipping-outbound draft.

Now, the problem is, as you point out, that draft-ietf-sip-gruu is 
fairly dogmatic about a single contact per gruu, when we know we are 
about to modify that behavior in the sipping-outbound draft. One of the 
changes I am making in the next revision of gruu is to add some weasel 
words that open the door for a future spec to define a case where 
multiple contacts would be permitted.

That was the initial design. The problem it had was a terrible 
amplification of avalanche restart load. If a bunch of clients restart 
due to a restoration of power after an outage, you have at least a 
doubleing of the number of registration transactions that need to be 
processed. In the initial design, where the registrar prohibited 
multiple registered contacts with the same instance ID, it took four 
transactions:

1. initial registration that fails
2. query registration to learn existing contacts
3. registration to remove the exsiting contact
4. registration to add the new one

if you allow multiple contacts with the same instance ID to register, 
you can reduce that to two:

1. initial registration, response indicates multiple contacts with the 
same instance ID
2. second registration to remove the old one


The avalanche restart was considered sufficiently nasty that it was 
worthwhile to have this enforcement about a single contact for a 
particular instance ID, which we'll relax somewhat with 
sipping-outbound, but all that does is add an additional parameter to 
the uniqueness key - the flow ID. Same basic idea though - you can only 
have one contact for a specific flowID/instanceID, and if you register a 
second one it actually clobbers the first. That behavior gets you the 
benefits of multiple contacts without the avalanche restart consequences.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Dale,

Firstly, thanks for these most excellent and thoughtful comments. I'm 
going to respond to each party separately.

I agree with Paul here that this seems of limited applicability. It 
would represent an additional feature of gruu, and as such I'd rather 
leave it out of scope. There are numerous ways to do this downstream if 
we should so desire. I'd suggest you write up an I-D on the specific 
motivations if you'd like to pursue it.

Thanks,

The definitions are all lifted from RFC2533.

The presence of the <>s has been a source of confusion in the gruu spec. 
They do need to be there. I've clarified the text in the spec to make it 
clear that this is the case.

Hi,

Yes. Q.1912.5 says that certain ISUP messages, in certain situations, =
are encapsulated and carried in SIP 18x responses.

>Q.1912.5 cannot change the INFO method and when it is used as=20
>the SIP changes RFC precludes that, and in any case, Q.1912.5=20

I don't think the Q.1912.5 changes the INFO method. The reason Q.1912.5 =
says how ISUP messages are interworked, and in the case of SIP-I also =
carried, in SIP messages. And, all that is of course based on what is =
allowed from a SIP perspective.

Hi,

No matter if, at the end of the day, it is allowed to send INFO backward =
in an early dialog or not, Q.1912.5 currently says that 18x is used to =
carry most ISUP messages in the backward direction during early dialogs. =


Someone also mentioned forking. If you have SIP-I with forking there are =
a number of of other issues to think about, so "INFO vs 18x" is probably =
going to be the least of your problems :)

This is something I have considered off and on, not so much in the 
context of gruu, but for SIP processing in general, and that is whether 
or not the registered contact ought to have been populated by the proxy 
into a route rather than into the request URI, in which case the request 
URI would be the original AOR. A bunch of problems get solved if you do 
this. For example, the problem that motivated the development of 
P-Called-Party-ID in RFC 3455.

As such, there is at the core here a fairly fundamental change to 
route/contact processing, and using gruu as a vehicle for introducing it.

The main issue I ran into with this was the notion of domain ownership; 
it implied that mid-dialog requests would have a request URI that 
identified a target resource that is really owned by a proxy in the 
domain, yet the request is routed to, and terminates at, a UA that can 
really only claim ownership over its own IP address. This may seem like 
a theoretical problem, but it manifests itself in some of the real 
issues raised by Nils around invocation of services.

Another issue is the one raised by Nils:

Nils Ohlmeier wrote:
> My concerns with such a solution are:

This is indeed a big problem. The solution proposed for this is in the 
sipping-outbound draft, which basically allows the gruu to get bound to 
a connection to the EP rather than to the IP address and port of the UA. 
This means that, in order to be reachable by the proxy, the address the 
proxy uses needs to be the gruu, and that leads us right back to square one.

I suppose a fix for this is this. When the sipping-outbound mechanism is 
in use, a proxy will insert a Path header field value into the REGISTER 
that identifies the "connection" that the client registered through. 
This URI is used by the proxy for incoming requests to route them 
towards that client, more or less ignoring the request URI. Note that 
the Path values are returned to the client in the 200 OK to register. 
So, the client could use that Path value in its record-route value. That 
would solve the nat problem at least.

However, one of the benefits that gruu brings to the table is that it 
adds a layer of indirection for mid-dialog request routing. If you have 
a session in progress and you end up re-registering, possibly to a 
different proxy, mid-dialog requests can still be delivered to you. This 
need arises for some of the mobility use cases, and for various failure 
cases where the client loses its connection to the server. If we put a 
client IP address or a connection URI (as learned from Path) into the 
record-route, we pin the mid-dialog requests to that specific IP address 
or connection, eliminating these benefits.

That said, your suggestion is a simple way to solve an otherwise nasty 
problem. Indeed, you are absolutely correct that the gruu has really a 
split personality; its being used as a way to reach a specific UA 
instance for a mid-dialog request, but also as a way to reach a UA 
instance outside of a dialog. There are, unfortunately, differences in 
the types of features that a proxy might want to invoke on the request 
depending on whether its mid-dialog or an initial request, and that is a 
consequence of this split personality you point to.

The net/net for me is that I think my original proposal, of just 
allowing the proxy to remove its record-route header field in the 200 
OK, is really the simplest. There are a few ways the proxy can determine 
that it is safe to remove the record-route.

Hi,

Also, if I remember correctly, this was in fact discussed on the =
SIP/SIPPING list at the time when we were working on Q.1912.5., so I =
assume that our understanding of the usage of INFO was verified at that =
time.

I'd like to counter-propose a "subscription aggregator" -- that is, 
allow a single SUBSCRIBE request to establish a dialog upon which 
notifications for multiple event
sources might occur.

One might then define a metapackage that includes, for example, 
subscription to reg-event, mwi, config, presence resource-list, and all 
the other things that a UA might subscribe to on startup.

Jonathan has proposed making REGISTER create a dialog for the servicing 
of subscriptions. I think an aggregator would be much cleaner.

Now, as o how it might work -- the set of subscriptions to be aggregated 
should be defined dynamically. One idea would be to use the body of the 
SUBSCRIBE request to contain a URI list, with each such URI representing 
a resource to be SUBSCRIBEd to. This approach is consistent with the URI 
list work:
see 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-subscribe-03.txt

Another approach would be to use a server-contained list that would be 
modified using XCAP. This is closer to the orignal resource-list work.

I agree this is a major deficiency in the SIP events framework. It is 
partly due to the fact that the SUBSCRIBE method is overloaded to do 
initial subscriptions, refreshes, as well as fetches within dialogs. 
Therefore, the notifier will always generate a NOTIFY upon receiving a 
SUBSCRIBE, even though the subscriber may already have that state and 
thus doesn't actually need it.

I think there is a way to solve this, and I'm working on an I-D to lay 
out the problem and start the discussion on possible solutions. 
Hopefully will have it ready before Monday. ;)

I don't see much benefit in this. Simply changing the method from a 
dialog creating one to a non-dialog-creating one doesn't solve the 
actual problem of being able to maintain subscriptions with little (or 
no) overhead.

Right.

More exactly, SUBSCRIBE is optimized for the situation where subscriptions
are relatively short lived, and the state they receive changes quite
frequently.  The "dialog state" event package is the sort of thing SUBSCRIBE
works well for.

In terms of message traffic, replacing SUBSCRIBE with PUBLISH helps a great
deal.  Because SUBSCRIBE maintains a dialog, every time the UA's address
changes, it has to refresh the subscription.  With PUBLISH, those overhead
messages are eliminated, at the cost of increased routing effort for every
notification.

In the end, there's no way to maintain a subscription without maintaining a
record that the subscription exists.  The protocol question is how to
minimize the number of overhead messages.

Q.1912.5 doesn't say much about INFO at all. The only reference is explaining 
how "transparent" messages how encapsulated, and it says they are carried in 
the following:

a)  183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the I-IWU in 
the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.

Yes, this is true for all extensions

Emergency calls only route to the appropriate PSAP based on the location of 
the caller. This will not change. SIP has no concept of physical location. 
If my current UA dials tel:911, where will the INVITE go to? 911 is good 
here in Dallas, Texas - just as it is good in New York City. There is no 
area code (ever) indicating where a 911 call is from or to. So how does the 
Proxy receiving this 911 as a Request-URI know how to route the message? 
The answer is in multiple steps:

The INVITE first has to be identified as an emergency call - a Request-URI 
911 will do this inside the US (112 works inside Europe), or Henning's 
proposed "sos@..." will do this in the future as it progresses.

The second piece to this puzzle is providing the location of the UAC. This 
serves 2 purposes:

1) it provides the location of the UAC to now look for the appropriate PSAP 
in that geographic area (the ECRIT WG is working on defining that mapping 
protocol/means of a UAC's location to the appropriate PSAP Request-URI), and

2) Providing the lcoation in the INVITE to the PSAP will give the PSAP 
operator a location to dispatch first responders to.

Without location in the INVITE, how are either of these functions accomplished?

SIP currently cannot do either without an extension to the protocol.

While adding a certain message body type isn't technically an extension, it 
is a change in behavior of a UAC and a Proxy/intermediary (to look for the 
location message body).

Given the existing SIP rules stating message bodies cannot be added to a 
SIP message by a SIP Proxy Server, we're limited with what we can do.

If the Proxy knows the location of the UAC, it has to have a means of 
informing the UAC of this location. There are several ways to do this - the 
one chosen here is a new 425 Response code (which is an extension to SIP) 
that includes a message body of the UAC's location to be used in the 
subsequent INVITE by the UAC. The user will not know of this initial 
rejection, and the UAC will need to know to send a new INVITE with this 
message body included.

I could have put in a 3XX Response to do this, but chose not to.

I don't understand Dave Oran's comment about adding a Supported header 
(Location) since this document doesn't allow a by-reference header.

Does this answer your question?

I hope I just answered his concerns with the limitations of the existing=20
SIP architecture and emergency calling in the message I just sent to the=20
list. Let me address your questions directly here

I'll turn this one around on you: What if the only INVITE were received by=
=20
the outbound proxy with no location included... where would that Proxy=20
route the message to?

Because there is no realm or domain part of a emergency call today, there=20
is no place for SIP servers to look up where the UAC is or the destination=
=20
UAS is to route the message to. The message will not go anywhere today. So=
=20
we need an extension to SIP to accomplish this.

This document is to address what needs to be done in SIP to convey=20
location. The ECRIT WG is chartered with how to take a well formed SIP=20
message (with location) and route it towards the appropriate PSAP.

>(because it does not support this draft for example). If the call does not=
=20
>go through, this is a very big issue when the call is an emergency call.

I fully agree - yet I do not see another way of solving this issue other=20
than to have location in the INVITE. Let me explain this:

If you want location to be in a header, the UAC doesn't have that=20
information unless it's told that information - or - the SIP proxy server=20
inserts this header in the INVITE message once it determines it is an=20
emergency call. This means the SIP Proxy always has to know where the UAC=20
is. That sounds like the SP is tracking the UAC. That enables tracking of=20
users through their UAs.

Doesn't this have some privacy concerns?

Do you want to be tracked everywhere you go for the one or two times in=20
your life you call 911 or 112?

Further, what if I merely want to send my location to you in an IM. Do I=20
have to rely on a tracking SP to insert it into my MESSAGE Request message=
=20
towards you in order for you to receive it from me?

What if I use two different SPs: one for Voice and one for IM. Now I have=20
to have two SPs tracking me all the time because IM will be just as easy to=
=20
use in the near future for emergency services as voice calling 911/112 is=20
today. Where does this additive SPs stop? How many SPs need to be able to=20
track me (through my UAC) to provide location conveyance services? This is=
=20
every minute of every day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, on every UAC you=
=20
and I own.

>As a service provider we cannot rely on the capacity of the UAC to allow=20
>emergency calls to go through.

What if your UAC's have a GPS? Is this not the best means of determining=20
location of the UAC? Is this going to be forbidden? If it is not, then we=20
have to have a consistent means for allowing a GPS assisted UAC to convey=20
its location for whatever purpose, even emergencies.

I believe you have a trust issue with the system. That's a separate issue -=
=20
and a lot of folks have that belief. If the designed system isn't good=20
enough, design a better system.


>- What if the UAC issues a new INVITE that contains the location object=20
>but that does not correspond to the one the proxy gave.

Then that is not a well behaving UAC. Folks that call for emergency want to=
=20
get help. If their UAC fails on them, it fails. What if I have an emergency=
=20
today and my existing GSM phone fails for whatever reason? It also fails.=20
I'm in just as much trouble. We need to build the best products for each=20
situation, but the IETF isn't defining products themselves, it's defining=20
protocols and triggers within protocols to provide features/functions.


>- This solution introduces a supplementary exchange between the UA and its=
=20
>proxy which introduces an additional delay to the call establishement=20
>(especially important if the UA is over a radio access).

how much more delay do you expect this single exchange to cause? It's one=20
round trip between one application layer hop - it's not that much time.=20
But, do you have a figure in mind that makes this undesireable?


>If the draft stays as it is, this is one more reason why service providers=
=20
>would need an SBC

and this isn't going to inject any delays? huh?

>  : in order to be able to insert location information to an INVITE=20
> request without requiring any UA intervention.

this will require the SBC to be completely stateful as to where EVERY UAC=20
is at all times just in case a UAC calls for an emergency. That means every=
=20
second of every day for the life of that UAC, and every other UAC within=20
that realm. Do you believe that will scale?

Do you believe that will not cause delay in the look-up of where a=20
particular UAC is in a location database?

Does the SBC have this database local for all UACs that it could receive a=
=20
911/112 INVITE from, or is this datebase more centralized within the SP=
 realm?

How many SBCs are you expecting per realm?

How current is the database of UAC locations among all SBCs?

I'm having a hard time believing an SBC inserting location into the INVITE=
=20
will increase efficiency. I think getting location down into the UAC is the=
=20
most efficient means of location conveyance - especially for emergency=
 calling.

Why is it necessary?

         Hi, 

 

                This is my understanding of Q.1912.5 principle : 

 

                 Q.1912.5 will not re-define the general principle of when
INFO can be sent. This should be under the IETF SIP umbrella. 

                 As our discussion these days, INFO should be sent in both
direction after dialog(including early and confirm state ) is established.

                 Q.1912.5 does have rule on how, when and where to
encapsulate ISUP message under the SIP principle.

                 Q.1912.5 just recommend that It is better to facilitate 18x
to encapsulate backward ISUP messages before dialog is confirmed.   

                 All other case may include  (1) forward ISUP messages
before dialog is confirmed  ,(2) other forward or backward messages after
dialog is confirmed.

 

                 Just as chister mentioned: the final issue may go to
whether to encapsulate backword ISUP message befor dialog is confirmed in
1xx or INFO. 

 

                 For those messages with match meaning (180-ACM/CPG,
183-ACM/CPG) , the rule is clearly defined in Q.1912.5. 

                 For those ISUP message just need transparently sent and
without meaning-matching messages in SIP like INF/INR. 

                 18x and INFO may both suitable.  From the implementation
point of view, it`s better for SIP-ISUP IWU to support both.

 

          Best reguards!

 

          Peili Xu

Yes. Q.1912.5 says that certain ISUP messages, in certain situations, are
encapsulated and carried in SIP 18x responses.



Q.1912.5 doesn't say much about INFO at all. The only reference is
explaining how "transparent" messages how encapsulated, and it says they are
carried in the following:

a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the I-IWU in
the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.
b) INFO message in all other cases. 

This means that INFO is only used after a confirmed dialog, not before, at
least in the backward direction. Q.1912.5 doesn't really describe the use of
INFO in the forward direction, but it must be allowed, since it lists ISUP
messages like Facility Request and User-to-User Information that can go in
that direction.

James,

(Replying also to your message to Sebastien)
I agree that in many environments the UAC will be the best or only place to
supply location information, in which case obviously one will need a UA
enhanced with the ability to provide location information when making an
emergency call.

However, there will be some environments (notably enterprise environments)
where the proxy has knowledge of UA location. Sending back a 4xx will work
fine if the UA supports this. However, the ability for the proxy to add
location information (in a header) when forwarding the request would be
useful in order to support existing UAs that do not have this enhancement.

John

James,

Fist, s=E9bastien wasn't arguing against the need for an extension in =
the INVITE, we fully support this. The problem is that network operators =
have one very important goal:

- the need to support a large range of terminals, not only complex ones =
and this requirement is even stronger when dealing with emergency calls. =


The solution proposed here might have some benefits for certain =
situations, but it would be a pity not to come up with a solution that =
doesnot require any specific terminal functionnality and would most =
likely cause non-standardized solution to be used.

S=E9bastien G.

I hope I just answered his concerns with the limitations of the existing =

I'll turn this one around on you: What if the only INVITE were received =
by the outbound proxy with no location included... where would that =
Proxy route the message to?

Because there is no realm or domain part of a emergency call today, =
there is no place for SIP servers to look up where the UAC is or the =
destination UAS is to route the message to. The message will not go =
anywhere today. So we need an extension to SIP to accomplish this.

This document is to address what needs to be done in SIP to convey =
location. The ECRIT WG is chartered with how to take a well formed SIP =
message (with location) and route it towards the appropriate PSAP.

>(because it does not support this draft for example). If the call does=20
>not go through, this is a very big issue when the call is an emergency =
call.

I fully agree - yet I do not see another way of solving this issue other =
than to have location in the INVITE. Let me explain this:

If you want location to be in a header, the UAC doesn't have that =
information unless it's told that information - or - the SIP proxy =
server inserts this header in the INVITE message once it determines it =
is an emergency call. This means the SIP Proxy always has to know where =
the UAC is. That sounds like the SP is tracking the UAC. That enables =
tracking of users through their UAs.

Doesn't this have some privacy concerns?

Do you want to be tracked everywhere you go for the one or two times in =
your life you call 911 or 112?

Further, what if I merely want to send my location to you in an IM. Do I =
have to rely on a tracking SP to insert it into my MESSAGE Request =
message towards you in order for you to receive it from me?

What if I use two different SPs: one for Voice and one for IM. Now I =
have to have two SPs tracking me all the time because IM will be just as =
easy to use in the near future for emergency services as voice calling =
911/112 is today. Where does this additive SPs stop? How many SPs need =
to be able to track me (through my UAC) to provide location conveyance =
services? This is every minute of every day, 7 days a week, 365 days a =
year, on every UAC you and I own.

>As a service provider we cannot rely on the capacity of the UAC to=20
>allow emergency calls to go through.

What if your UAC's have a GPS? Is this not the best means of determining =
location of the UAC? Is this going to be forbidden? If it is not, then =
we have to have a consistent means for allowing a GPS assisted UAC to =
convey its location for whatever purpose, even emergencies.

I believe you have a trust issue with the system. That's a separate =
issue - and a lot of folks have that belief. If the designed system =
isn't good enough, design a better system.


>- What if the UAC issues a new INVITE that contains the location object =

>but that does not correspond to the one the proxy gave.

Then that is not a well behaving UAC. Folks that call for emergency want =
to get help. If their UAC fails on them, it fails. What if I have an =
emergency today and my existing GSM phone fails for whatever reason? It =
also fails.=20
I'm in just as much trouble. We need to build the best products for each =
situation, but the IETF isn't defining products themselves, it's =
defining protocols and triggers within protocols to provide =
features/functions.

how much more delay do you expect this single exchange to cause? It's =
one round trip between one application layer hop - it's not that much =
time.=20
But, do you have a figure in mind that makes this undesireable?


>If the draft stays as it is, this is one more reason why service =

and this isn't going to inject any delays? huh?

this will require the SBC to be completely stateful as to where EVERY =
UAC=20
is at all times just in case a UAC calls for an emergency. That means =
every=20
second of every day for the life of that UAC, and every other UAC within =

that realm. Do you believe that will scale?

Do you believe that will not cause delay in the look-up of where a=20
particular UAC is in a location database?

Does the SBC have this database local for all UACs that it could receive =
a=20
911/112 INVITE from, or is this datebase more centralized within the SP =
realm?

How many SBCs are you expecting per realm?

How current is the database of UAC locations among all SBCs?

I'm having a hard time believing an SBC inserting location into the =
INVITE=20
will increase efficiency. I think getting location down into the UAC is =
the=20
most efficient means of location conveyance - especially for emergency =
calling.

Ok, but can you solve this in a header:

- the Geopriv WG was chartered with mandating security and privacy of a 
endsystem's location information (RFC3963) - based on the rules established 
by a "rulemaker" (which can be the enduser, the domain administrator or the 
combination), and I do not know how this can be accomplished if location is 
shown in a header inserted without the user's knowledge or control.

SIP message headers are TLS or IPsec hop-by-hop encrypted at best (right?), 
and may not be encrypted at all even one hop away from the UAC, so how is 
the user's privacy concerns about their location information not being 
divulged addressed?

This is accomplished if location were placed in a message body - which 
cannot be added in transit by a Proxy. This draft provides a means for a 
Proxy to say "hey, you need a location body in that message, here, use 
<this one> in your subsequent message". This is the 425 (Retry Location 
Body) Response I have in the doc.

To give some history, I orignially had location in a new header, but was 
told it had to be moved to the body by the WG, the chairs and the ADs (at 
Vienna). This was based on Geopriv guidelines.

So, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you that there may be cases in a 
header is better than in a body, but I don't know how to *not* violate the 
specifics or spirit of what Geopriv is doing. RFC3963 is pretty clear that 
privacy concerns need to always be taken into account when identity is 
conveyed.

Any suggestions?

Whether this is useful depends on your goals. THis is a little like an 
RLS on steroids. Like an RLS, it does not in general reduce the total 
amount of work done in the system as a whole - instead it moves the 
place where some of the work is done and also somewhat increases the 
total amount of work done.

It reduces the amount of work that must be done by the watchers. It does 
nothing to the amount of work that must be done by the notifiers. And it 
increases the amount of work that must be done by the "subscription 
aggregator". (From nothing to somewhat more than the total of what would 
otherwise have been done by the watchers.)

But I think one of the goals here is to reduce the load on the servers.

I thing this would require defining a new event type 
('multiple-events'?), together with the content type used by it. The 
content type would have to be able to embed the notification content for 
any of the aggregated event types.  Not rocket science - definitely 
could be done.

I agree it is "cleaner" in the sense that it doesn't change the 
semantics of anything currently existing. But we will have to agree on 
what our goals are before we can decide what is "better".

There are a few requirements that need to be met for emergecny calls:

1) determine the call is an emergency call
2) determine where the UAC is
3) route the call set-up messages to the appropriate PSAP for that UAC
4) update the location of the UAC to the PSAP if the UAC moves

#1 above is solved by Henning's sos@ document

#2 is hard. There are several documents addressing this (RFC3825, Henning's=
=20
civic version that's still an ID), and there is GPS locally to the UAC, or=
=20
manual configuration. The hardest part of #2 is that this needs to be good=
=20
100% of the time, meaning something has to be statefully aware of the UAC's=
=20
location wherever it is every second of every day (I feel I'm repeating=20
myself). So, is that statefulness in the UAC or in a server (or series of=20
servers) within a domain/realm? The most scalable location for this=20
information is in the UAC. Getting the info to the UAC is easy for wired=20
and limited range wireless devices. It gets harder for longer range=20
wireless devices.

I believe in the US that cellular location determination is conveyed on the=
=20
PSAP operator's terminal something like 15 seconds after the call is placed=
=20
to the PSAP. This means the call is routed to the most likely PSAP based on=
=20
the originating cell tower the signal came from. Once at the PSAP, sw there=
=20
goes out and searches for the actual location of the caller (cell twoer=20
triangulation providing GPS coordinates - which get mapped to a street map=
=20
database, which generates a street address for where the caller is).

#3 can be solved once the location of the UAC is determined and forwarded=20
to the PSAP, because each should have a database to resolve the specific=20
location of the UAC to its proper PSAP. The ECRIT WG is chartered with=20
solving this.

Once any PSAP receives the call, it should be able to "transfer" the call=20
to the more appropriate PSAP (if the original PSAP wasn't the correct one).=
=20
This should direct and could be over quite secure communications between=20
PSAPs that know each other through an SA.

#4 is not so hard if the UAC knows its location and determines it has=20
moved. At last year's Minneeapolis meeting, the WG was quite clear that the=
=20
UPDATE Method is to be used by the UAC to update its location even after=20
the dialog has been established.

If the UAC does not know its location, then whatever is statefully aware of=
=20
the UAC's location will have to convey that change in UAC location to the=20
PSAP about the UAC. I'm not sure at all what message that would be. Would=20
the Proxy originate an UPDATE message towards the PSAP UAS that the=20
original UAC knows nothing about? I can see that being messy, as I can see=
=20
the (PSAP) UAS 200 OKing to the user's UAC (which would be ignored because=
=20
it didn't originate the UPDATE).

Agree.

There is also the issue of minimizing the *amount* of state. For a 
server that already operates on behalf of a particular set of AORs, the 
subscription state can be as small as one bit (publish to the AOR or 
not), up to complete dialog state plus subscription state:
- from tag, to tag, dialog id
- local and remote CSeq
- route set
- local and remote target URI
- event id
- event parameters
- subscription expiration timer
- subscription filters
- ...

The rule-maker's ability to set policies is completely unrelated to the =
protocol means by which location information is embedded in messages. =
The entity that serves location information, ultimately, must be =
responsible for seeing that the rule-maker's policies are enforced. This =
can be accomplished if that entity has access to the user's policies and =
implements them, regardless of how location information is mechanically =
inserted into signaling.

If the location information is added by-reference in a header, then no =
privacy-impacting information will appear in the message itself. =
Entities that want the location information will have to dereference the =
artifact in the header, and in that deferencing process, as well as in =
the object yielded by dereferencing, policies can be enforced.

All that is true, but I'm not convinced that there aren't ways for a =
proxy server to associate location information with a request that don't =
involve this degree of client support, and which can still provide the =
necessary GEOPRIV protections. At a high level, I am also very =
sympathetic to Mr. Elwell's concern that there are likely to be =
environments where the proxy server (let's say the local layer-7 domain) =
knows your location information, even when the endpoint and even the =
access network does not. Worse, I fear there might be environments where =
the local layer-7 domain might not even want to tell endpoints what it =
knows about location information directly.

Just putting the raw location information as a text field in a header =
without any of the protections mandated by GEOPRIV is not a good idea, I =
agree. Since a message body can contain a full GEOPRIV object, it is a =
better place to put location information by-value than a header. =
However, that doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't viable =
approaches to location conveyance that involve headers. Placing a =
reference to location information in a header, rather than the location =
information itself, would be an example.

I think PUBLISH solves a lot of problems that I highlighted about long
lasting subscriptions with little notification traffic.=20
In order to address the issue of installing such a subscription one
could argue for a new method like REGISTER (say SUBSCRIBE FOR PUBLISH)
that installs this dialog-less subscription at the NOTIFIER (which the
NOTIFIER may delegate to an abstract subscription store). The "SUBSCRIBE
for PUBLISH" may install that subscription for an AoR and when the event
is to be generated the NOTIFIER may send a PUBLISH using the regular SIP
routing mechanism (potentially looking up a location service or presence
information).
As Dale wrote below "SUBSCRIBE is optimized for the situation where
subscriptions are relatively short lived, and the state they receive
changes quite frequently."=20
We need a mechanism that could be optimized for subscriptions that are
long lived and state changes very infrequently.=20
So SUBSCRIBERS can have the option to use regular SUBSCRIBE or
"SUBSCRIBE for PUBLISH", the latter if correctly implemented may just
result in a subscription record at the NOTIFIER end and nothing more.=20

There is also the issue of minimizing the *amount* of state. For a=20
server that already operates on behalf of a particular set of AORs, the=20
subscription state can be as small as one bit (publish to the AOR or=20
not), up to complete dialog state plus subscription state:
- from tag, to tag, dialog id
- local and remote CSeq
- route set
- local and remote target URI
- event id
- event parameters
- subscription expiration timer
- subscription filters

Let's not get stuck on method names here. Whether state is delivered 
using NOTIFY, PUBLISH, or INFO makes no difference here. PUBLISH doesn't 
solve your problems any more than INFO or MESSAGE does. Less, in fact, 
because in most cases PUBLISHes sent to the AoR already have a place to 
go, namely the compositor for that event package that in many cases is a 
network based server. So UAs or end user devices will actually never end 
up seeing those messages.

Ok, so the requirement is to be able to subscribe using an AoR instead 
of a more volatile contact address. Perhaps a GRUU can solve this issue?

Another requirement I gather from this is to minimize the amount of 
state kept per subscription. Are you saying that the current amount, 
i.e., dialog state, is too much? How so? You're bound to have to store 
at least some state for these subscriptions, at a minimum the 
subscriber's address of record.

And no-where is it mandated that subscriptions, as they are currently 
specified, have to be stored in volatile memory. You are free to store 
the state wherever you want, including non-volatile storage or an 
"abstract subscription store". This is an implementation issue.

> As Dale wrote below "SUBSCRIBE is optimized for the situation where

Right, and we may have some work to do to make the long-lasting 
subscriptions work better. We already have such event packages as the 
certificate event, in which subscriptions are measured in days, instead 
of hours.

Right. So let's articulate the requirements and start working on 
improving on SIP events to solve them.

I don't see PUBLISH as a silver bullet here.

Cheers,
Aki

Hello, all.

I am newbie in SIP. I have a question as subject says.
There are various efforts (including STUN, ICE, rport, symmetric RTP, TURN, etc.) to solve NAT traversal problem for SIP and media session. 
I think rport can be used for NAT traversal of media session as well as SIP signalling. What I have in mind is as follows. 
UAC can send INVITE request to itself using IP address(private) and port which it want to use for media session as source ip and source port. Then, outbound proxy which is on public side receives the INVITE message and inserts received and rport fields into via header because source IP address and port given by NAT are different those in via header. So, UAC can obtain its public IP address and port associated by NAT only if it can receive inbound call request. 
If I am not wrong, this can be a limited solution like STUN. 
Any comments or advices?

Thanks in advance.

James,

All of what you say is reasonable in the general context of location.
However, for emergency calls I would have thought the risk of divulging
location information at a proxy would be better than not supplying location
information at all (which would be the case if the UAC does not have
appropriate support).

John

All,

I've submitted a new I-D that discusses in detail some of the issues 
that have also come up in this thread, as well as proposes some 
potential solutions. Until it appears in the archives, you can fetch a 
copy at:

http://people.nokia.net/~aki/drafts/draft-niemi-sipping-subnot-issues-00.txt

Also: please direct discussion of the draft over to SIPPING, as I think 
it belongs there more than in SIP.

Cheers,
Aki

Hi,

if you are interested in such model, I suggest you write a concrete 
proposal in an I-D explaining how the direct signalling between A and B 
would relate to the session. Effectively, you would have two endpoints 
in a conference using T as the conference bridge with an additional 
direct signalling relationship between the endpoints.

The general question you would need to address in such an I-D would be 
how to correlate several SIP dialogs (each of which may have an 
associated media session) so that all its associated media sessions are 
treated as a single media session at the endpoints.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Subscribing using an AOR for a contact just creates new problems. There 
may be multiple contacts registered for that AOR, so a message (e.g. 
PUBLISH) addressed to the AOR may (or may not) be forked to all the 
registered contacts, and the forking may be serial or parallel. Once one 
fork succeeds there is no reason to believe an attempt will be made to 
deliver the message to the other contacts.

For instance, if you have two phones registered for the same AOR, and a 
MWI status was PUBLISHed to the AOR, it might just get to one of the phones.

For this technique to be useful, we need a way to ensure that all valid 
candidate contacts are attempted. Its especially tricky if you want to 
ensure delivery to all contacts, or have the sender learn of the failures.

There could still be a solution down this path. But it will require a 
bunch of work.

Not just subscribers. Notifiers too.

I find it interesting to see what you chose to include and omit as 
requirements. My reaction is that I think there need to be more 
requirements. That may mean that there will need to be a range of 
different behaviors in order to satisfy everyone.

In general I would characterize what I hear as a desire to minimize some 
metric over the system that includes the "subscribers", "publishers", 
and any intermediaries. The optimization may include some or all of the 
elements in the system. (E.g. state storage in subscribers may not be 
important.)

The following are a couple that I have heard expressed one way or another:

- "subscriber" doesn't want to subscribe at all, or maintain any
   subscription state. Would rather just handle "notifications"
   as context free events. Expects notifications to be delivered to
   it as result of external configuration that it has no involvement
   with.

- "notifier" doesn't want to maintain any state about those interested
   it. It prefers to just "publish" interesting info about itself to
   one place. (Note that this can be achieved by publishing to an
   event state agent which carries the rest of the load.)

I think we have two orthogonal dimensions:

- conferring location by value or by reference;

- carrying location in the header or in a body part.

All four combinations are possible. In particular, there is no 
restriction on the length of headers in SIP and the likely length of a 
location header is no larger than, say, a bunch of Via headers. Like any 
  XML object, it can be secured (authenticated, encrypted) using XMLDSIG.

There are general trade-offs between 'by value' and 'by reference'. 'By 
value' ensures atomicity - wherever the request goes, the by-value 
information goes as well. This happens to be important for emergency 
calling since emergency calls are often forwarded and redirected to a 
variety of parties with need-to-know, including backup PSAPs and first 
responders.

On the other hand, by-reference allows to differentiate access to call 
information from access to location information. (However, XMLDSIG also 
allows this to some extent, in a PK context.)

By-reference is also likely to be smaller in the SIP request, but the 
overall system byte efficiency may well be less - after all, the 
entities needing the location information will likely have to set up a 
connection (TCP, TLS, whatever) to the location server, with the time 
and space overhead of that setup swamping the object size itself.

By reference also means that there's a violation of fate sharing - a 
call may fail due to the inability of a proxy to dereference the 
location pointer, e.g., due to network failures, server overload, NAT 
issues, race conditions or authentication failures.

Thus, I think it would be helpful to look at this more systematically 
and from a whole-systems perspective.

John

I'm not understanding your comment - but will comment enough (I hope) to 
tease its meaning out. You talk about a risk in divulging location 
information, and I'm wondering how location can be inserted into a SIP 
message first.

A comment on the former (divulging):

The risk of divulging location is still a privacy choice today in the US. 
You can choose in some jurisdictions to not reveal your location even when 
dialing 911 in the PSTN. I would never do that, but it's possible. So, in 
my estimation, a similar local law will be addressing divulging location 
information over VoIP in that same jurisdiction - if the current law 
doesn't.  What do we do about this? Ignore it, or build into the protocol a 
means for obeying this knowledge law that will be imposed on vendors 
selling into that jurisdiction?

Now to the latter topic (location insertion in SIP messages):

SIP Servers (other than versions of B2BUAs) cannot insert a message body of 
any kind today according to RFC 3261 (agreed?). Recent discussions within 
the WG has this stipulation continuing.

So, in order to meet what you want, this server will need to add location 
as a SIP header. Which one? I don't believe one exists today that could 
satisfy this request/requirement. That's ok. This ID can invent one if 
necessary. Say the location header of the form:

         Location: <something>

where <something> is one of 4 choices. It is either :

1) a predetermined coordinate format like GPS (including a datum value)
2) a predetermined civic address format (with some indication if this is a 
postal address, a legal address or a billing address),
3) it is a freeform open string in cleartext,
4) or it is a URL to a reference on a server

#1 above is like the text version of RFC3825 or GPS
#2 above is like Henning's civic ID at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil-06.txt
but will be more difficult in format in have
#3 above is what it says - freeform cleartext like a token
#4 above is a URL to a record on a server that has potentially all format 
versions of location and provides the ability to challenge the requestor 
for credentials before divulging the location of the UAC.

BTW - you don't want the challenge in #4 to fail giving location out in a 
911 call for call routing or responder dispatch.

#4 above could also be a very long header-value (>100 characters), if that 
matters

One issue I have with option#4 above is that this means everytime I (for 
example) want to provide my location to someone else, I have to give this 
URL-based header out, or believe my SP will (because my UA doesn't know 
how). This is a means for the owner of the server the URL lives on to 
charge for that revelation of information, kinda like a dip into a PSTN 
database. Do we want to create that mechanism for all location revelation? 
Or just for a very limited few instances where the SIP UA cannot handle 
providing its location? I'm open to the latter here, but know it's 
uncontrollable once built.

If location was only for 911 type services, this is the best place for it.

For a location industry to have to bow the limitation of having some other 
entity always in the mix makes things inefficient at best.

Henning

This is a good argument for analysis (I do not disagree with anything you 
wrote below), but this doesn't exactly help me in the short term in which I 
have to update the Location ID (by next Monday morning).

Do I create the Location by reference header (with supporting requirements 
and scemantic text for it)?

Or

Do we continue this analysis before I modify the ID?

I believe that once it's in the ID, it'll be hard to take out.

comments please

There seems to be sufficient confusion about the various options and 
their properties that clearly documenting their engineering trade-offs 
might speed convergence on a solution. Once we agree on the properties, 
we might be better able to decide which ones are important and whether 
these are complementary solutions that offer different trade-offs and 
should be pursued.

Since the abstract calls the document "framework and requirements", it 
seems helpful to capture some of the trade-offs, particularly since the 
discussion takes place in two, if not three, working groups, leading to 
a fair amount of re-hash or partial discussions.

I'm happy to send text.

I'd be a fool to not accept a text offering.

I think it best to create a separate subsection dealing with this topic in 
the framework&Requirements section rather than integrating anything 
throughout the doc, as the rest of the doc - 60% of it - is a solution set 
per SIP Method, per conveyance type (e2e or Proxy-Routing)

This new subsection gives a point of discussion I can bring out in the WG 
presentation on this ID too.

Hi Cullen, Rohan,

Looks good.

Some minor comments:

- You explain briefly where the 500-600s come from in section 4.2, and
also the=20
  25-30s.

- I would use something more explicit that "stun" for the URI parameter
name.=20
  Perhaps something like "sip-stun" or something similar. This is to
avoid people=20
  confusing it with the "normal" STUN server used for media.

- In section 7, the wording seems to imply that the support for STUN on
a SIP UDP
  signalling port is mandatory, which is not acceptable. I don't believe
that all=20
  registrars will want to support a native SIP-STUN server. Furthermore,
  one may decide that if sip-outbound  connections (e.g., for NAT) are
supported,=20
  then the UA would have to do TCP. The Registrar or Proxy needs to be
able to NOT
  support SIP-STUN. I think this is the point of the stun URI parameter,
but the
  wording is a little ambiguous.

- On that same point, I'd like to clarify the stun URI parameter.
  Is this for the Request-URI that would be sent to the Registrar?
Something
  like sip:example.com;stun? If this is the case, then the fact that the
registrar
  uses the stun parameter as part of it's request-URI would mean that it
supports=20
  a SIP-STUN server. Some more details and an example would help.

Cheer.

[JRE] I was not aware of that situation in the US. So maybe insertion by a
proxy can be done only in jurisdications where this is allowed without user
consent. Otherwise, if the UAC does not indicate support for receiving
location information in a 4xx response and resubmitting the request, then
the emergency call just has to proceed without location information.

[JRE] I have a tendency towards 4), but I don't pretend to have a grasp of
all the pros and cons yet.

[JRE] No, the UA can still provide location in a body. The URL alternative
would just be for proxy use for an emergency call where the UAC is unable to
insert location information.

Yes, and this can be interesting.
But we need an ID first to see what is exactly meant and can then discuss =

Hi,

if you are interested in such model, I suggest you write a concrete=20
proposal in an I-D explaining how the direct signalling between A and B=20
would relate to the session. Effectively, you would have two endpoints=20
in a conference using T as the conference bridge with an additional=20
direct signalling relationship between the endpoints.

The general question you would need to address in such an I-D would be=20
how to correlate several SIP dialogs (each of which may have an=20
associated media session) so that all its associated media sessions are=20
treated as a single media session at the endpoints.

Thanks,

Gonzalo

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: End-to-middle Security in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: K. Ono, S. Tachimoto
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-e2m-sec-00.txt
	Pages		: 20
	Date		: 2005-7-12
	
   Some services provided by intermediaries depend on their ability to
   inspect a message body in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   When sensitive information is included in the message body, a SIP
   User Agent (UA) needs to protect it from other intermediaries than
   those that the UA agreed to disclose it to.  This document proposes a
   mechanism for securing information passed between an end user and
   intermediaries using S/MIME.  It also proposes mechanisms for a UA to
   discover intermediaries which need to inspect an S/MIME-secured
   message body, or to receive the message body with data integrity.

Most aren't - and I don't know of one that is using it. I've talked to 
folks that run PSAPs and they have to account for it, so I know it exists. 
I think I remember it originated in the state Georgia (but this is only a 
guess), and has since gone to some other states. I have not confirmed how 
wide location-anonimity this is.

exactly - I have text stating the subsequent SIP Request needs to pass 
through the Proxy without a 425 Response. I can make that more 
clear/highlighted

oh... that's different. I fully agree we should do as much as we can for 
UAs that cannot support this extension.

I'll float that variant of this scenario in the preso in Paris to see if 
the wg agrees. I have no problems with this as you stated it.

This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Managing Client Initiated Connections in the 
                          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: C. Jennings, R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-outbound-00.txt

   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate
   TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in
   order to deliver requests.  However, many practical considerations,
   such as the existence of firewalls and NATs, prevent servers from
   connecting to User Agents in this way.  Even when a proxy server can
   open a TCP connection to a User Agent, most User Agents lack a
   certificate suitable to act as a TLS server.  This specification
   defines behaviors for user agents, registrars and proxy servers that
   allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by
   the User Agent.  It also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep
   NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections for
   high availability systems.

Hi,

According to RFC 3842, we can only send one MWI information related to one 
user account,
We can have MWI info present for multiple user accounts, as it will result

Hi,

Why transport error handling by server transaction is different from
handling by client transaction?
According to sec 17.1.4 client trasanction passes error to TU. But in
sec 17.2.4 server transaction is being asked to follow rfc 3263. Why
can't server transaction also pass the error to TU.

regards,
-nins

We are researching possible ways of performing PSTN call routing at a
Tandem switch that receives calls from an (or more) end-office switch
over a SIP interconnection. The tandem switch is responsible for
determining the type of the call and completing it to either the Local,
Local-toll or Long-distance PSTN trunk based on the call type. Based on
the current regulations, the call typing would have to be based on the
perspective of the originating switch rather than the tandem. Is there
any discussions in the SIP forum with regards to how SIP could be used
to convey the right information (either as call-type, rate-center
information or otherwise) to facilitate such call routing at the tandem?

The current alternatives that we are investigating are:

1. Find a standardized means of conveying the call-type information to
the tandem: The tandem switch would then use the combination of called
party number and call-type information to route the call to the
appropriate PSTN trunk. We are not, however, able to identify any
standard means of conveying this information.

2. Use a combination of calling and called party number information at
the tandem to perform the call typing: Our preliminary investigation
reveals that maintaining such a list of possible calling and called
party number information in the tandem switch's dial-plan would make the
dial-plan very complex and large. To this end, this alternative, while
still being looked into, does not look promising.

3. Use multiple SIP interconnections between the End-office and the
tandem switch: This architecture would emulate the current set up in the
PSTN network, where the end-office typically uses specific trunks to
forward call calls to the tandem base on the call type. The problem with
this approach, of course, is that in a market that has multiple
switches, there would be multiple SIP interconnections that would have
to be established and maintained, which we would like to avoid if
possible. The use of a single SIP interconnection between the switches
would make the implementation much more scalable and an improvement over
the current PSTN methodology.

We would be really interested in the forums feedback on the
alternatives. Are there other alternatives, from past discussions or
current drafts/RFCs that may be in progress, that we should look into as
well?

Thank you

I'm assuming that what you want is for the end-office switch to classify the
call, but the tandem switch would be acting on that classification?

One method would be for the end-office switch, while it was working out how
to forward the call, to attach a URI parameter to the request-URI.  The
tandem would examine (and remove) the URI parameter to determine how to
route the call.

At a very high level:
------------------------------
IMS specifications have been laid to harness the 3G network's access
technology and also provide multimedia services to wireless
devices. IMS subsystem would be aware of the
characteristics of the real-time data to be transported,
codec to be used, IP addresses alongwith the port numbers,
apply error correction, header compression, required QoS
etc. beyond what can be achieved over the packet-switched
domain.
IMS subsystem consists of various SIP proxies referred to
as Call Session Control Functions (CSCF). The IMS
specifications describes three types of CSCFs:
i) Proxy- CSCF: connects wireless device to IMS subsystem
ii) Serving - CSCF: provides services to the users, which they
subscribe to. Each wireless device is associated with an S-CSCF on SIP
registration. The
incoming and outgoing sessions passes through it. Home
Subscriber Server (HSS) maintains the information
about S-CSCF and user's association. HSS knows the
users location and subscribed services.
iii) Interrogating - CSCF:  locates the associated S-CSCF for a user
and routes the request to it.

For details, please refer to what Ranjit has mentioned.

regards,
Prabhas

Folks,

I've just submitted an update to the gruu spec. Until it appears in the 
archives, you can pick up a copy at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-04.txt

The changes from -03 are:

* included up front discussion on properties of URIs, and how GRUU is
merely a property of a URI. Application of other properties is a
domain policy and not determinable from inspection of the URI

* defined the opaque URI parameter, included grammar for it and a URI
parameter registration. Defined its usage with gruu and gave examples
of applicability to other things.

* usage of the opaque parameter for construction of a GRUU is
recommended, unless the anonymity property is also desired. The text
describes how a UA can extract the AOR when it has a gruu that was
constructed using an opaque parameter

* added example algorithm for gruu construction using the opaque
parameter, and removed the hashed indices algorithm that was
previously there

* procedure for allowing an edge proxy to remove itself from the
record-route in order to eliminate spirals, was documented

* Previously, the REGISTER response didnt need the Require header
field with gruu. This is wrong; it does. It is now mandated with MUST
strength

* updated examples to use recommended basic gruu construction
algorithm. It also now uses the conventions in
draft-ietf-sipping-torture-tests to deal with long lines in example
messages

* fixed big bug in grammar, which had omitted the "<" and ">" from the
definitions of the +sip.instance contact header field parameter.

* a registrar no longer deletes a previous registration with the same
instance ID; instead, it simply elects not to use it when proxying a
request. This has the same overall effect but is more compatible with
the behavior in sipping-outbound. The gruu spec defines procedures for
processing requests sent to an AOR and a GRUU as a result

* added a paragraph on administratively created gruus for cases where
the proxy and UA instance are co-located; for network servers like
gateways and voicemail servers, who have public dns entries and IP,
they would simply construct a gruu and use it

* more detailed recommendations on how to apply the service treatment
property to gruus

* clarified the usage of the angle brackets in the instance ID Contact
parameter.

* updated the UML to fix some missing and incorrect cardinalities

* there was an example that talked about how two contacts registered to
different AOR, but with the same instance ID, would get different gruu.
This example incorrectly used the same contact for each AOR, which a
client is not supposed to do. This was fixed.

* fixed bug in grammar, so that SIPS URI are allowed for a gruu

* fixed example register response in the examples section, which was
missing the gruu

* defined procedures for picking the gruu in an INVITE or 200 OK in
the case where an instance has registered against multiple AOR

* more precise definitions on when a proxy sends a 404 vs. a 480; a
480 is sent if the AOR of the gruu is known but the instance ID is not

* security considerations section has a discussion on why its not that
important to hide the aor and instance ID


Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Just a quick clarification.  IMS is not just about wireless technology, =
even though it is primarily defined in 3GPP.  In 3GPP R6, IMS specs were =
altered to make them access agnostic and thus allow IMS to be utilised =
by any access (DSL, WLAN, FTTx) in such a way that an end user should =
receive common service and common touch and feel regardless of how they =
get to the IMS domain itself.

This paradigm is being used by the ETSI TISPAN work on NGN, where new =
service requirements are driving further extensions of IMS to allow for =
the deployment of a PSTN-like voice service using IMS.  There is also =
NGN work based on IMS taking place in ATIS, ITU-T, MSF and others.

Also, to clarify the references, 3GPP TS 24.229 defines the SIP profile =
used in IMS between CSCF's, AS's and other devices, but there is a lot =
more to IMS than just the SIP components - for example the =
Diameter-SIP-Application work in AAA WG was originally driven by IMS - =
so for an overview of the architecture and signalling flows, you may be =
better of looking at 3GPP TS 23.228.  You might also like to look at =
draft-jesske-sipping-tispan-requirements-01.txt and =
draft-jesske-sipping-tispan-analysis-00.txt for some detail of what is =
being proposed in terms of new services in TISPAN.

As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place information in its specifications that enable reuse by other organisations, as well as those that are requirements for 3GPP operation.
 
Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, you may find requirements in individual specifications that are not intended to be implemented by networks belonging to operators with GERAN or UTRAN attachments only. These requirements may be endorsed in the specifications of ETSI TISPAN, or other organisations.
 
Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed amendments to 3GPP TS 24.229 which specify attachment of terminals to an IMS through an XDSL system. These are still work in progress.
 
Finally note that most people in 3GPP participate in IETF as individuals and not as representatives of 3GPP, see RFC 3113. There is only one 3GPP liaison representative appointed by 3GPP TSG SA (along with IETF representation in the oppposite direction).

Just a quick clarification.  IMS is not just about wireless technology, even though it is primarily defined in 3GPP.  In 3GPP R6, IMS specs were altered to make them access agnostic and thus allow IMS to be utilised by any access (DSL, WLAN, FTTx) in such a way that an end user should receive common service and common touch and feel regardless of how they get to the IMS domain itself.

.......

[RRR] It seems to be confusing so far 3GPP works are conerned. The idea that 3GPP's IMS is propgating the following: The access is specific to cellular wireless, however, cellular wireless users need to have services that IMS is defining. So, IMS may have some aspects that may be used for other kinds of access technologies like Cable, DSL, Wireless LANs, FTTx, and others, but 3GPP has NEVER defined any criteria that it has NOW transformed itself to be access agnostic. 

[RRR] If 3GPP does so, it will be a mountain shfit for 3GPP in its charter, architecture, and requirements to propel in the IETF for SIP, SIPPING, AAA, and related WGs. In fact, in another thread in NSIS for a contribution on behalf of 3GPP, I mentioned that they should focus on access agnostic aspects of QOS in terms of mobility instead of just cellular wireless access.

[RRR] The question is this: Let us involve 3GPP as a whole to make clear (instead of individual contributions here and thers assuming that they do NOT respresent 3GPP) what is their actual motivation for providing contributions in IETF for creating standards? Is it only specific to cellular wireless access? Or, is it access agnostic?

OK, Good.

The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic specifications =
in the IETF?
=20
If not, kindly summarize this to us as you seem to be working on behalf =
of 3GPP in coordination with 3GPP- IETF liaison as we are NOT aware of =
those 3GPP specs (unlike IETF, access to final specs are limited to 3GPP =

First thanks to Keith for summarising what I was about to post very long =
windedly.
=20
Second, 3GPP specs ARE available in their final versions without the =
need for 3GPP membership.  Go to www.3gpp.org, click specifications and =
you can download all and any (including drafts of specs being worked =
on). =20
=20
Last, 3GPP is working for extensions and definitions in IETF that enable =
IMS to support all and any access type.  There will be some access =
dependent elements in the specification but they will not be mandatory =
requirements.  The variations will depend on the nature of the service =
being provided.  For example the current debate on the SIPPING list with =
regard to the regulatory requirements on voice services is in some cases =
not applicable to a mobile voice service but is of very real concern to =
fixed line voice service providers.  One only needs to see what is =
happening between Skype and the FCC to see what can happen when =
regulatory considerations are not adhered to by voice providers.

OK, Good.
=20
The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic specifications =
in the IETF?
=20
If not, kindly summarize this to us as you seem to be working on behalf =
of 3GPP in coordination with 3GPP- IETF liaison as we are NOT aware of =
those 3GPP specs (unlike IETF, access to final specs are limited to 3GPP =

As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place information =
in its specifications that enable reuse by other organisations, as well =
as those that are requirements for 3GPP operation.
=20
Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, you =
may find requirements in individual specifications that are not intended =
to be implemented by networks belonging to operators with GERAN or UTRAN =
attachments only. These requirements may be endorsed in the =
specifications of ETSI TISPAN, or other organisations.
=20
Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed =
amendments to 3GPP TS 24.229 which specify attachment of terminals to an =
IMS through an XDSL system. These are still work in progress.
=20
Finally note that most people in 3GPP participate in IETF as individuals =

Got carried away there... TISPAN is working for extensions in IETF.  =
Those extensions will then ultimately be incorporated in new versions of =
existing 3GPP specifications.

First thanks to Keith for summarising what I was about to post very long =
windedly.
=20
Second, 3GPP specs ARE available in their final versions without the =
need for 3GPP membership.  Go to www.3gpp.org, click specifications and =
you can download all and any (including drafts of specs being worked =
on). =20
=20
Last, 3GPP is working for extensions and definitions in IETF that enable =
IMS to support all and any access type.  There will be some access =
dependent elements in the specification but they will not be mandatory =
requirements.  The variations will depend on the nature of the service =
being provided.  For example the current debate on the SIPPING list with =
regard to the regulatory requirements on voice services is in some cases =
not applicable to a mobile voice service but is of very real concern to =
fixed line voice service providers.  One only needs to see what is =
happening between Skype and the FCC to see what can happen when =
regulatory considerations are not adhered to by voice providers.

OK, Good.
=20
The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic specifications =
in the IETF?
=20
If not, kindly summarize this to us as you seem to be working on behalf =
of 3GPP in coordination with 3GPP- IETF liaison as we are NOT aware of =
those 3GPP specs (unlike IETF, access to final specs are limited to 3GPP =
members only).

As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place information =
in its specifications that enable reuse by other organisations, as well =
as those that are requirements for 3GPP operation.
=20
Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, you =
may find requirements in individual specifications that are not intended =
to be implemented by networks belonging to operators with GERAN or UTRAN =
attachments only. These requirements may be endorsed in the =
specifications of ETSI TISPAN, or other organisations.
=20
Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed =
amendments to 3GPP TS 24.229 which specify attachment of terminals to an =
IMS through an XDSL system. These are still work in progress.
=20
Finally note that most people in 3GPP participate in IETF as individuals =
and not as representatives of 3GPP, see RFC 3113. There is only one 3GPP =
liaison representative appointed by 3GPP TSG SA (along with IETF =
representation in the oppposite direction).

I referred in my original mail to RFC 3113, which I assume you can gain access to without further subscription or payment.
 
This tells you exactly how you gain access to 3GPP documents, and that they are available to everybody with IP access.
 
Indeed if you look in the right place you can gain access to every version of every specification (bar about 3 on the security algorithms) that has existed electronically. Similarly you can also gain access to the vast majority of the internal working documents that have existed since 3GPP was created, if you really have the patience to work through them.
 
Obviously 3GPP specifications are published by the member SDOs, but as far as I understand, none of the publishing SDOs amend the contents of those 3GPP specifications from those appearing on the 3GPP site, and indeed the ETSI ones are also available free of charge for the minor pain of giving your name and email address before you obtain them.
 
regards
 
Keith

OK, Good.
 
The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic specifications in the IETF?
 
If not, kindly summarize this to us as you seem to be working on behalf of 3GPP in coordination with 3GPP- IETF liaison as we are NOT aware of those 3GPP specs (unlike IETF, access to final specs are limited to 3GPP members only).
 
Best regards,

As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place information in its specifications that enable reuse by other organisations, as well as those that are requirements for 3GPP operation.
 
Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, you may find requirements in individual specifications that are not intended to be implemented by networks belonging to operators with GERAN or UTRAN attachments only. These requirements may be endorsed in the specifications of ETSI TISPAN, or other organisations.
 
Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed amendments to 3GPP TS 24.229 which specify attachment of terminals to an IMS through an XDSL system. These are still work in progress.
 
Finally note that most people in 3GPP participate in IETF as individuals and not as representatives of 3GPP, see RFC 3113. There is only one 3GPP liaison representative appointed by 3GPP TSG SA (along with IETF representation in the oppposite direction).

Just a quick clarification.  IMS is not just about wireless technology, even though it is primarily defined in 3GPP.  In 3GPP R6, IMS specs were altered to make them access agnostic and thus allow IMS to be utilised by any access (DSL, WLAN, FTTx) in such a way that an end user should receive common service and common touch and feel regardless of how they get to the IMS domain itself.

.......

[RRR] It seems to be confusing so far 3GPP works are conerned. The idea that 3GPP's IMS is propgating the following: The access is specific to cellular wireless, however, cellular wireless users need to have services that IMS is defining. So, IMS may have some aspects that may be used for other kinds of access technologies like Cable, DSL, Wireless LANs, FTTx, and others, but 3GPP has NEVER defined any criteria that it has NOW transformed itself to be access agnostic. 

[RRR] If 3GPP does so, it will be a mountain shfit for 3GPP in its charter, architecture, and requirements to propel in the IETF for SIP, SIPPING, AAA, and related WGs. In fact, in another thread in NSIS for a contribution on behalf of 3GPP, I mentioned that they should focus on access agnostic aspects of QOS in terms of mobility instead of just cellular wireless access.

[RRR] The question is this: Let us involve 3GPP as a whole to make clear (instead of individual contributions here and thers assuming that they do NOT respresent 3GPP) what is their actual motivation for providing contributions in IETF for creating standards? Is it only specific to cellular wireless access? Or, is it access agnostic?

Excellent!
=20
In fact, let me summarize as follows:
=20
1. Contributions are being made (or will be made) keeping the big =
picture in mind that include the entire ETSI family including 3GPP.
=20
2. Primary focus of standardization in the IETF from ETSI point of view =
is "Access Independent." These contributions will generally be along the =
line of the standard track RFCs.
=20
3. Some contributions many be "access-specific (e.g., cellular wireless, =
Wireless LANs, others)," and may have some optional features. Most =
likely, they will be "Informational RFCs."
=20
4. Regulatory features might also influence some aspects =
standardization.
=20
Now, it will help us to review the contributions (ETSI/3GPP) focusing =
the above.
=20
Many thanks for clarifications.
=20
Best regards,
Radhika

Got carried away there... TISPAN is working for extensions in IETF.  =
Those extensions will then ultimately be incorporated in new versions of =
existing 3GPP specifications.
=20
But then we're all one big happy family in ETSI land.

	First thanks to Keith for summarising what I was about to post very =
long windedly.
	=20
	Second, 3GPP specs ARE available in their final versions without the =
need for 3GPP membership.  Go to www.3gpp.org, click specifications and =
you can download all and any (including drafts of specs being worked =
on). =20
	=20
	Last, 3GPP is working for extensions and definitions in IETF that =
enable IMS to support all and any access type.  There will be some =
access dependent elements in the specification but they will not be =
mandatory requirements.  The variations will depend on the nature of the =
service being provided.  For example the current debate on the SIPPING =
list with regard to the regulatory requirements on voice services is in =
some cases not applicable to a mobile voice service but is of very real =
concern to fixed line voice service providers.  One only needs to see =
what is happening between Skype and the FCC to see what can happen when =
regulatory considerations are not adhered to by voice providers.

		OK, Good.
		=20
		The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic =
specifications in the IETF?
		=20
		If not, kindly summarize this to us as you seem to be working on =
behalf of 3GPP in coordination with 3GPP- IETF liaison as we are NOT =
aware of those 3GPP specs (unlike IETF, access to final specs are =
limited to 3GPP members only).

		As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place =
information in its specifications that enable reuse by other =
organisations, as well as those that are requirements for 3GPP =
operation.
		=20
		Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, =
you may find requirements in individual specifications that are not =
intended to be implemented by networks belonging to operators with GERAN =
or UTRAN attachments only. These requirements may be endorsed in the =
specifications of ETSI TISPAN, or other organisations.
		=20
		Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed =
amendments to 3GPP TS 24.229 which specify attachment of terminals to an =
IMS through an XDSL system. These are still work in progress.
		=20
		Finally note that most people in 3GPP participate in IETF as =
individuals and not as representatives of 3GPP, see RFC 3113. There is =
only one 3GPP liaison representative appointed by 3GPP TSG SA (along =
with IETF representation in the oppposite direction).

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User
                          Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the Session
                          Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-gruu-04.txt
	Pages		: 38
	Date		: 2005-7-14
	
Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
   a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used
   by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA
   instance.  A URI which routes to a specific UA instance is called a
   Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  This document describes an
   extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a server, and for
   communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-04.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the

You are right that I can access to all 3GPP working documents. In fact, =
I have been accessing many of those documents since the inception of =
3GPP. It seems to me that the scope of 3GPP works is very big and it is =
not so easy to keep track for all of them for all those years with so =
many versions.
=20
However, the access to the standardized documents is very limited. One =
can access only 3 times. More than this, the access is not provided =
unless one is the member of 3GPP.
=20
That is OK for the closed forum like 3GPP that does not provide =
unlimited access like that of the IETF.
=20
Recently, I proposed to contributors of closed forums (e.g., 3GPP) in =
NSIS WG as follows:
=20
1. Any standard documents of the closed forums that cannot be accessed =
publicly and referred by authors to place in the website (preferably by =
the author or by liaison member) that can be accessed freely by IETF =
members.
=20
2. Items that I mentioned in response to Dan's email.
=20
Thanks for helping us to know about 3GPP/ETSI.
=20
Best regards,
Radhika

I referred in my original mail to RFC 3113, which I assume you can gain =
access to without further subscription or payment.
=20
This tells you exactly how you gain access to 3GPP documents, and that =
they are available to everybody with IP access.
=20
Indeed if you look in the right place you can gain access to every =
version of every specification (bar about 3 on the security algorithms) =
that has existed electronically. Similarly you can also gain access to =
the vast majority of the internal working documents that have existed =
since 3GPP was created, if you really have the patience to work through =
them.
=20
Obviously 3GPP specifications are published by the member SDOs, but as =
far as I understand, none of the publishing SDOs amend the contents of =
those 3GPP specifications from those appearing on the 3GPP site, and =
indeed the ETSI ones are also available free of charge for the minor =
pain of giving your name and email address before you obtain them.

	OK, Good.

	The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic =

	As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place information =
in its specifications that enable reuse by other organisations, as well =
as those that are requirements for 3GPP operation.
	=20
	Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, =

	Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed =

		Just a quick clarification.  IMS is not just about wireless =
technology, even though it is primarily defined in 3GPP.  In 3GPP R6, =
IMS specs were altered to make them access agnostic and thus allow IMS =
to be utilised by any access (DSL, WLAN, FTTx) in such a way that an end =
user should receive common service and common touch and feel regardless =
of how they get to the IMS domain itself.

		.......
	=09
		[RRR] It seems to be confusing so far 3GPP works are conerned. The =
idea that 3GPP's IMS is propgating the following: The access is specific =
to cellular wireless, however, cellular wireless users need to have =
services that IMS is defining. So, IMS may have some aspects that may be =
used for other kinds of access technologies like Cable, DSL, Wireless =
LANs, FTTx, and others, but 3GPP has NEVER defined any criteria that it =
has NOW transformed itself to be access agnostic.=20

		[RRR] If 3GPP does so, it will be a mountain shfit for 3GPP in its =
charter, architecture, and requirements to propel in the IETF for SIP, =
SIPPING, AAA, and related WGs. In fact, in another thread in NSIS for a =
contribution on behalf of 3GPP, I mentioned that they should focus on =
access agnostic aspects of QOS in terms of mobility instead of just =
cellular wireless access.

		[RRR] The question is this: Let us involve 3GPP as a whole to make =
clear (instead of individual contributions here and thers assuming that =
they do NOT respresent 3GPP) what is their actual motivation for =
providing contributions in IETF for creating standards? Is it only =
specific to cellular wireless access? Or, is it access agnostic?

RFC 3966 defines the tel: URL scheme, and it allows for a "context" 
parameter.

I suggest you have the edge switch set the "context" parameter to 
indicate its perspective, then have the tandem siwtch act on that 
context.

Hi,


What I see the main advantage in this model is that it
would allow all the involved parties, including
trancoding server, to control the session and make
others aware of the changes. It does have the
limitation that the parties should support the
mentioned extension of SIP.


regards
Rayees

Hi Folks,

I just updated my SIP "loc" event package, which is used to carry 
geographic location. (See the announcement on the geopriv list.)  James 
Polk and I have not worked out its relationship to his SIP location 
conveyance draft.  In any case, the draft has a geopriv prefix, so I 
expect discussions on the content of my draft will happen in geopriv.  
If you have a comment about the scope or relevance of the draft as 
related to draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance, feel free to discuss 
that here.

thanks,
-rohan

I can only assume that you are referring to the versions of 3GPP documents published by ETSI, although I am not aware of any limitation there, although you do have to access it one document at the time. While the ETSI and 3GPP sites are hosted on common platforms, they have different domain names and you should be able to tell the difference.
 
On the 3GPP site there is no access limitation, and never has been. No 3GPP participants have accounts in order to access the 3GPP areas. I agree these are the copies before publication, but to be honest, this is what people implement from, and not the versions published by the SDOs. None of the SDOs make technical changes to the documents in publication.
 
So to repeat - go to one of the following:
 
www.3gpp.org <http://www.3gpp.org> 
http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/status-report.htm <http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/status-report.htm> 
 
and so on there should be no limitation.
 
If you have trouble, there are helpdesk contacts at both ETSI and 3GPP sites.
 
regards
 
Keith

You are right that I can access to all 3GPP working documents. In fact, I have been accessing many of those documents since the inception of 3GPP. It seems to me that the scope of 3GPP works is very big and it is not so easy to keep track for all of them for all those years with so many versions.
 
However, the access to the standardized documents is very limited. One can access only 3 times. More than this, the access is not provided unless one is the member of 3GPP.
 
That is OK for the closed forum like 3GPP that does not provide unlimited access like that of the IETF.
 
Recently, I proposed to contributors of closed forums (e.g., 3GPP) in NSIS WG as follows:
 
1. Any standard documents of the closed forums that cannot be accessed publicly and referred by authors to place in the website (preferably by the author or by liaison member) that can be accessed freely by IETF members.
 
2. Items that I mentioned in response to Dan's email.
 
Thanks for helping us to know about 3GPP/ETSI.
 
Best regards,
Radhika

I referred in my original mail to RFC 3113, which I assume you can gain access to without further subscription or payment.
 
This tells you exactly how you gain access to 3GPP documents, and that they are available to everybody with IP access.
 
Indeed if you look in the right place you can gain access to every version of every specification (bar about 3 on the security algorithms) that has existed electronically. Similarly you can also gain access to the vast majority of the internal working documents that have existed since 3GPP was created, if you really have the patience to work through them.
 
Obviously 3GPP specifications are published by the member SDOs, but as far as I understand, none of the publishing SDOs amend the contents of those 3GPP specifications from those appearing on the 3GPP site, and indeed the ETSI ones are also available free of charge for the minor pain of giving your name and email address before you obtain them.

OK, Good.
 
The question is this: Is 3GPP working for access agnostic specifications in the IETF?
 
If not, kindly summarize this to us as you seem to be working on behalf of 3GPP in coordination with 3GPP- IETF liaison as we are NOT aware of those 3GPP specs (unlike IETF, access to final specs are limited to 3GPP members only).
 
Best regards,

As part of its cooperation with ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP may place information in its specifications that enable reuse by other organisations, as well as those that are requirements for 3GPP operation.
 
Thus while the overall scope of 3GPP specifications will not change, you may find requirements in individual specifications that are not intended to be implemented by networks belonging to operators with GERAN or UTRAN attachments only. These requirements may be endorsed in the specifications of ETSI TISPAN, or other organisations.
 
Thus for example in 3GPP TR 24.819, you will find some proposed amendments to 3GPP TS 24.229 which specify attachment of terminals to an IMS through an XDSL system. These are still work in progress.
 
Finally note that most people in 3GPP participate in IETF as individuals and not as representatives of 3GPP, see RFC 3113. There is only one 3GPP liaison representative appointed by 3GPP TSG SA (along with IETF representation in the oppposite direction).

Just a quick clarification.  IMS is not just about wireless technology, even though it is primarily defined in 3GPP.  In 3GPP R6, IMS specs were altered to make them access agnostic and thus allow IMS to be utilised by any access (DSL, WLAN, FTTx) in such a way that an end user should receive common service and common touch and feel regardless of how they get to the IMS domain itself.

.......

[RRR] It seems to be confusing so far 3GPP works are conerned. The idea that 3GPP's IMS is propgating the following: The access is specific to cellular wireless, however, cellular wireless users need to have services that IMS is defining. So, IMS may have some aspects that may be used for other kinds of access technologies like Cable, DSL, Wireless LANs, FTTx, and others, but 3GPP has NEVER defined any criteria that it has NOW transformed itself to be access agnostic. 

[RRR] If 3GPP does so, it will be a mountain shfit for 3GPP in its charter, architecture, and requirements to propel in the IETF for SIP, SIPPING, AAA, and related WGs. In fact, in another thread in NSIS for a contribution on behalf of 3GPP, I mentioned that they should focus on access agnostic aspects of QOS in terms of mobility instead of just cellular wireless access.

[RRR] The question is this: Let us involve 3GPP as a whole to make clear (instead of individual contributions here and thers assuming that they do NOT respresent 3GPP) what is their actual motivation for providing contributions in IETF for creating standards? Is it only specific to cellular wireless access? Or, is it access agnostic?

	To: sip@ietf.org
	Cc: Wijnen, Bert (Bert); j.schoenwaelder@iu-bremen.de
	Subject: [Sip] draft-ietf-sip-mib-09.txt - 'MIB Doctor' review
=09
=09
	=20
	Here are my review comments. I apologize for the delay, but
unfortunately the document is not yet completely problems free, and it
generated some discussions 'in the doctors room':
	=20
	A few issues were found related to the definition of the
SipMethodIdentifier TC and its usage:
	=20
	1.  The way it is defined the TC encourages extensibility, and
this can be regarded as a good thing. In order to do this a vendor must
invent some numerical assignment, which is not yet used by the standard,
and the DESCRIPTION requires that this assignment "MUST ensure no
collision with officially assigned method identifier values" but says
nothing about how collision can be avoided.=20
	[klingle] one would avoid collision by checking the IANA
maintained list of latest officially assigned method id
	values... at least that was the intent/expectation.   if that is
sufficient, can we simply add that text?
	=20
	 It would be useful to split the identifiers numbers space into
standard and experimental, and create a second experimental registry
where vendors building an extension method and receive a number in the
experimental space.
=09
	[klingle] as long as the IANA administration of the second
registry isn't too much, this is a possibility.
	would you invision something like id values greater than 255
would be experimental space. =20
	that's an arbitrary demarcation based on the assumption that
there wouldn't be over 255 offical methods=20
	ever defined.   it would still be a vendor's responsibility to
avoid collision by getting an experimental number.
	i would expect the experimental number would forever be
allocated and not re-usuable.
	how much real new method creation is actually going to happen w/
SIP protocol?=20
	=20
	 This would ensure that collisions are avoided, and experimental
methods are identified at a glance.
	2. Another MIB Doctor asked 'why the method name has not been
used as an index as this would be the natural naming scheme. Having to
go through a lookup table (in case the SipMethodIdentifier has only
local significance) is painful and the alternative to establish another
IANA registry to number the SIP methods seems also kind of costly.'. I
am not sure that a change is necessary at this stage, as nothing is
broken, but as I would suggest that you provide a rationale for this
design choice.=20
	[klingle]  i think this was discussed at some point in the past.
the rationale i recall had to do with the ease of=20
	integral indexing in snmp tables vs. variable-length string
indexes.   keep in mind that the mib's generally a=20
	machine interface in that a NM application should be doing the
GETs and then has the opportunity to present=20
	the data in a more user-friendly fashion to a human being.  so
we thought the use of string methods indexing=20
	the tables everywhere was less efficient for the agent
implementations.
	=20
	3. The TC misses a DISPLAY-HINT (probably "d"), which results
into a smilint warning=20
	[klingle] ok.  will check on that.
	=20
	i will be on vacation next week and will try and address the
editorial comments below
	when i return.
	=20
	thanks for the review!
	kevin=20
	=20
	Some more editorial things.=20
	=20
	4. Since the document was published the Intellectual Property
boilerplates were updated. See
http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt for the latest version
	5. It is recommended that the module name of the SIP-TC module
be changed to SIP-TC-MIB
	6. typo - DESCRIPTION clause of SipStatusCodeNotifTable -
"seperate"
	7. typo - DESCRIPTION clause of SipMethodIdentifier -
"extention"
	8. typo - DESCRIPTION clause of sipServiceNotifEnable -
"approriate"
	9. type - DESCRIPTION clause of sipServiceWarmStart -
"adminstrative"
	10. There are 129 instances of too long lines in this documents.
Please run idnits for the full list
http://ietf.levkowetz.com/tools/idnits/idnits.pyht
	11. Warnings of weird spacing in lines=20
	tmp/draft-ietf-sip-mib-09.txt(4495): Line has weird spacing:
'...CodeIns   rena...'
	tmp/draft-ietf-sip-mib-09.txt(4496): Line has weird spacing:
'...odeOuts  renam...'
	tmp/draft-ietf-sip-mib-09.txt(4789): Line has weird spacing:
'...odTable  in th...'
	12. As Section 8 including the Log of Changes will be taken out,
but there are other sections after this section it would be better to
move it to an annex and renumber, making sure that proper references
from the text go to the intended place.
	=20

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Communications Resource Priority for the 
                          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: H. Schulzrinne, J. Polk
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-10.txt
	Pages		: 36
	Date		: 2005-7-15
	
This document defines two new SIP header fields for communicating
   resource priority, namely "Resource-Priority" and "Accept-Resource-
   Priority".  The "Resource-Priority" header field can influence the
   behavior of SIP user agents, such as telephone gateways and IP
   telephones, and SIP proxies.  It does not directly influence the
   forwarding behavior of IP routers.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-10.txt

To remove yourself from the I-D Announcement list, send a message to 
i-d-announce-request@ietf.org with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.  
You can also visit https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/I-D-announce 
to change your subscription settings.


Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-10.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-resource-priority-10.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Folks,

I've submitted an update to the target dialog header field spec. Until 
it appears in the archives, you can pick up a copy at:

http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-sip-target-dialog-01.txt

The changes from the previous version are:

* alignment with latest gruu best practices
* recommending target dialog with REFER, but not kpml; the previous spec 
had described its usage with kpml and dialog-event, but the latter two 
carry dialog info in the event header field, making it redundant. List 
discussion had concluded to limit usage of target-dialog to cases where 
it wasn't otherwise present
* updated call flows accordingly

There are no open issues that I am aware of, and I believe that the 
draft is ready for WGLC.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

As usual, I'll be collecting agenda requests and posting them on the 
softarmor site (http://www.softarmor.com/sipwg), so if you think you 
need a SIP agenda slot, please send me the request by Friday 8/22.

note that, as usual, we'll be trying to use meeting time to talk about 
"hard issues" that have been discussed but not resolved on-list, rather 
than presenting status or try and propose new work. So we may be unable 
to allocate time for presentations of new drafts that have not been 
discussed.

To make a request please send:

Topic of the discussion
Your name
Your email
The amount of time you think you need
A pointer or pointers to the relevant drafts(s)

To the extent possible, I'd like to get slides uploaded in advance of 
the meeting.

So, please plan to send slides ASAP after the agenda is posted, and 
certainly no later than the beginning of the meeting in which you'll be 
leading a discussion.

Dean

Ok, can we make it by 7/22? Aki seems to be feeling impatient.

Hi Juha,

this is a good point. My suggestion is that we remove the transport 
value for TLS over SCTP from the draft in AUTH48.

Thanks for the comment,

Gonzalo

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Suppression of Session Initiation Protocol 
                          REFER Method Implicit Subscription
	Author(s)	: O. Levin
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-02.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 2005-7-19
	
This specification defines a way to suppress an implicit subscription
   with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER method.  A new SIP
   option tag "norefersub" is defined to indicate support for this
   extension.  A new SIP header field "Refer-Sub" is defined to request
   the usage of this extension.

	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol Location Conveyance
	Author(s)	: J. Polk, B. Rosen
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-01.txt
	Pages		: 73
	Date		: 2005-7-19
	
This document presents the framework and requirements for usage of 
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to convey user location 
   information from one Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entity to 
   another SIP entity.  We consider cases where location information is
   conveyed from end to end, as well as cases where message routing by 
   intermediaries is influenced by the location of the session 
   initiator, the user agent client (UAC).  We offer a set of solutions
   to the requirements, each based on the scenario being addressed.

Guys,

The submitted draft is according to my best understanding of the
agreement from the last IETF and I am not aware of any open issues
associated with it.

That being said, in the process of writing this version, I came to think
that having a new general "Request-Options" or "Request" header
containing any defined option tags (and being positively responded by a
Require header) would be a better approach than having a specific
Refer-Sub header sent in both directions as in the current draft.

Any opinions?

Orit.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-target-dialog-01.txt
	Pages		: 16
	Date		: 2005-7-20
	
This specification defines the Target-Dialog header field for the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the corresponding option tag,
   tdialog.  This header field is used in requests that create SIP
   dialogs.  It indicates to the recipient that the sender is aware of
   an existing dialog with the recipient, either because the sender is
   on the other side of that dialog, or because it has access to the
   dialog identifiers.  The recipient can then authorize the request
   based on this awareness.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Author(s)	: R. Mahy
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-04.txt
	Pages		: 14
	Date		: 2005-7-20
	
When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a
   request, they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral
   port.  The SIP protocol includes mechanisms which insure that
   responses to a request, and new requests sent in the original
   direction reuse an existing connection.  However, new requests sent
   in the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing
   connection.  This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one
   connection for requests sent in each direction, and can result in
   potential scaling and performance problems.  This document proposes
   requirements and a mechanism which address this deficiency in
   environments where the connection could be opened in either
   direction.

To all,

Recently, there was a discussion of the question of whether or not the INFO 
can be sent before the dialog has been established. There seemed to be various 
opinions on this, but no clear answer. This is a very important issue for 
SIP-T.

As I noted before, INFO is defined in RFC 2976 where it states that it 
follows the rules for BYE as contained in RFC 2543. RFC 2543 is now obsolete. In 
fact, the main question about the use of INFO relates to its use during early 
dialog, a concept which was defined after INFO was defined.

RFC 3261 states that the BYE is used:
in the caller to callee direction, either in confirmed or early dialog state
in the callee to called direction, on confirmed dialog only

RFC 3398 indicates that the INFO is used to carry encapsulated ISUP:
in the caller to called direction, even if INVITE transaction is not finished 
(i.e., in both early and confirmed dialog state)
in the callee to caller direction,  even before answer (i.e., in both early 
and confirmed dialog states)

So, the use of INFO in RFC 3398 does not always follow the rules for BYE as 
stated in RFC 2976.

Q.1912.5, on the other hand, describes how "transparent" messages are 
encapsulated, and it says they are carried in the following:
a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the I-IWU in 
the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.
b) INFO message in all other cases. 

So the ITU-T Recommendation does have the INFO following the rules for BYE.

Is this a correct interpretation?

 SIP-T.<BR>
<BR>
As I noted before, INFO is defined in RFC 2976 where it states that it follo=
ws the rules for BYE as contained in RFC 2543. RFC 2543 is now obsolete. In=20=
fact, the main question about the use of INFO relates to its use during earl=
y dialog, a concept which was defined after INFO was defined.<BR>
<BR>
RFC 3261 states that the BYE is used:<BR>
in the caller to callee direction, either in confirmed or early dialog state=
<BR>
in the callee to called direction, on confirmed dialog only<BR>
<BR>
RFC 3398 indicates that the INFO is used to carry encapsulated ISUP:<BR>
in the caller to called direction, even if INVITE transaction is not finishe=
d (i.e., in both early and confirmed dialog state)<BR>
in the callee to caller direction,&nbsp; even before answer (i.e., in both e=
arly and confirmed dialog states)<BR>
<BR>
So, the use of INFO in RFC 3398 does not always follow the rules for BYE as=20=
stated in RFC 2976.<BR>
<BR>
Q.1912.5, on the other hand, describes how "transparent" messages are encaps=

a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the I-IWU in=
 the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.<BR>
b) INFO message in all other cases. <BR>
<BR>
So the ITU-T Recommendation does have the INFO following the rules for BYE.<=

Mike,
I do not agree with your interpretation of Q.1912.5.  Within RFC 3261 and RFC 3262, a dialog may be established by sending a reliable provisional or final response.  Q.1912.5 simply says that if you haven't sent a reliable response yet (provisional or final, to establish a dialog), encapsulate a transparent backward ISUP message in a provisional.  Your interpretation is correct without 100rel, but breaks down when using 100rel.  So according to Q.1912.5, any transparent encapsulated ISUP in the backward direction after transmission of a reliable provisional response will use INFO, including during the period before transmission of the 200 OK response.  Note that other (not transparent) ISUP messages follow different rules in Q.1912.5.
 
Regarding the supposed constraints on the use of INFO, RFC 2976 says the following things:
 
   It is necessary that the mid-session signaling information traverse
   the post session setup SIP signaling path.  This is the path taken by
   SIP re-INVITEs, BYEs and other SIP requests that are tied to an
   individual session.  This allows SIP proxy servers to receive, and
   potentially act on, the mid-session signaling information.


In RFC 3261 and RFC 3262, this requirement is also satisfied when a dialog is established using a reliable provisional response in support of, for example, the UPDATE request.  RFC 2976 goes on to say:

 

      Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the INFO request
      governing the usage of tags, Route and Record-Route,
      retransmission and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message
      formatting follow those in [1] as defined for the BYE request.


Reference [1] is RFC 2543.  This text only discusses the rules for formatting various header.  It does not constrain INFO to all aspects of the use of BYE.  And that's all that's said about the relationship of INFO to BYE at user agents.

 

The real problem is that RFC 2976 has not been updated to match RFC 3261 and RFC 3262.  But the intent of the original RFC seems clear enough to allow INFO in either direction once a dialog is established, such as by sending a reliable provisional response.  I see no problem with either RFC 3398 or Q.1912.5 in their use of INFO.

To all,

Recently, there was a discussion of the question of whether or not the INFO can be sent before the dialog has been established. There seemed to be various opinions on this, but no clear answer. This is a very important issue for SIP-T.

As I noted before, INFO is defined in RFC 2976 where it states that it follows the rules for BYE as contained in RFC 2543. RFC 2543 is now obsolete. In fact, the main question about the use of INFO relates to its use during early dialog, a concept which was defined after INFO was defined.

RFC 3261 states that the BYE is used:
in the caller to callee direction, either in confirmed or early dialog state
in the callee to called direction, on confirmed dialog only

RFC 3398 indicates that the INFO is used to carry encapsulated ISUP:
in the caller to called direction, even if INVITE transaction is not finished (i.e., in both early and confirmed dialog state)
in the callee to caller direction,  even before answer (i.e., in both early and confirmed dialog states)

So, the use of INFO in RFC 3398 does not always follow the rules for BYE as stated in RFC 2976.

Q.1912.5, on the other hand, describes how "transparent" messages are encapsulated, and it says they are carried in the following:
a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the I-IWU in the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.
b) INFO message in all other cases. 

So the ITU-T Recommendation does have the INFO following the rules for BYE.

Is this a correct interpretation?

SIP WG

I have updated the SIP Location Conveyance ID at the following link:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance-01.txt

There are many changes to this version from the previous (1 month old) version.

Here is a short list of those changes:

- rewrote/rearranged much of the middle of the doc,
- adding Reqs that have been brought to my attention,
- adding a new header to solve many scenarios presented - needing a solution,
- bringing up the 424 and 425 Response code sections to the beginning of 
the solution portion of the ID for clarity,
- moving most of the XML portions of the message flows back to 10 
incomplete appendixes.
- I also give two examples of the same position on the earth (my house) in 
geo and civic to show the PIDF-LO (between the status lines only).
- I spent a great deal of time walking the reader through expected 
behaviors of each SIP element in each scenario (this is the request, here 
is a viable 200 OK, now here are the alternative responses and what each 
significant header accomplishes - other than the Call-ID, CSeq, Via, and 
the other "normal" ones).

This new header is (surprisingly) called "Location" - with an admittedly 
incomplete ABNF (sorry). This header currently has many option-tags 
defined, some indicating what format the location is in from the message, 
others indicating what format is desired to receive back from the query for 
the UAC's location (see the new OPTIONS and SUB/NOT sections for this), one 
indicates location is in the message - even if a particular intermediary 
cannot decrypt it. A CID pointing at which message body is location is also 
possible now in a SIP Request, as well as allowing for location conveyance 
by-reference. This last new capability has limitations that are discussed, 
though I do not believe I have addressed yet all the limitations of this 
approach.

Comments to the SIP list are appreciated



cheers,
James

Hi, Mike,

=20

      I totally agree with your comments about=20

(1)INFO can be sent within dialog of cause at lease after early dialog =
is
established.

(2)transparent backward ISUP message may be encapsulated in reliable 1xx =
or
INFO.

=20

 But from the exact Q.1912.5 specification:=20

--Q.1912.5, on the other hand, describes how "transparent" messages are
encapsulated, and it says they are carried in the following:
--a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the =
I-IWU
in the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.
--b) INFO message in all other cases.=20

=20

It seems that backward ISUP message before call is connected must be =
carried
in 183 before a =93confirmed dialog=94,=20

I think this is the point which confuse some people who consider that =
INFO
in early dialog is another option.

Reguards!

Mike,

I do not agree with your interpretation of Q.1912.5.  Within RFC 3261 =
and
RFC 3262, a dialog may be established by sending a reliable provisional =
or
final response.  Q.1912.5 simply says that if you haven't sent a =
reliable
response yet (provisional or final, to establish a dialog), encapsulate =
a
transparent backward ISUP message in a provisional.  Your interpretation =
is
correct without 100rel, but breaks down when using 100rel.  So according =
to
Q.1912.5, any transparent encapsulated ISUP in the backward direction =
after
transmission of a reliable provisional response will use INFO, including
during the period before transmission of the 200 OK response.  Note that
other (not transparent) ISUP messages follow different rules in =
Q.1912.5.

=20

Regarding the supposed constraints on the use of INFO, RFC 2976 says the
following things:

=20

   It is necessary that the mid-session signaling information traverse
   the post session setup SIP signaling path.  This is the path taken by
   SIP re-INVITEs, BYEs and other SIP requests that are tied to an
   individual session.  This allows SIP proxy servers to receive, and
   potentially act on, the mid-session signaling information.

In RFC 3261 and RFC 3262, this requirement is also satisfied when a =
dialog
is established using a reliable provisional response in support of, for
example, the UPDATE request.  RFC 2976 goes on to say:

=20

      Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the INFO request
      governing the usage of tags, Route and Record-Route,
      retransmission and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message
      formatting follow those in [1] as defined for the BYE request.

Reference [1] is RFC 2543.  This text only discusses the rules for
formatting various header.  It does not constrain INFO to all aspects of =
the
use of BYE.  And that's all that's said about the relationship of INFO =
to
BYE at user agents.

=20

The real problem is that RFC 2976 has not been updated to match RFC 3261 =
and
RFC 3262.  But the intent of the original RFC seems clear enough to =
allow
INFO in either direction once a dialog is established, such as by =
sending a
reliable provisional response.  I see no problem with either RFC 3398 or
Q.1912.5 in their use of INFO.

=20

Subject: Re: [Sip] INFO method used for ISUP to SIP IW (2nd round)

To all,

Recently, there was a discussion of the question of whether or not the =
INFO
can be sent before the dialog has been established. There seemed to be
various opinions on this, but no clear answer. This is a very important
issue for SIP-T.

As I noted before, INFO is defined in RFC 2976 where it states that it
follows the rules for BYE as contained in RFC 2543. RFC 2543 is now
obsolete. In fact, the main question about the use of INFO relates to =
its
use during early dialog, a concept which was defined after INFO was =
defined.

RFC 3261 states that the BYE is used:
in the caller to callee direction, either in confirmed or early dialog =
state
in the callee to called direction, on confirmed dialog only

RFC 3398 indicates that the INFO is used to carry encapsulated ISUP:
in the caller to called direction, even if INVITE transaction is not
finished (i.e., in both early and confirmed dialog state)
in the callee to caller direction,  even before answer (i.e., in both =
early
and confirmed dialog states)

So, the use of INFO in RFC 3398 does not always follow the rules for BYE =
as
stated in RFC 2976.

Q.1912.5, on the other hand, describes how "transparent" messages are
encapsulated, and it says they are carried in the following:
a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the =
I-IWU in
the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.
b) INFO message in all other cases.=20

So the ITU-T Recommendation does have the INFO following the rules for =
BYE.

Is this a correct interpretation?

Recently, there was a discussion of the question of whether or not the =
INFO can
be sent before the dialog has been established. There seemed to be =
various
opinions on this, but no clear answer. This is a very important issue =
for
SIP-T.<br>
<br>
As I noted before, INFO is defined in RFC 2976 where it states that it =
follows
the rules for BYE as contained in RFC 2543. RFC 2543 is now obsolete. In =
fact,
the main question about the use of INFO relates to its use during early =
dialog,
a concept which was defined after INFO was defined.<br>
<br>
RFC 3261 states that the BYE is used:<br>
in the caller to callee direction, either in confirmed or early dialog =
state<br>
in the callee to called direction, on confirmed dialog only<br>
<br>
RFC 3398 indicates that the INFO is used to carry encapsulated ISUP:<br>
in the caller to called direction, even if INVITE transaction is not =
finished
(i.e., in both early and confirmed dialog state)<br>
in the callee to caller direction,&nbsp; even before answer (i.e., in =
both
early and confirmed dialog states)<br>
<br>
So, the use of INFO in RFC 3398 does not always follow the rules for BYE =
as
stated in RFC 2976.<br>
<br>
Q.1912.5, on the other hand, describes how &quot;transparent&quot; =
messages are
encapsulated, and it says they are carried in the following:<br>
a) 183 Session Progress provisional response if this is sent by the =
I-IWU in
the backward direction before a confirmed dialog is established.<br>
b) INFO message in all other cases. <br>
<br>
So the ITU-T Recommendation does have the INFO following the rules for =
BYE.<br>
<br>
Is this a correct interpretation?<br>
<br>

Hi,=20

I am developing a server sip, and now I am studying this protocol. I have=
 a doubt about the parameter response in the field proxy authorization. W=
hat are the fields and the order that it are in the response ? I read som=
e RFCs but I believe that my case is so specific, because I test every or=
der that I see and I don=B4t find de correct result of a MD5. I don=B4t k=
now if I want concat other fields, basically is this:
A1:username:realm:password
A2:method:Digest-URI
response =3D MD5(MD5(A1):nonce:MD5(A2))
But I don=B4t find the correct Result. Have other field in this case ? Th=
e parameter Branch is necessary ?

Why was pgp authentication removed in rfc3261?  A note mentions "PGP
MIME" is more complete, but I can't find any other RFC with a
WWW-Authentication scheme for PGP.  What is the recommended way to
implement WWW-Authentication using PGP?

Thanks!

Jonathan,

Minor comments:

1. Section 3, item 2, "The user agent client believes that the request will
not be authorized by the user agent server unless the user agent client can
prove that it is aware of the dialog identifiers for some other dialog.
Call this dialog the target dialog."

Should we change "will not" to "might not"? Even if the UAC does not know
for certain, use of target-dialog should be applicable.

2. Section 3, examples of use cases in which conditions are not met. There
seems to be a cut-and-paste error in the second bullet - the dialog package
does not show key presses.

3. Typo "speific" after last bullet.

4. Section 4, penultimate paragraph: "and thus the authorization strength is
reduced to MAY". It is the strength of the requirement for authorization,
not the authorization strength, that is reduced. I would propose to say
instead "and thus authorization is optional".

John

Hello,

I'm taking a closer look to SIP extensions that keep track of call 
diversions. Both the History-Info and Diversion header seem to be valid 
candidates.
I found the following documents defining these extensions:
- history-info: draft-ietf-sip-history-info-06.txt, expires July 17th, 2005
- diversion: draft-levy-diversion-08.txt, expires February 25,2005
What is the current status of these extensions? Is there still being 
worked on, are there new drafts on the way?

kind regards,
Sigrid Thijs

draft-levy seems to be de-facto standard that many products have
implemented,

Sigrid,

Also check out the ECMA-360 standard at: 
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-360.htm. It 
describes ways of doing diversion.

Cheers,

Folks,

I've run into some issues recently in environments making use of the 
service-route header field (RFC3608). In particular, there are now many 
sources that can be used to construct the route header field that a UA 
uses in a request:

* record-routes
* service-route
* 305 Use Proxy
* configuration, either through DHCP or the config framework

It was unclear how these various sources are reconciled to provide the 
final set, and which messages that set actually applies to (i.e., does 
it get used in REGISTER?).

I've written up an I-D that tries to summarize the issue and proposes 
some clarifications:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-route-construct-00.txt

Comments and questions welcome.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

Folks,

Jon, Cullen and I wrote up an I-D that talks about the issues of privacy 
in draft-ietf-sip-identity. The draft can be found here:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-identity-privacy-00.txt

As it turns out, rfc3323 (the privacy header field), has numerous 
problems when applied to draft-ietf-sip-identity:

   Intra-Domain Privacy: Because the SIP identity mechanism relies on
       the domain of the From header field as a key for obtaining
       certificates used to validate the identity in the From header
       field, anonymity is restricted to being within a domain.  It is no
       longer possible, as described in RFC 3323, to populate the From
       header field with "anonymous.invalid" as the domain.  As a
       consequence, a recipient of the request will be able to determine
       the domain of the originator of the request, though they will not
       be able to determine which user within that domain sent the
       request.  This limitation is not very troubling for domains with
       extremely large numbers of users.  However, for small domains,
       such as enterprises or home networks, it can be equally revealing
       as the identity of the requestor themselves.

    Contact Privacy lost: Because the SIP identity mechanism relies on a
       signature over the Contact header field for referential integrity,
       a privacy service that provides header privacy cannot actually
       modify the Contact value.  This will reveal the IP address of the
       requestor to the recipient of the request, which can often provide
       substantial information about the requestor.

    Session Privacy lost: Session privacy is accomplished through a back-
       to-back user agent (b2bua) that rewrites the SDP to relay session
       media through an intermediary.  This no longer works at all with
       the SIP identity mechanism, as it relies on a signature over the
       body of the request (which contains the SDP) to provide
       referential integrity.

    Subscriber Identity Lost within Originating Domain: One of the
       benefits of the P-Asserted-ID header field when used in
       conjunction with the "id" level of privacy is that elements within
       the domain of the originator of the request will still be able to
       determine the identity of the originator.  This is necessary for
       providing features for the requestor, accounting for their usage,
       and so on.  With the SIP identity mechanism, if privacy is needed,
       the From header field contains an anonymous URI.  As a result, the
       request has no information that can identity the user within their
       own domain, unless the SIP identity mechanism is used in
       conjunction with RFC3325, which is redundant.

    These problems are in addition to the problems inherent in RFC 3323
    to begin with:

    Sensitivity to Boundary Configuration: Although RFC3323 argues
       strongly in favor of placing the privacy service very near the
       originator of the request, this goal is at odds with RFC 3325,
       which requires the privacy service to be on the egress edge of the
       trust domain.  As a result, privacy is actually provided only if
       every egress proxy is properly configured to take positive action
       and remove the P-Asserted-ID header field.  Because positive
       action from the network is required to provide privacy, this
       mechanism is sensitive to misconfiguration of network elements,
       particularly in large interconnected trust domains.

    Complicated Call Trace: In many networks, there is a requirement to
       provide a call trace feature that allows for malicious callers to
       be traced back to their source so that legal action can be taken.
       The utility of such features in a global SIP network aside, RFC
       3323 makes such a feature difficult to provide since the identity
       of the requestor is literally removed from the request.  This
       complicates the tracking procedures needed to identify the
       originator later on.

    Limited Flexibility The degrees of privacy that RFC 3323 could
       provide were coded into the tokens valid in the Privacy header
       field.  More complicated combinations - anonymity for certain
       media streams but not others, for example - were not possible.


The draft proposes a mechanism to fix these problems. This mechanism 
would allow rfc3323 to be deprecated.

Comments or questions?

Orit has raised a what I think is a reasonable question on this draft.  
However, we had a strong consensus on the design team during the last  
meeting to proceed with the approach she has documented in the current  
version of the draft.

It seems to me that if we are going to proceed with the refer-features  
model, we might wish to do norefersub using this approach. If not, then  
we should clearly proceed with the current consensus.

So I'd like to raise two questions at this time:

1) Do we wish to proceed with a refer feature parameterization method,  
as in:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-refer-feature-param 
-00.txt?


2) Do we wish to reopen draft-ietf-sip-refer-with-norefersub-02.txt, or  
submit it immediately for publication as documented according to the  
standing WG consensus?

Thanks.

We've looked a couple of times at:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jennings-sip-sec-flows-03.txt

and said it was useful and needed to be done.

But Cullen tells me that he's just not getting any feedback on it, and 
that there may not be any point in talking about it any more at SIP:

So I'd like to ask the WG:


1) Do you want to see this published as a WG item and will you support 
this work by publicly committing the 100 or so hours needed for each of 
several reviewers to finalize the document?

2) Would we rather see Cullen publish this as an individual effort, and 
perhaps refine it successively in the future?

3) Should we give the problem up as too difficult or not interesting at 
this time, thank Cullen for all his hard work, and suggest he work on 
other more fruitful topics?


Thanks,

--
Dean

Jonathan,
	I have the following question/clarification.

1)In section 5.3 there is a sentence regarding 305 response handling
processing.

It says "This processing
   applies to requests both inside and outside of a dialog, and applies
   to all request methods, including REGISTER, with the exception of ACK
   and CANCEL."

Need clarification.=20
How long shld a contact returned in 305 response be treated as valid. Is
it temporary or shld be based on expires header. "If the above sentence
meant that subsequent requests (all) shld be sent thru the contact
received in 305.=20
Or
Does this sentence mean that mid-call dialogs also may result in 305. Is
this the case? For example a Re-Invite may result in 305? So that
subsequent requests for that call are sent thru a different proxy.

2) with regard to section 5.3 (and related to section 6) for backward
compatibility.

 UAC pre-populates Route headers A, B, C and D in the initial Invite
towards UAS  Proxy D decides to send a 305 with Proxy E's  Contact.
Proxies C,B do not handle the 305 and relay it back towards Proxy A.
Then Proxy A while construction the new Request will remove the Top most
route header which belongs to proxy B and replace it with the
Route-header corresponding to Proxy-E and send the Request towards Proxy
E. When Proxy E receives this Request it is going to POP route-header E
and send it towards C which in turn is going to send it towards D. D may
again send a 305 which C and E just relay it back towards A.

This may need protection in the proxies or UAC to make sure which entity
in the network is sending the 305 and in this case however the call is
not going to succeed at all because the route-header corresponding to D
is always there. So the requirement that the immediate preceding hop
shld handle the 305 is almost mandatory.

Say a UA A talks with UA B via B2BUA X. A wants to add an additional party, UA C to the call.
A wants to "ask" X to initiate the addition of C to the call. I can think of INFO or NOTIFY (w/ implicit subscription) sent from A to X as the simplest way to trigger the necessary action in X. It might be even the method MESSAGE with some text which is meaningful to X...

Is anyone aware of more "standardize" (but simple) way to accomplish that? In general I am asking about a SIP standardized way for a SIP element A to ask another SIP element B to perform an action, which is related to an existing dialog(s), without the need to use an additional protocol.

Thx

A sends an INV to C, sending the message at X (perhaps with a Route header 
of X). This might be the normal operation A, btw - based on a Service Route 
in the 200 OK Response to its REGISTER Request. Normally, X will forward 
the INV to C (being a B2BUA, this will look like X did this from C's pov).

The question you have to determine is where does the RTP go? In other 
words, what is the 3-way bridge element for these merged streams? A? or an 
external element like a DSP? It isn't going to be X.

If it's A, then there doesn't need to be anything special in the INV, and 
the SDP from A indicates A as the IP address for C's RTP stream to be set 
up to.

If it's a DSP, B needs to be reINVITEd to this DSP too.

Short: I (would) support it.

Long: As in my opinion the whole topic of secure call flows in SIP is far less 
understood by the majority of the implementors as the majority might think I 
(would) strongly support this document. At least at the last SIPit it was 
very valuable.
I assume the lack of feedback is caused by the fact that everybody just uses 
this document as a reference example to get their own implementations 
running. And the open questions are then direct against the documents which 
are defining the standards but not against this examples.

A focus is a standardized form of b2bua, and the conferencing framework 
provides several ways to ask the focus to add a participant. The 
SIP-based mechanism involves sending it a REFER. See 
draft-ietf-sipping-conferencing-framework and 
draft-ietf-sipping-cc-conferencing.

This, of course, requires that the focus be visible as a focus; i.e., 
its not a transparent b2bua that happens to have inserted itself on the 
call path. In those cases, it is nonsensical IMHO to ask it to do 
something for you, since you dont know its there.

Is there any standard/draft for interworking between MGCP and SIP?  I am 
specifically looking for how to map MGCP error messages e.g. NACK's to 
CRCX to  SIP error codes. Any pointers in this regards would be help.

Regards.

Not within the IETF. The PacketCable folks may have done some work in =
this area, but I don't recall ever seeing the mapping you ask about in =
their specs.=20

Keep in mind there are various ways to manage a "connection" in MGCP -- =
this will complicate your interworking task.  =20

Is there any standard/draft for interworking between MGCP and SIP?  I am =

specifically looking for how to map MGCP error messages e.g. NACK's to=20
CRCX to  SIP error codes. Any pointers in this regards would be help.

The short answer is that we removed it because it was unimplemented, 
incompletely specified, appeared to have no current constituency, and 
we didn't have time to deal with it in SIP.

There's a writeup on using PEM and PGP with Apache for authentication 
and encryption at:

http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/PEMPGP.html

that might have pointers that would help.


I don't believe we actually have "a recommended way" to do 
www-authenticate for SIP using PGP.

HI sir
=20
I am new to IP networks I want some clarification in RFC 791
=20
=20
Page 18 and 19
"Loose Source and Record Route"
=20
The paragraph in page 19 which states
=20
"If the address in destination address field has been reached and
the pointer is not greater than the length, the next address in
the source route replaces the address in the destination address
field, and the recorded route address replaces the source
address just used, and pointer is increased by four"
=20
I am not getting cleared with the concept of Source route and record
route what does the above statement means Can someone give an insight
into it with an example
=20
Thanks and Regards
Palavesam

There is no any standard as such, which addresses the SIP-MGCP 
interworking. Ususally this is a function of your application (e.g. 
MGC/IWF) to perform the interworking. However you can think of using either:

   1. Use the SIP Info method to carry the call related events.
   2. Use of Invite and its responses (180 and 200) to carry the SDP and
      Event related data.

The application of this two approaches is of course a topic for 
discussiion. We can get more inputs from the community.

Well, either you're on the wrong list, or you're looking at the wrong=20
RFC. While RFC 791 is conceptually similar to SIP routing, it's really=20=

about IP routing. That's at an entirely different ISO layer.

Classically, there is two ways to do route discovery ("search" and=20
"route knowledge"), and two different ways to do additional routing=20
after that discovery has completed ("source routing" and 'route=20
knowledge").

Consider a sequence:

           -----E
           |
U1---A----B----C----D----U2

where U1 wants to send a packet to U2.

U1 doesn't know anything about the network except that A exists and is=20=

a router, so U1 sends the packet to A.

A looks at the address of the destination, and either 1) asks its=20
neighbor B, who asks E and C, and C asks D, who knows (this is=20
"search"), or 2) calculates from its knowledge of the routing fabric=20
that B is closer to U2 than is A, so S sends the packet to B, who uses=20=

similar logic to forward along the chain to U2.

Now, for routing subsequent transactions. Basic IP routing just=20
continues to use knowledge in the router for forwarding future packets.=20=

It can do this because the routers are stateless with respect to the=20
dialog between U1 and U2 -- all the routers do is forward packets,=20
using rules and knowledge of the network topology. In the absence of=20
"record routing"(more below), stateless SIP proxies do the exact same=20
thing, but at the SIP layer ratehr than the IP layer.

Some protocols, like Token-Ring and SIP, report back the sequence of=20
routers to U1, so that when U1 sends a subsequent request, that request=20=

contains an explicit list of nodes to visit (in this case,=20
"A,B,C,D,U2").

SIP extends this a little bit by making it easy for nodes to "drop out"=20=

of subsequent requests. In fact, "dropping out" is the default --=20
unless a node adds itself to the Record-Route list, it will get dropped=20=

out.

So, let's say we're using SIP and only C record routes in the above.=20
This leaves UA knowing "C,U2" and subsequent requests in the same=20
dialog do not visit A, B, E, or D. They just go from UA to C to U2.

So, on to the text you're asking about -- the "length" bit is how that=20=

particular protocol tracks its route list. In SIP, we generally use a=20
grammatic mechanism -- the route-set is just an ordered list of URIs.

So in RFC 3261 "loose source routing", a proxy receiving a request=20
looks at the first Route entry. If the URI of that
entry belongs to the proxy, the proxy pops off the entry and forwards=20
the request on towards the next entry. If the URI does NOT belong to=20
the proxy, it forwards the request with the route unmodified, unless it=20=

has reason not to (local policy). There are some subtleties that apply=20=

to the unfortunately not-very-clever source routing mechanism of RFC=20
2543, which we still support for backward-compatibility reasons.

We all know that MIBs are a machine interface. We also know that lots of
people use generic MIB browsers short of a suitable machine interface.

The more important point I think is that the native identification of a
method is the method name. Introducing a new numeric numbering scheme
plus a mapping mechanism adds complexity and increases the potential to
get things wrong - I would be very careful in trading simplicity,
clarity and ease of use against agent implementation efficiency gains,
which clearly depend on the SNMP toolkit you use (and with many good
toolkits, there hardly would be a difference).

I'm pretty sure I have said all the things below on prevision version but
I'm sorry I forget the answers - might be nice if draft gave a hint to them.


Should be clear that this can only be used on mutual TLS connections that
are both originated from and sent to proxies with globally routable
addresses that are in DNS.

I'm not sure the alias tag buys much, perhaps you should just always do
this. In what cases would a proxy not want to insert the alias tag?

I'm not sure I see the point of the DNS verification step. It is going to be
significantly harder for an attacker to prove they have possession of the
private key for the domain than spoofing DNS. Agree doing both is harder
than just one but not really sure I see the value. Perhaps I am missing the
real purpose of the DNS verification. I also wonder about this facilitating
DDOS attacks on DNS servers but given that the attacker had to do a TLS
connection first I don't think this is a problem. That type of attack is
going to get much more interesting if DKIM happens.

Consider just a proxy making TLS connection *to* example.com. It does not
make a new session for every transaction. It does this by having a chance
and any time it tries to route to example.com, it looks in the cache to see
if it has a connection to example.com then uses it. Yes this breaks load
balancing across farms but the alternative of a connection per transaction
is way worse than breaking load balancing. So if you buys this so far, why
not when you receive a connection with a cert that says it is from
example.com, just insert this connection into the cache - regardless of
anything in the SIP messages. This has the advantage that it can all be
handled at the transport layer, you don't have to do  complex DNS queries to
authorize it.

Ignoring all that, I am worried that implementers will all just put alias in
stuff they send, no reason not to. Then when receiving alias, just blindly
add whatever is the advertised address with no verification. This will
result in trivial highjack of whole domains and the draft needs to make it
really clear how broken it will be if the verification is skipped.

Dean, first of all, I would like to point out the irony of you want my phone
to auto answer and you will not even include your phone number in the draft.
Just to prove you are too paranoid, I put my cell phone number and my email
address in all my recent drafts - contrary to urban legend, it did not
change my rate of spam or telemarketing in the slightest.

I'd like this better if it clearly diffracted between answer and receive
media and answer and send and receive. I will want different policy for the
two.

I would like it better if the UAS had an explicit consent mechanism to allow
the UAC to do this. (ala consent framework)

Seems like the alert mode could be a separate draft that might be better
bundled with the loop back stuff.

I think we need this auto answer stuff, we just need to figure out how to do
it such that it is possible to authorize it. (and this looks like reasonable
direction)

I find the x and xReq a bit weird and under motivated by we need all of them
but assume you will enlighten me on next rev.

Cullen

I like this and hope we can move forward with it. The lack of progress on
anyone securing REFER via the current mechanism is part of what makes me
believe in this.

I think your security section on randomness needs a little more. 3261 only
requires things to be pseudo random in that collisions are avoid. However,
it allows for things to be predictable such that if I see the state of
several of your request is a row, I may be able to guess the state of your
random number generator and predict the next one. What we need here is not
just pseudo random but crypto random. The to and from tags and probably
call-id need to not be predictable. Right now, most implementations I have
seen are using pseudo random (not crypto random) numbers for things like to
and from tags. If they support this mechanism, then they need to start using
crypto random. This may be a little hard for large GWs as they don't have
many sources of randomness (such as disk drives etc) and they have to
produce lots of these numbers. I think it should be possible given that they
do have lots of somewhat random network events.

If a UA only uses pseudo random, an attacker could send 100 calls to it,
look at the to tags, guess the state of the random number generator, then
try to "authorize" as the next logical call that comes to it.

Anyways, I think you should add into the security section that the right
things needs to be crypto random and what that means.

Cullen

Few comments about this draft...

I would change the feature tag from the name "privacy" to "viewers" (it
could still have the values of user, organization, public). Privacy refers
to another header in SIP that does not have much relation to what you are
doing here and this will confuse the issue greatly and cause this to get far
more security review than you wish it to get.

In section 6, you argue that recording is somehow different than say coping
the media onto a speaker - I don't really buy this - a caller might want a
call recorded or not. The recording is associated with an endpoint. I don't
buy some of the logic in here.

I'm not sure I understand how the SDP is going to work without multiple
rounds like preconditions work. Say and invite has an offer with nothing in
SDP. Then answer wants to request that the required viewer is user. How do
you do that? I think you can work this out but a bunch more is needed. Have
a look at the preconditions stuff.

I think you should address the problems with people just ignoring all this.
Say I had a phone that allowed me to set the "I am alone" flag so that even
when I was on speakerphone mode it would allow "user" level calls. I suspect
I would just set it to that and leave it there.

Hey, I only put my phone in the corporate directory under duress.

I couldn't change my rate of spam -- it currently approaches the link 
speed on my server. I'm either filtering or rejecting about 3,000 a day 
now. I get these HUGE sendmail log files on stuff it rejects because of 
spamhaus.org. Then SpamAssassin kicks in and picks out about another 
500 a day. But still, 50 or 60 get through.

Either I don't understand the question, or it's what I had in the first 
rev that Paul K made me change.

I suppose it could, but OMA needs something for POC last month.

X means "I want you to use this, but if you can't, do it normally" 
whereas XReq says "I want you to do this so much so that if you can't 
or don't want to, I'd rather you rejected the call."

This answeralert stuff is quite useful.

The document talks about it's applicability to Push-to-talk.

I would also like to see a mention of it's usefulness for other
features.

In particular, you can use it for Intercom call features (like on
any traditional PBX).

Also, it would be extremely useful to allow the answer-mode to be=20
allowed in an UPDATE (and re-INVITE). That would enable many features
that are available today on traditional PBXs (secretary override, and
other fun stuff difficult to do today).=20

Ok, makes sense when I think about it that way.

It doesn't. I'm merely pointing out that problem.

Not sure I follow here; I think there is a reasonable definition of an 
anonymous request with source authentication.

If each b2bua rewrites the From and re-signs, we basically have a 
solution with equivalent security properties to P-Asserted-ID. However, 
in more thoroughly connected networks, those properties have significant 
problems as I mention in the draft.

Cullen,

thanks for the helpful comments. Some responses inline.

Good suggestion, although 'viewer' does imply something about video.

We were motivated by the legal distinction between real-time listening 
and recording. I believe many jurisdictions restrict recording in 
various ways (e.g., requiring mutual consent or mandating "beep" or 
"this call may be recorded for quality assurance" indications), while 
speaker phones are not subject to such restrictions. I think this makes 
some sense - a permanent record has different privacy implications than 
human overhearing.

This definitely needs more work; we discussed preconditions internally, 
but didn't quite get this done in time.

This indeed relies on cooperation of end users, similar to other 
indications such as the GEOPRIV handling indications. It makes it easy 
to do the right thing and, somewhat more strongly, may encourage 
compliance since it creates an electronic record of my wishes, rather 
than a "he said - she said" situation.

More grist for the security considerations section...

Passing assertion and artifacts optimize different things. I completely
agree with the draft and we need to be able to do both. The biggest problem
seem to be how to bind this to the rest of the SIP message. Let me split
this into three cases

1) End to end
2) End to middle
3) middle to middle or end

In case 1, end to end, one way the binding can be done using the Identity
mechanism and putting the assertion or artifact in the body. The Identity
provides integrity binding to these rest of the message.

Case 2 is like case 1 but you might want a header like the end to middle
work has defined so that all the middles do not need to read all the bodies.


Case 3 seems like an age old discussion on having proxies add bodies. We
have never really figured out how to solve it. At first glance it seems like
just adding artifacts in headers might solve this case but it still runs
into the problems with binding and understanding tampering and cut and
paste. All seems hard yet many of the use cases could be solved with just
case 1 or perhaps 2.

Perhaps we should proceed with figuring out case 1 without yet having a
solution for 3.

A few comments on this. I'm not sure if these have been discussed 
before; sorry if they have.

I'm not sure its such a good idea to reuse the 493 response code. Though 
it is true that the error here is that the request is undecipherable, 
the 493 response was defined in the context of it being undecipherable 
by the UAS, not an intermediate proxy. Indeed, the UAC behavior in the 
case where it is undecipherable for a UAS is different. There, the 
response body contains a public key that is supposed to be used, and the 
UAC re-encrypts with this public key as the only desired recipient. In 
the e2m case, the client keeps the original public key, but adds a new 
one to the set of recipients. This is a fundamentally different behavior 
IMHO.

I'm also a bit puzzled about why a target needs to be specified for the 
signatures. A signed body doesn't need to be targeted for a specific 
proxy; any proxy can verify the signature if it likes. Perhaps I am 
missing something...

Thanks,
Jonathan R.

This draft is much improved from the previous version. Its an essential 
part of the SIP nat traversal story so I am glad to see that. Comments 
below, with big issues first.


Bigger issues

* I still like STUN even over TCP. It has the advantage of generating a 
response, and allowing the client to correlate the response to the 
request. See more below.

* the idea of a firewall between EP and registrar is something I'd 
rather treat in Rohan's connect-reuse draft. Let this draft focus on the 
client to network connections.

* I find the overview of opreations confusing; it describes many 
different scenarios, and gives the impression that the draft is a 
hodgepodge of techniques. I would prefer to cast the overview and spec 
overall in terms of the most genreal case - multiple edge proxies and a 
separate registrar - and then treat other scenarios as a simplified case.

* There are definitely some terminology problems and inconsistencies 
around the terms connection, flow and binding.

> With connection
>    oriented transports such as TCP or TLS, the keep alive will detect
>    failure after a NAT reboot.  Connection oriented transport failures
>    are detected by having the UA periodically sends a CRLF over the
>    connection; if the connection has failed, a connection level error
>    will be reported to the UA. 

This is not always the case. I've run into deployments where the NATs 
simply dropped bindings on the floor, and then dropped any subsequent 
data packets without sending a reset or anything else. As such, these 
took a very long time to get detected as connection failures. Using a 
stun keepalive transaction over tcp allows these to be detected rapidly.

> A CRLF can be considered the beginning
>    of the next message that will be sent, and therefore this approach is
>    backwards compatible with the core SIP specification.

This is a non-issue. The client needs to know that the server is 
supporting this mechanism in the first place before doing anything. Its 
just like sigcomp; you need to know the server does it before you start. 
  The draft proposes the stun flag for that. What you really want is 
something like "connection-management=stun", where you can specify 
different connection management techniques. You'd use that even if this 
was going to be over tcp.

Another really important point - the presence of 
"connection-management=stun" or whatever in the route header field of 
the register also tells the proxy that the client is using the 
mechanisms in this spec. As such, the proxy knows that it can skip "bad 
things" that servers sometimes do (like be an SBC) to deal with clients 
behind nat. Thats another reason why you want this connection management 
flag there even in the tcp case.

* its not clear to me that the wait time in section 4.3 provides 
sufficient avalanche restart protection, especially in a major case like 
a metropolitan power outage. You're still goint to see a huge flood of 
initial registrations, since the spec tells clients not to delay their 
initial registrations when they power up.

> Any time the registrar checks if a new contact matches an
>    existing contact in the location database, it MUST also check and see
>    if both the instance-id and flow-id match.  If they do not match,
>    then the they are not the same contact.

also, need to discuss the case where the contact URI do match, but the 
instance-id and flow-id don't. In this case, they are NOT the same contact.

>> The two algorithm for edge proxies are nearly identical with the
>>    exception that one integrity protects the identifier so it can not be

gruu has the same issue, and I am becoming convinced the encryption 
doesnt help much.

The last sentence is true today, but who knows what the future brings. 
Generally, since RFC text is burned in stone, its better to avoid 
statements about current network deployment scenarios.

.. digest challenge over that TLS connection.

Since this spec applies to UDP also, I think you need to say here that 
"connection" doesnt just mean a tcp connection.


Generally, the introduction seems to dance around the main point, which 
should be stated bluntly I think: This specification allows SIP 
registrations to be used to register clients behind a NAT or firewall.

> flow: A Flow is a network protocol layer connection between two hosts
>       that is represented by the network address of both ends and the
>       protocol.  For TCP and UDP this would include the IP addresses and
>       ports of both ends and the protocol (TCP or UDP).  With TCP, a
>       flow would often have to one to one correspondence with a single

>    flow-id: This refers to the value of a new header parameter value for

>       registration gets a unique flow-id value.

One would think that a flow-id identifies a flow, but based on the above 
definitions it doesn't. The first definition implies that a flow is 
identified by its 5-tuple.

I think that there are really three things here. One is a "flow", which 
represents a logical association between a UA and a specific EP host it 
wishes to correspond with. A flow is identified by a flow ID. A flow 
manifests itself by a "connection", which is a TCP connection for TCP, 
and a 5-tuple for UDP. The main point is that, as clienc connections 
come and go, the connection IDs (the 5-tuples) change, but they are all 
the same flow and thus have the same flow ID.

reference GRUU

> The overall approach is fairly simple.  Each UA has a unique
>    instance-id that stays the same for this UA even if the UA reboots or

Sure. But here, I think you mean it can do so multiple times against the 
same AOR, for the purposes of HA.

> Each

>    that is different for each connection.

So, if I re-register on a new tcp connection (because my old one 
failed), this would seem to imply a new flow-id, but thats not what you 
want.

> UAs use a keep alive mechanism to keep their flow to the proxy or
>    registrar alive.  For TCP, TLS, and other connection oriented

I think you mean connection instead of flow as the last word here.

>  When a proxy goes to route a message to a UA for which it has a
>    binding, 

you have not yet defined or used the term "binding". Also in this 
sentence I think you are talking specifically about the registrar proxy.

> The flow-id parameter is used to allow the
>    registrar to detect and avoid using invalid contacts when a UA

reboots or reconnects since its old connection failed for some reason 
(like a nat reboot).

this is discussed more thoroughly in gruu now, not sure it is needed to 
replicate that text here

this isnt just something a proxy "could" do - its almost fundamental to 
the operation of this spec. The set of registrations with differing 
flows to the same isntance ID represent a logical bundle, of which the 
proxy only picks one when actually forwarding a request.

backwards compatibility is a red-herring; see above.

OPTIONS "significantly* increases the load.

these two sentences seem contradictory - its not a failure to form the 
connection, but you're supposed to retry the connection..

this all belongs in gruu if needed.

this time is way too long. Thing about existing IM clients like AIM. I 
find that AIM detects failed connections within about 30s, indicating a 
keepalive of around that amount of time. Remember, for the duration that 
a bad connection is not detected, there is a gap in availability for 
incoming calls. Rapid detection is essential.


> User Agents that form flows with datagram oriented protocols such as
>    UDP SHOULD check if the URI has the "stun" tag (defined in

you need to specify what URI you are talking about here.

how does one close a UDP flow?

> Any time a SIP message is sent and the proxy does not respond, this

no - it doesnt follow the procedures in 4.1 yet. It has to figure out if 
it needs to wait. Generally, whenever section 4.2 concludes that a 
connection failed, it should refer to 4.3 for determining when to 
re-establish it.

important to mention that this is to avoid avalanche restart

> wait-time = min( 1800, (30 * (2 ^ consecutive-failures)))

this formula doesn't have the base-time in it; 30s is hard-coded.

>   These three times SHOULD be configurable in the UA. 

not clear which three you mean. You should explicitly define three 
variables and use them in the equation above. Also, you should talk 
about why they would ever be changed (its based on server capacity).

you should discuss cases like sequential forking, which normally pick 
contacts in q-value order; it won't do that now, and would rather 
initially treat the ones with the same instance ID as a group and pick 
one of those.

I thought a flow was specific to a single AOR?

The thing thats MUST strength is record-routing so that mid-dialog 
requests go over the same flow. You can do that without using the same 
URI as in the Path.

what about the stun parameter (prefer connection-management or something 
similar, per above)

hmm, same thing here - I wonder if perhaps you are assuming that the 
addition of Refer-Sub makes this an "explicit" subscription? I take 
"explicit" to mean, through a SUBSCRIBE.

This grammar should follow the standards outlined in 
draft-ietf-sip-guidelines. The above grammar allows for the following:

Refer-Sub: trueHello

and I don't think you want that. I'd suggest:

Refer-Sub        =  "Refer-Sub" HCOLON refer-sub-value *(SEMI exten)
exten = generic-param

the wording here doesn't provide any strength about knowing whether the 
request will be forked. Is it SHOULD? MUST?

this isn't really likely to ever work, since there are just no practical

might be worth mentioning how the REFER-Issuer can know the 
capabilities. Main one is the presence of the option tag in the

Prescaps is the other.

this example message shows it being sent to sip:pc-b@example.com, which

the examples in draft-ietf-sip-gruu.

I don't think this really updates 3515, in the same way we've not 
characterized any of the SIP extensions as updating RFC 3261.

s/feature tags/feature parameters


Some other suggestions:

* I think there should be some text up front that describes the ways in 
which the refer-issuer knows the capabilities of the refer-target

* The security considerations section talks about including only useful 
feature parameters in the Refer-To; I think you need to spend some more 
time in the body of the document describing what this means, and how you 
figure out what is relevant

Actually, that is not true. Quoting RFC 3261:

    When a tag is generated by a UA for insertion into a request or
    response, it MUST be globally unique and cryptographically random
    with at least 32 bits of randomness.  A property of this selection

That said, I added some text to target-dialog emphasizing the importance 
of the cryptographic randomness, not just pseudorandom identifiers.

To be clear, when sips is used you can't observe them. But if you are a 
user of the system you can make/receive your own calls, and observe them 
by being a participant.

Hi,

Thank you for your close reading. Please see my comments inline.
I'll fix the typos you pointed out in the next version.

The reference, RFC2630, for S/MIME CMS EnvelopedData which covers CEK 
and KEK mechanisms has already included in the draft.

The SIP Identity mechanism provides the data integrity of the message 
body in addition to the authentication. I mentioned the SIP identity 
mechanism as one of mechanisms for data integrity.

I believe that the naming depends who has the initiative to request the 
use of the body. Although there is no way for a UA to confirm the 
proxy's compliance, from the SIP perspective, the initiaitve should 
reside on endpoints. Therefore, I believe, "Proxy-Required-Body" is 
prefered. 

This comment addresses a core issue of this mechanism. For e2m to 
function properly, end and middle both have to comply its execution. The 
"Proxy-Required" header was considered as one of the way to accomplish 
this, but it is only effective for the first proxy server. It can not be 
used for non-adjacent proxy server. 
I could think of proxy adding confirmation flag indicating its 
complicance. 

>Section 4

This is used for a proxy to express what is desired to inspect in the 
decrypted data.

Could you be more specific?

I will delete this text, because it is redundant to the statement in 
RFC3261 which defines a proxy server to ignore unsupported headers.

This could happen. But a proxy could enforce disclosure of the whole 
body in order to avoid such situation. I'll add some text to describe 
how this can be accomlished as follows:

"If the proxy server reuqires disclosre of the whole body, the Warning 
header is not included."

I'll fix this for ACK and PRACK.

The CEKReference is used for the CEK reuse mechanism that I mentioned in 
Section 5.1.

>Section 9

RFC2045. I'll add this in the references.

Interesting idea, and I have a few comments:

section 3.1 needs to number the requirements for clarity sake

section 3.1 seems to be saying that the UAC shouldn't trust the UAS (it 
just contacted with a Request message, BTW) until the UAC has confirmed the 
UAS is really the UAS it contacted.

Kinda a "before we can speak, I need to know you are you who you say you 
are without you speaking (because that would be an unchecked reply)."

seems like a bit of catch-22, or am I missing something?

In the example in section 3.1, why should Alice trust Proxy2? She has zero 
prior association with that proxy because all communication to Bob has gone 
through Proxy1, has it not?

 From how you've written this, if there are 10 proxies between proxy1 and 
proxy2, only proxy2 will send this responder verification 183 message, right?

Wanting to know if Alice is going to receive a 183 per SIP hop her Request 
traverses?

The 183 mentioned in secgtion 3.1 is absent from the flow example in 
section 3.2. Why?

The flow on page 7 should be labeled.

But, within that flow, say there are 10 SIP Hops between proxy1 and proxy2, 
is this ID suggesting there needs to be a SUB/NOT exchange between proxy1 
and proxy2 anyway? If so, how would proxy1 learn about proxy2?

What if there were/is a B2BUA in between proxy1 and proxy2?

This example message flow needs to address a more complex scenario or two 
to learn how this proposal reacts. May I suggest both:

alice <=> proxy1 <=> proxy3 <=> proxy4 <=> proxy2 <=> Bob

and

alice <=> proxy1 <=> proxy3 <=> b2bua1 <=> proxy4 <=> proxy2 <=> Bob

  to tease this proposal out?

The 3rd paragraph talks about a 180 being the first time Biloxi Proxy needs 
to do "real" work, and this 180 was left out of the section 3.2 example. Why?

Last paragraph on page 8
"UAC may receive the response code 431 Failed Responder Identity.  UAC 
should choose to avoid the verification of the responder identity. UAC 
should treat it as a failure and may terminate the dialog."

How is this done? With a normal ACK then a BYE? Wouldn't this give more 
information to this bad-guy proxy?

section 6.1 - the Responder header is to give the first hop proxy (in the 
response direction) the address of the responder, just like the To: field? 
Is this level of redundancy necessary since Bob MUST have a shared secret 
between his UA and the Biloxi proxy2 server (as stated previously)?

The Security Considerations section reads like a summary section advocating 
the doc, rather than a "if implemented badly, these are the bad results" 
type of text.




cheers,
James

Jonathan,

I agree. As you pointed out, the UAC is expected to react differently 
when receiving the 493 response code from the proxy. In addition, the 
error response doesn't include who the sender is,  so there is no way 
for the UAC to know whether it's the UAS or the proxy server. 
For the UAC to behave properly, we need a new error code (496 Proxy 
Undecipherable).

A motivation for this was the validation service at a specific proxy 
invocated by a UA, although any proxy on the signaling path can verify 
the signature. If there is no compelling usecase, we could drop this 
mechanism to simplify the mechanism. 

Thanks,

I had a long discussion with several TCP experts today and now fully
understand what is going on here. I agree and will recommend to the group
that we switch to STUN over TCP.

The case Dean wanted addressed was actually a NAT between the two proxies.
Dean, are you ok with just having Rohan's draft address this?

I'm trying to balance this off against most implementers, and I suspect a
large percentage of the WG is not familuar with the term edge proxy. But
agree with general comment and will try to refine this.

Agreed - need to fix. May ask you for a detail NITS review some time after

yes, will switch to STUN over TCP, sorry it took me so long to understand
why this was critical. I will do my best to explain to rest of WG why this
change is needed.

Cleary deployments may want to change these. I will try and put some text to
motivate these numbers. The number came very roughly from estimate of if
load caused by registration is same as invite (huge approximation) and
average non presence client does say peak hour calls of 2 bhca, then proxy
farm cpu to support 2 calls per hour per client. This would imply that it
had cpu power to do 2 registrations per hour per client implying that when
the clients were attempting to register at steady rate or 2 per hour (or 30
minutes) they would all register.

hash may be more appropriate than encryption but unless you are doing all
the edge proxy to reg either inside a walled garden, or over sips, it seems
like you need the integrity protection or an attacker can hijack calls.
