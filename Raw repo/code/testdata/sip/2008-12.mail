Correct. And why do something different when MESSAGE already does it
that way.

Correct

A 3xx to 6xx indicates failure to deliver the info package to the
application above.

The simplest error recovery case which seems to apply in existing usage
is no information is sent in the reverse direction regarding application
error handling, or it is handled as part of the application protocol,
i.e. there is a message embedded in the package which in any case
generates a response within the application.

I still want to see why we, if we are going to allow multiple body
parts, can't allow multiple info packages, but let's leave that for a
moment...

INFO, can all carry bodies and not one of

Yes. And, if we are going to use CID, it means yet another RFC to
support.

What's wrong with using Content-Disposition?

But, what if the information the piggy-backer wants to send also uses
info packages?

The answer is, yes if that is what the application demands.

I would note that on the analogue network DTMF is unacknowledged. The
only way I know that my digits have been sucessfully received is when
call control advances a state. I don't know it has missed a digit until
the wrong person answers the call, or I get number unobtainable. I have
to go to MFC to get any form of acknowledged tone signalling, and as yet
I have not seen INFOs carrying R2 signalling packages.

So in this case, a SIP state change could well be an implicit
acknowledgement generated by the application, but that is not one
implied by any response to the INFO request.

Correct. And I see even more problems if you try and do it at the SIP
level.

Well as I said before, not all info packages require a direct response.

Just because everyone else got it wrong does not mean we have to be  
wrong, too...

The problem is that none of them really considered the impact of 
multiple body parts, so it is anything but clear how an application is 
supposed to decipher one of these messages when it does contain multiple 
body parts. We are going to find that when combined with body parts for 
other purposes, implementations will do a variety of things. (That 
includes existing legal usages, such as body parts with C-D of "alert", 
which have been defined for a long time but never used.)

The body-handling draft tries to sort this out. But based on that we 
need to do better going forward than we did in the past.

Things were only "simple" in the past because we left things unspecified 
that needed to be specified.

You can have your "simple" solution here, analogous to the historic 
mechanism, by explicitly defining that body part(s?) with the 
content-disposition of "render" are to be considered to be the 
info-package payload. I say "render" because that is the *default* C-D, 
so it keeps things "simple" since it can be omitted. However you then 
should specify what happens if there are multiple body parts with C-D of 
"render". Also, you then need to specify whether a multipart body with a 
C-D of "render" should be viewed (in total) as the info-package payload, 
or whether some contained part of it should be the payload.

Personally, I would rather go with something less "simple" but more 
explicit here. Either a special C-D, or the CID reference.

> A "piggy-backer" is an extension to SIP that piggy-backs bodies onto any message method types.  Geolocation is an example of one.  Since it's the responsibility of the piggy-backer to handle identifying its specific body-part and dis-ambiguating it from the method's, we don't have to do anything.  In other words, Geolocation would already have to deal with current INFO message and body syntax.

(whether they should have done it in SIP vs. the media layer is orthogonal)  And let's suppose for whatever reason the SIP stack always adds Geolocation information of the UA's physical location.

Wrong because there is no explicit linking of a body part to what that  
body part belongs to.

Content-Disposition is absolutely the wrong thing.  The original  
Content-Disposition is about whether you wait for the whole message to  
arrive before rendering, and if you render the part where you find it  
or as an attachment.  SIP has bent this totally out of shape beyond  
recognition, almost to the point where it really is Message-Context.

Perhaps that is the answer?  Do-as-I-say (Message-Context), not Do-as- 
I-mean (Content-Disposition)?

I guess you are asserting the above, right?

Its possible that is what the original authors of INFO intended, though 
it isn't entirely clear to me if that is the case.

But the whole problem we have now is that INFO has evolved into 
something that may be different from what was originally intended. At 
this point we are trying to reverse engineer a better defined 
replacement to what INFO has become. If we don't accommodate the usage 
people need, then there will have been no point in doing it at all.

I honestly don't know at this point whether what you specify above is 
sufficient. At the very least, I think we need to *permit* the receiving 
application to signal a problem with the content of the package in the 
response to the info message. Perhaps we don't need to *require* that 
any problem with the content be signaled that way. However I do think it 
would be good to distinguish the case where the content is good from the 
case where the content hasn't yet been acted upon - probably using the 
200/202 response distinction that is used elsewhere.

And I do think we should at least specify how problems with the content 
may be reported in the info response - which error code(s) should be 
used. (For example, 415 has a very specific role here - if the C-T is 
incorrect for the package. But if the C-T is correct and:
(1) the content of the body part is inconsistent with the type
(2) the content of the body part is consistent with the type,
     but the content is semantically inappropriate
then the response to use is not clear. We could extend the definition of 
488 and/or 606 for this purpose, or we could pick something new. But we 
at least ought to make it clear what should be used for these cases.

Anders has argued for allowing content in the body of the INFO response 
to be significant. That is certainly a possibility, but I am not certain 
if the added complexity is justified. If so, then I think it should be 
the responsibility of the info package definition to specify which types 
go in requests, and which (if any) go in responses. But the info-package 
draft will still need to specify that this is legal, and how the body 
part carrying the response is indicated in the response message.

Beyond that, if there is a need for delayed responses I am fine with 
requiring that it be negotiated as distinct packages in each direction.

	Thanks,
	Paul

That's illogical, I think.  An "Info Package" is inexorably linked to an INFO message context use.  A piggy-backer could certainly use the same content-type, with even the same semantics as a package, but it's not an "Info-Package".

It's like asking if one can use a RFC 4235 Dialog Event Package with an INFO message.  The answer is no - Event Packages are tied to a Subscribe/Notify usage.  You could use an "application/dialog-info+xml" body in an INFO I suppose, but you're not actually using/doing the "Dialog Event Package", and you'd have to define an Info-Package for that body type with whatever semantics apply.

There are two aspects to this:
1) Legacy/deployed code.  There's a crapload of it out there, doing what sub/not/publish/message/info/etc. said to do.  That code is deployed - there is NOTHING we can define to change their behavior, because the code is what the code is.  So as I said before, we can't go turn back the clock.  Any piggy-backer that would create multiple body parts where none existed before has the responsibility to make itself work with that legacy code, not the other way around.  That's not a problem we can fix.

2) New INFO code.  I think we all agree that this draft must reference the body-handling draft as normative to support.  The next question is if the draft needs to make any other specific normative requirements for handling of anything other than what the body-handling draft says.  If it does, then I would assert such extra normative requirements are necessary for Subscribe/Notify/Message/etc. too, and thus deserve their own, separate draft that covers all of those message types, instead of one specific for INFO.  A separate draft like, oh... body-handling?  :)

And doing what it *thought* it should do in cases where the specs didn't 
say.

I suspect that the majority of the deployed code won't do anything good 
with multipart, though I see from the SIPit reports that support is 
getting there in things that are being brought to SIPit. (May not be the 
majority of what is deployed.)

> That code is deployed - there is NOTHING we can define to change their behavior, because the code is what the code is.  So as I said before, we can't go turn back the clock.  Any piggy-backer that would create multiple body parts where none existed before has the responsibility to make itself work with that legacy code, not the other way around.  That's not a problem we can fix.

The next question is if the draft needs to make any other specific normative requirements for handling of anything other than what the body-handling draft says.  If it does, then I would assert such extra normative requirements are necessary for Subscribe/Notify/Message/etc. too, and thus deserve their own, separate draft that covers all of those message types, instead of one specific for INFO.  A separate draft like, oh... body-handling?  :)

For use with info-packages, we still have to define how the info package 
body part is identified by the recipient. Simply saying that it should 
be done the same way that old INFO, NOTIFY, and MESSAGE do it, when that 
hasn't been well defined, isn't a sufficient solution.

The bottom line is that we have *nothing* that says "this is how you 
identify the body part(s) that are supposed to be processed based on the 
definition of the type of message that contains them". Yet that is what 
we need here. (And what we should have had for MESSAGE and NOTIFY as 
well, among others.)

There is also what should be done for new implementations of legacy 
INFO, and to upgrade existing implementations of the legacy INFO.

All the code has to continue supporting legacy INFO. Even after almost 
everybody has upgraded their code to support multipart, legacy INFO 
usage will almost certainly continue. So there can then be cases where 
legacy info use is combined with body parts used for other purposes. We 
should be clear how that should work. And it must be defined in such a 
way that interoperation with old implementations of INFO still works.

The mechanism used to identify the body part for legacy info *could* be 
entirely distinct from the mechanism used for identifying an 
info-package. But if a common mechanism works for both, that would be nice.

Since, as you said, legacy INFO (or legacy anything really) has basically undefined behavior for multiple body-parts, how can we reasonably define a mechanism that works for multiple body parts with legacy code?

I think the answer is: don't change it.  One way to not change it, as you've already pointed out in a previous email, is to simply say anything with a Content-Disposition of "render" is for the package, unless the package defines a specific Content-Disposition for itself. (as SIP-T/SIP-I does, for example)

This requires 2 things:
(1) that every B2BUA constantly be upgraded to handle whatever new mechanism's syntax is for the identifiers, every time a new one is defined. (e.g., new XML schema or new header)  I realize that's the nature of "you break it, you fix it", but if people want to have their new thing work without needing B2BUA's to be upgraded or re-configured, then there needs to be some generic way of handling this.
(2) that the mechanism using the call-id+tags gets sent to the B2BUA that changed them.  Often it will.  Sometimes it can't.  For example, the mediactrl-framework model.  Stick a b2bua between the UA and the Media-Control-Client, and the application doesn't work - or wouldn't have, except they changed it to use a new identifier different from call-id to avoid this problem.

Actually that's debatable.  I don't think we'd want to say B2BUA's MUST change the Call-ID.  3261 did say a B2BUA is the logical concatenation of a UAS and UAC, but clearly not much text in 3261 was given to how a B2BUA should operate.

Some folks (from 3gpp) have asked that B2BAU's not change the contact-uri if it's a GRUU, though I'm not exactly sure why.  There are also some cases in which having a B2BUA change the contact to be its specific instance doesn't work, because that address is not globally reachable; so leaving it as a GRUU (or something like a GRUU), is necessary but means out-of-dialog requests don't always reach the same B2BUA instance.  This has been found in REFER transfer cases, where the referred party can't reach the same B2BUA as the referrer can.

So... given that we already have a call-id that _should_ already have
all the matching properties you want if B2BUAs would just leave it alone
(changing tags as a message passes through a B2BUA should provide the
required dialog uniqueness while leaving the call-id to recognize the
relationships), what is wrong with just creating a new set of rules for
how to construct a call-id so that it has the other properties you
suggest? 

You could even add a magic cookie to the beginning as was done with Via
branch ids to declare that the call-id is a session-id that should be
preserved.  Then it's easy to detect who supports it and understands the
semantics.  

I don't think that reformulating call-id is any harder to deploy than a
new header would be.

To be clear... I'm very supportive of solving the problems that Hadriel
is pointing out.  For one thing, it would give us a good framework to
begin really classifying and recognizing the various sorts of
middleboxes we have that are not "pure" SIP proxies, and begin
describing what they can and cannot do.

So, maybe we should use Content-Type, then?

You missed an email explaining that: if we mandate not changing "safe" call-id values, all b2bua's along the path have to stop changing it, and the UAC has to create a "safe" one.  If we do a new header, only some b2bua's need to change for matching to work in most cases.  All of them would need to pass the header for it to work, but my assumption is that's more likely.  It may be a false assumption, but from the traces I get to see, it looks like new headers get through fairly often. (at least those without URI's)

I think I agree with Hadriel on this one :)

Legacy has issues, and people who want to continue using legacy will
have ways of dealing with that. The whole purpose of this work os not to
make legacy better, but to define something which solves the issues with
legacy - Info packages. 

Yes, our document is also supposed to cover legacy, but I don't think we
should specify anything more than what is in the current RFC today.

So, I think the question we shall focus on is: how do we identify that a
body part contains an Info package?

>I think the answer is: don't change it.  One way to not change it, as
you've already pointed out in a previous email, is to simply say
anything with a Content-Disposition of "render" is for the package,

(as SIP-T/SIP-I does, for example)

Each package can define what C-D value to use, but based on the
discussion I think that we will not use C-D to actually say "This body
part contains an info package".

Regards,

Christer

The implementations of DTMF-over-INFO I'm familiar with will respond 
with 4xx error codes to malformed payload. My guess is that's extremely 
common.  This is arguably a layer violation but, I think, a fairly 
benign one.

Either we allow error responses in such cases or else we say just don't 
return an error (which I think rather limits the scope of this work) or 
else we say the error indication needs to be sent in an INFO in the 
opposite direction. OR we allow INFO responses to carry an app-level 
response in the payload.

Do you see any problems in carrying an app-level payload in 200 
responses to INFO?

No but those that do will IMHO not be served well by the info framework 
as it stands.

A new version of I-D, draft-worley-references-01.txt has been successfuly submitted by Dale Worley and posted to the IETF repository.

Filename:        draft-worley-references
Revision:        01
Title:           The References Header for SIP
Creation_date:   2008-12-01
WG ID:           Independent Submission
Number_of_pages: 23

Abstract:
This document defines a SIP extension header, References, to be used
within SIP messages to signify that the message (and the dialog
containing it) is related to one or more other dialogs.  It is
expected to be used largely for diagnostic purposes.

Dale

What you are asking for is the UAS to keep state indefinitely on each  
200 OK, because the UAC may or may not be there to retransmit the  
first INFO request.  That does not sound like an ideal design.

I too am confused about what/whom you feel is wrong.

Is it that you're unhappy that INVITE, ACK, PRACK, UPDATE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, PUBLISH, MESSAGE, REGISTER and INFO methods can have multiple body parts and there's no clear distinction of which body part applies to the method's context action/purpose?

ISTM somewhat silly to go and fix this for new uses of INFO.  It's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  The ship was built to gracefully handle a few holes from usual wear-tear, and you want it to survive a whole iceberg (multiple bodies).  It would be nice to make the boat stronger (ie, change all the RFCs to have body-part contexts), but that ship has already sailed. (oooh, a metaphoric double entendre)

Imagine if we were talking about updating the HTTP POST method for some reason, and while we were doing it we realized some body-parts may not be for the POST context, but could instead be in any HTTP method - like a Geo-Loc body-part for example.
Would we:
(a) Change how POST is formatted, to uniquely identify the mime parts that *are* for POST operation, and only for POST, or
(b) Make the body parts that were *not* part of the POST context uniquely identify themselves as *not* being part of it, no matter the method?

Methinks (b).  (b) is accomplished by having the body-part that is NOT for the INFO package identify itself using a Content-Disposition of "by-reference".

Umm, wouldn't it only keep it for the duration of a transaction lifetime, which is the same as it would have to do if it were to send it in an upstream INFO request?

PUBLISH, for example, does this doesn't it?  You don't respond to a PUBLISH until you've fully processed the publish request, including all Event Package body content. (and both request and response can have bodies for their event package)

Yes, the UAS only needs to keep transaction state for some bounded 
period of time as defined by the RFC 3261 non-INVITE server transaction FSM.

Maybe Eric has in mind a UAS that responds to INFOs statelessly as per 
3261 sec 8.2.7. I really don't think we need to worry about making that 
kind of optimization impossible.

Hadriel has a point here.

We know that EVERY SIP usage where we end up with two or more
attachments is going to have the attachment-selection problem, aka
"which attachment goes with which extension?"

This isn't just a problem for new work; it's potentially a problem for
several old or ongoing bits of work that result in the potential for
multiple attachments.

Perhaps we should solve this universally in the body handling draft?

don't we have a SIP error code for "body not understood"?

I'd really like to NOT design every possible application's state into
SIP. Otherwise, we'll end up with error codes for "no, I want a blue one!"

Use a transaction-correlation ID in your application-level protocol
(i.e, in the package specification) if you need this sort of function.
It's not SIP's problem.

No, I think this means we messed up every one of those methods when we
didn't address the multiple-body problem earlier. The reason it isn't
exploding yet is that the specifications are ahead of the
implementations; when the implementations catch up with the broken
specs, we'll have failures of biblical proportion.

Sometimes we can demux on body-type. This is obviously not a universal
solution. We really need a generic solution that works for all methods,
not just INFO.

Unfortunately we don't quite have that, though we have something close:

488 / 606 apply to the body, and have the names Not Acceptable Here / 
Not Acceptable which sound about right. But the description says:
    some aspects of the session description such as the requested media,
    bandwidth, or addressing style were not acceptable.
which really only applies to SDP (-: or SDPng :-).

415 works when the Content-Type itself is not supported, but not for the 
other cases.

I'm inclined to stretch the definition of 488/606 to cover arbitrary 
bodies. Or we could define a new code that has the more generic meaning.

That is the problem with 488 as it stands.

That was my knee-jerk reaction, until I realized that EVERY method  
needs to address the issue. All body-handling can do is give guidance.

One approach is to bastardize Content-Disposition to mean Body-Part- 
Context, in the vein of Message-Context for e-mail (RFC 3458).  Body- 
handling would specify generic SIP stacks to be aware that Content- 
Disposition is how you pair a body part with its intended use. Hope no  
one else wants Content-Disposition: render for anything else...

Another approach is to mandate Content-ID, and give guidance to  
writers of extensions that add body parts to explicitly state how to  
address the relevant body part.

So, one thing is clear: we really screwed up by trying to hack Message- 
Context into Content-Disposition.  Mea Culpa for not noticing it sooner.

I believe that's what we meant :-)

If a UAS doesn't understand the body of an INFO, it presumably sends a
415 (like it would for any other required body part it doesn't understand).

I quote from RFC 2976:

      If the INFO request contains a body that the server does not
      understand then, in the absence of INFO associated processing
      rules for the body, the server MUST respond with a 415 Unsupported
      Media Type message.

This is significant for choosing which of several alternative body types
might be supported for a given package.

If the "not understood" is at the level of the application state, fixing
that is an application problem, not a problem for the SIP protocol. Fix
it in the package, not the transport.

Exactly.

Regardless of whether Eric thinks it was appropriate or not, 
Content-Disposition was recruited for this purpose in 3261 via its use 
for "session", "alert", and "icon". And it has been used in a few other 
RFCs in a similar fashion.

For lack of anything better, to remain backward compatible, we probably 
need to consider C-D of "render" as identifying the principal body part 
used by MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, PUBLISH, and presumably *legacy* 
INFO. That works in the case where there is no multipart.

When you introduce multipart to any of those, unless you are careful to 
put some other C-D on the multipart itself, it becomes ambiguous whether 
the multipart as a whole is the principle body for the method, or if it 
should be opened and a part within it sought, because the default 
disposition for the multipart will be "render". We could probably fix 
this by having a special rule for multipart/mixed with "render".

	Thanks,
	Paul

By detecting the legacy code using a Require option-tag, and failing the
call.

Seriously.

For a very reasonable definition of backward-compatible, that's a
backward-compatible mechanism -- it behaves predictably in the presence
of broken old crap. We can't fix the broken old crap. All we can do is
detect its presence, and work within its limitations if required.

I don't think I'm trying to make it "SIP's problem".

I'm arguing that if a response is needed it's much simpler and just all 
around better to do the response-to-request correlation by sending the 
app-level response in the 200 response to INFO as opposed to sending it 
in a separate INFO going in the opposite direction. It doesn't violate 
layering and I haven't heard of any real problem with it.

It means that the stack can't send a 200 response to INFO until it has
been directed to by the application. That seems like a layering problem
to me, not to mention a major stack rewrite.

Right, I'm sure that's a total stack rewrite. It's a wonder how people 
manage to send DTMF in INFO today. With app-generated error codes.

Ya know, I would have thought so too.  But then I checked out PUBLISH.  It does exactly that: no response until you've fully processed the event package.  Strange.

I don't think he means it would be a stack re-write for you (or most people using info-dtmf or that matter).  He just means that as it stands right now per the INFO RFC, one could build a SIP Stack that uses INFO in a completely layered approach.  It would interoperate with an integrated stack for info-dtmf, because DTMF as an application doesn't really care about failed remote processing, so neither side would care and they'd both interoperate.  And for info-dtmf there is no application data returned on error, afaik.

Why don't we just compromise and do what other similar methods do: let the base draft say the package decides its own needs, but that it is RECOMMENDED to handle application-level errors in a separate transaction?  This still provides interoperability, because we negotiate supported packages to begin with and if you don't want to support a direct response you don't have to support that package; and if we find packages that really need/benefit from a direct response, they can argue their case.

BTW, when we talk about application-layer error, I hope we're not talking about content errors like XML formatting errors.  Because a Firewall could process that and decide to reject malformed XML, and the Firewall will have no application-layer for the package.
Even in a "layered" approach, delivery failure due to a 400 response is still sent up to the application caller I assume?

I am considering contacting the authorities to come find you.  Because you have either gone insane, or your email client has been hijacked. :)
Seriously - you expect us to put in a Require header option-tag when multi-part mime is used, so it can fail against every SIP device that is deployed on the planet??

At that point, I suggest you just change the SIP version number to a new value instead.

yes, your understanding is correct. Those are the typical situations 
where you would want to mark your mixed container as required.

Hi Eric,

if you think the body handling draft needs to give guidance on this, 
could you be more specific as to what exact guidance you want to be 
given (i.e., send text if you think the draft should say something about 
this ;o) )?

Thanks,

Gonzalo

Dale,

There are a couple of things in your draft on which I am not clear:

Section 3.2 Attended Transfers

In F8, INVITE to Carol you have included a References header with
"rel-xfer".

How does Bob's UA know to include this header at this time?  Bob has an
existing session with Alice but at the time of the INVITE to Carol, F8,
the UA does not know that a transfer is intended. The INVITE may be an
enquiry call with no intent to transfer. Are you proposing that all
INVITE requests when you have another session on hold will include this
header in case you decide to transfer later?

Section 3.3 Call Pick-up

F3 is a Subscribe using the dialog event package. RFC 4235 requires that
the dialog event package includes a Call-id and a To-tag.  Am I missing
something here? Perhaps there is another request which is not included
in your diagram?=20

Can you please clarify?

Hadriel,

Lets get the discussion back to your draft. While we could debate the
merits of B2BUAs for a long time they exist and do some 'interesting'
things.

My main comment on your draft at present is the proposal to allow a
proxy to insert the session-id header if it has not been inserted by the
UA. I think that this introduces additional problems of how to ensure
that the proxy in included in the message path of a new request that
uses the session-id that it inserted as a reference to the original
dialog.

I have included a few comments below.

This requires 2 things:
(1) that every B2BUA constantly be upgraded to handle whatever new
mechanism's syntax is for the identifiers, every time a new one is
defined. (e.g., new XML schema or new header)  I realize that's the
nature of "you break it, you fix it", but if people want to have their
new thing work without needing B2BUA's to be upgraded or re-configured,
then there needs to be some generic way of handling this.
(2) that the mechanism using the call-id+tags gets sent to the B2BUA
that changed them.  Often it will.  Sometimes it can't.  For example,
the mediactrl-framework model.  Stick a b2bua between the UA and the
Media-Control-Client, and the application doesn't work - or wouldn't
have, except they changed it to use a new identifier different from
call-id to avoid this problem.

[Ian Elz ] (1) is an issue with B2BUAs. Xavier's b2bua draft was an
attempt to give some guidance on how B2BUAs should behave to make them
as proxy like as possible. (2) I am not familiar with the
mediactrl-framework issues when using the call-id. I will look into this
further.


> Based upon RFC3261 a B2BUA MUST map the call-id as a Call-id MUST be
> globally unique. As a B2BUA is a UAS/UAC the dialogs on either side of
> the B2BUA are different dialogs and must have different Call-ids.

Actually that's debatable.  I don't think we'd want to say B2BUA's MUST
change the Call-ID.  3261 did say a B2BUA is the logical concatenation
of a UAS and UAC, but clearly not much text in 3261 was given to how a
B2BUA should operate.

[Ian Elz ] It is debatable but section 8.1.1.4 of RFC 3261 does specify:

"   In a new request created by a UAC outside of any dialog, the Call-ID
   header field MUST be selected by the UAC as a globally unique
   identifier over space and time unless overridden by method-specific
   behavior.  All SIP UAs must have a means to guarantee that the Call-
   ID header fields they produce will not be inadvertently generated by
   any other UA."

Thus as the B2BUA is a concatenation of a UAS and a UAC the UAC when it
creates the ongoing out-of-dialog request must create a call-id which is
globally unique which precludes using the call-id which was received by
the UAS part of the B2BUA.

This is pedantic view of the RFC but those are the words which are
included, agreed and published.

Some folks (from 3gpp) have asked that B2BAU's not change the
contact-uri if it's a GRUU, though I'm not exactly sure why.  There are
also some cases in which having a B2BUA change the contact to be its
specific instance doesn't work, because that address is not globally
reachable; so leaving it as a GRUU (or something like a GRUU), is
necessary but means out-of-dialog requests don't always reach the same
B2BUA instance.  This has been found in REFER transfer cases, where the
referred party can't reach the same B2BUA as the referrer can.

[Ian Elz ] I have seen some of the 3gpp CRs which have suggested making
this change. My present view is that this should not be changed. The
solution may be that a B2BUA inserted contact should always be globally
routable or if the received Contact is a gruu then the inserted Contact
should also be a gruu. There is work to be done in this area.

Depends what you mean by a malformed payload. If it is the syntax of the body itself, I would argue that it is reusing a lower layer mechanism because it just happens to do the right thing, rather than something that is correct from a layering point of view.

Yes. Because distinguishing real application responses from application functions that themselves require a response is almost impossible. So you end up putting payload in a 200 (OK) response to info for which you now need to generate an application level response. What next? Well you need to use an INFO to reject it. Which leads one directly to say that application level responses should go in an INFO in the first place.

I don't remember any history of this, but would contend that the way RFC
3903 text is written in regards to bodies in responses is tantamount to
saying "bodies in responses is for further study". It is basically
trying to say, if in implementing this you receive a body in a response,
then don't start failing things at the SIP transaction level.

And remember, this requires an event package to define the usage, and
you need RFCs to define event packages, so I suspect any expert review
or above would take a very deep look at any such definition.

Hi All,

I have some queries related to expires header in SIP message.

RFC 3261 Section 20.19
" The value of this field is an integral number of seconds (in decimal)
   between 0 and (2**32)-1, measured from the receipt of the request"

Does this mean 0 is a valid value of Expires header =3F I am confused =
because of "between" word here as meaning might different if "from 0 to  =
(2**32)-1" have used.

Does Expires value in INVITE is modified by intermittent SIP entities befor=
e=
 it reaches to its destination=3F
If yes, then what should be UAS behavior when it receives INVITE with value=
 =
0 in Expires header =3F Should UAS respond with 487 =3F

Section 13.1.1 [1]
  "If the request is an INVITE that contains an Expires header
 field, the UAS core sets a timer for the number of seconds
 indicated in the header field value.  When the timer fires, the
 invitation is considered to be expired.  If the invitation
 expires before the UAS has generated a final response, a 487
 (Request Terminated) response SHOULD be generated."


Thanks in Advance
Anita

Right, so that's one possible direction to go for INFO as well: don't mandate any model in the base spec.  Keep it simple.  Let the packages do their own dirty work, under review.

> -hadriel

I'm fine with that, as long as we leave some basic hooks for the 
packages to use. In particular:

- *some* error code that can be returned as the response to INFO,
   which indicates: I didn't like the *content* of the package.
   If we have a single response that can be used for that, then
   I expect that Reason can be used to refine it.

- don't define the meaning of a body in the response, but
   don't forbid it either. Let the significance be defined by
   the package.

- perhaps draw the distinction between 200 and 202 responses,
   where 200 means the package has been "accepted" by the receiving
   application and 202 means the package has simply been "queued"
   for the receiving app. (I don't know if this distinction is
   useful here or not.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

Is there some reason you need a different response code than 415 or 400?  Do you think the UAC can take some different automated action due to getting back a 488-type response than a 400, for example?

[I personally hate new response codes - middleboxes always seems to be asked to map them to a different number.]

Unless this has changed, I thought the Reason header was only allowed in requests? (even though I know people put it in responses, and honestly it was silly to only apply it to requests to begin with)

I hate using the -00 responses because they are so vague. If worse comes 
to worse then 400 can be used with a phrase to describe the actual 
problem. That can be enough for debugging. (I don't really expect 
anybody is going to recover from these errors.) But if somebody responds 
to me with this sort of error I would like to be able to tell that is 
the problem without having to talk to a developer of the responding device.

The main thing is to give guidance on what error should be used.

    The Reason header field MAY appear in any request within a dialog, in
    any CANCEL request and in any response whose status code explicitly
    allows the presence of this header field.

AFAIK there are no responses that allow it. But we could make a 
normative change to do so, to whatever response code we decide should be 
used. Or we can just punt this to the reason-phrase of the response.

	Thanks,

Its certainly valid in *some* contexts. For instance in REGISTER and 
SUBSCRIBE this is the way to terminate a registration or subscription.

According to table 2 of 3261, proxies are not permitted to add, modify, 
or delete this header. But of course a B2BUA can do as it wishes.

The above is SHOULD strength. I expect you will find many UAs that don't 
bother with this.

But if you are implementing the UAS, this would be a good thing to do. 
There is no point in establishing a session if the caller no longer 
wants it.

Hadriel arguing in favor of optionality and requirements language at

I'm certainly afraid that people have things like XML-formatting errors
and  "I parsed  the data you sent, but it did not make sense in my
application's current context" in mind.

Not a new condition, I'm afraid. If I were completely sane, would I do
this job?

If understanding how to decode the multipart MIME is critical to the
success of the request, then I expect the request to fail if the UAS
cannot decode it. Further, I want it to fail predictably in a way that
the request originator can understand, not in some cryptic
application/version dependent way.

Excellent suggestion. All in favor, please hum now ...

> INFO must carry a response. 

Putting application-level data into an INFO response is problematic as
this may make the INFO body larger than the transport package size, and
we have no way to reject large responses.

This is exactly why we stalemated on diagnostic responses.

Given the characteristics of SIP-as-transport, the only reasonable thing
to do (beside change SIP) is to require all application-layer responses
use SIP requests in the return direction onstead of piggybacking on the
SIP response. The SIP response can, in general, tells us only about the
handling of the request's delivery at a SIP level, not an application level.

"Expires: 0" is definitely valid, as it is used in SUBSCRIBEs that do
"one-shot retrieval" of event packages.  See RFC 3265.

Yes, it can be modified by SIP proxies.  (Officially, the proxy is
forwarding the message to the URI "sip:xxx@yyy?Expires=1234".  Since the
"Expires" header cannot be repeated, the new value replaces the old
value.)

The concept is that the INVITE expires immediately.  What might this
mean?  Clearly, the UA cannot "ring" for any length of time.  This
suggests that the INVITE should be given an immediate 487 response.

However, it seems that there should be an exception:  If the UAS is set
to answer immediately (that is, to respond 200 without waiting for human
intervention), as happens in some applications, it could instead
immediately respond with 200.

Then I guess we had better stop passing SDP in responses.

Why is it that responses can have a body???

You mean that a "Proxy" in particular could do this, right? (not that a B2BUA could do this?)

Right now the draft is written to make the matching mechanics basically optional for a node.  The Session-ID header has uses beyond dialog matching ones, and I prefer to keep the bar low for implementations to at least pass it through, or even generate it.  You're right that a Proxy implementing the matching function would need to keep itself in the path - good catch - I will add it if we decide Proxies should be able to do the matching function.  (and yes, it could only keep itself in the path in certain scenarios, so we may just not want to let Proxies do a matching function period to make the draft easier to comprehend)

Yes, and my own product does that as well by default (dialog transparency).  Many/most operators turn that off when they install it, fwiw.  But this isn't really about SBC's.  If it were only about SBC's, there would be other ways to skin this cat.  The problem is all B2BUA's.  The number of B2BUA vendors/products/types is scary.  Most of them seem to change Call-ID+tag's all the time, for reasons only they know.  I know it's not due to the security issues.  I know some of them change them to handle spirals correctly.  I know some of them change them for internal architecture reasons.  But I don't know all the reasons.  I can't speak for them.

That is technically and practically impossible.  If 3GPP thinks it's possible, I suggest they talk to people who actually deploy their technology - i.e., the operators. :)  SBC's have been able to generate the equivalent of GRUU's long before GRUU was invented, and it only works in certain cases.

[and I don't mean that as a slam against 3gpp - it's hard to get the operators' views in the IETF too; and yes I know operators attend 3gpp, but either their voices aren't heard, or they're not aware of the nuances - none of us are aware of the nuances across all sip-related uses, imho]

I think Kenny Rogers (or Don Schlitz) said it best: You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em. :)

If we can't agree on the right model for all INFO usages, then it's better to punt.  I don't think it will cause interop issues, because this is just a base spec and the details will be in the packages.

As I read 3261, a proxy can't do this. The section on adding headers 
from the URI to the message is in section 8, for UACs. In section 16, 
for proxies, there is no comparable language. Instead, the proxy must 
remove any parameters that aren't allowed in the R-URI, which would 
include the headers. And it may indeed add additional headers, but I 
believe it is restricted in doing so by Table 2. Table 2 doesn't permit 
the proxy to add, modify, or delete an Expires header.

Now this does seem a bit inconsistent. If a URI in a 3xx includes 
headers, then they would apply if the 3xx is returned to the UAC, but 
not apply if the 3xx is recursed by a proxy.

	Thanks,
	Paul

What you are suggesting is that to use multi-part MIME in current SIP methods, we cannot rely on currently deployed system behavior.  So you're basically proposing we either:
1) Never do multi-part MIME.
2) Do a new SIP version.

I'm ok with doing #1, but I don't think things are *that* bad anyway.  I think we can rely on systems to behave sanely enough to do a backwards-compatible multi-part that should work in most cases - for the cases it doesn't, I think it will fail explicitly (with a failure response), and *then* one can argue if you can re-send it without the other body parts, or if you just fail the call hard.  But at least by then you've actually hit an error, and it's not ALL deployed systems that will have the problem.

Although I do wonder about how much of a Red Herring this topic is - what exact use-cases do you guys have for multi-part bodies in SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, PUBLISH, and INFO that is not actually defined in a package for them?  Or are we in some theoretical La-La land? [no offense meant - I like La-La land]

I was just looking at a traces today from a well known vendor that included many NOTIFY requests with multi-part bodies. One included 16 body parts of two different Content-Types.

I think we can rely on systems to behave sanely enough to do a backwards-compatible multi-part that should work in most cases - for the cases it doesn't, I think it will fail explicitly (with a failure response), and *then* one can argue if you can re-send it without the other body parts, or if you just fail the call hard.  But at least by then you've actually hit an error, and it's not ALL deployed systems that will have the problem.

With regards to how to handle multiple body parts in any SIP message, I believe the issue we're concerned with is how to handle body-parts that are not for the actual context of the SIP message, in a backwards-compatible way, right?

In other words, the context for bodies by default is based on their message method type, and possibly package if the method type has packages (SUB/NOT/PUB, and now INFO).  And since for 3261 the Content-Disposition's default means "render" (unless C-T is app/sdp), then no C-D means render - where "render" has different meanings based on the context too.  For MESSAGE/INVITE/BYE it's basically render to the user in some fashion; for package ones it's render to the package application, which effectively is the "user" of the message.  Right?

So ISTM that the body-handling draft does that.  For new extensions going forward it would be done with a Content-ID and a C-D of "by-reference" in MIME, with a SIP header using a CID.  For older extensions it's handled by the option tags they already define, to make sure the recipient understands the extension and thus its additional body part's context. (I don't like that, but that's life)  And it's only really a problem for cases where the content-type collides with something valid for the message's context/package.

So I'm back to: this is no different for INFO.  INFO has a context, we're adding a sub-context with Info-Package to fix collisions of same content-types for different uses, and any SIP extension going forward uses a CID and content-id and C-D of 'by-reference' if it's not tied to the message's context.  The Info draft only needs to reference the body-handling draft, call out the fact that INFO and its Info-Package creates a context, and a quick reminder on what that means.  We can then pull out all the current text about bodies in the draft, including the cid parameter and such, and move on to more interesting things like responses and actually defining packages. :)

We got lucky with SDP, in that early versions of SDP combined with the  
cruft in early versions of SIP actually fit into one UDP packet. One  
of the probable issues with SDP-NG is that it might well not enjoy  
that characteristic, and as we add countless options, secondary  
bodies, and other cruft to SIP we're in danger of crossing the line.   
Will  UDP work for INFO responses? I dunno. Maybe, if we're lucky.

Do you feel lucky?

SIP's UDP request-response paradigm was at best excessively narrow in  
applicability and at worst ill-conceived. We'd have a lot fewer  
headaches if we had "offer" requests and "answer" requests at the  
application layer, and a clear demarc between that application layer  
and SIP's message-transport/rendezvous functions. Or if we'd just used  
TCP for everything to start with.

Of course, one might subscribe to the philosophy that since we've so  
hopelessly muddled the application and the transport in existing SIP  
that we might as well do so for revised-INFO so that we're at least  
consist in our mistakes. I find that to be a sensible but depressing  
argument.

Hi,
 
draft-ietf-sip-outbound-16 sec 6.

<snip> 
   When receiving a REGISTER request, the registrar MUST check from its
   Via header field if the registrar is the first hop or not.  If the
   registrar is not the first hop, it MUST examine the Path header of
   the request.  If the Path header field is missing or it exists but
   the first URI does not have an ob URI parameter, then outbound
   processing MUST NOT be applied to the registration.  In this case,
   the following processing applies: <NOTE> if the REGISTER request
contains
   the reg-id and the outbound option tag in a Supported header field,
   then the registrar MUST respond to the REGISTER request with a
439</NOTE>
   (First Hop Lacks Outbound Support) response; otherwise, the registrar
   MUST ignore the reg-id parameter of the Contact header.  See
   Section 11.6 for more information on the 439 response code.
</snip>


I just wonder why 439 is a must if  reg-id and the outbound option tag
in a Supported header field present in incoming REGISTER.
I think if registra thinks it cannot apply ob, it just follow normal
RFC3261 behavior and does not insert outbound into Require header of REG
response.

Moreover, If the registra does not understand ob, how could it responds
with 439?

I thinks this must-respond-439 opertion only applies to outbound option
tag in a Require header field in incoming REGISTER


Any thoughts?

Thanks

Regards,
-Rockson

Hi folks,
=20
in draft-ietf-sip-outbound-16 sec 9.1
=20
EP added a Record-Route to SUBSCRIBE
=20
   In message #2, EP1 adds the following Record-Route header:
=20
   Record-Route:
    <sip:GopIKSsn0oGLPXRdV9BAXpT3coNuiGKV@ep1.example.com;lr>
=20
However, I don't find the text that says EP must do this in this draft.
Initially, it looks like this is mandated in sec 5.3.2, however,
=20
in sec 5.3
=20
<snip>
If the Edge Proxy receives
   a request where the edge proxy is the host in the topmost Route
   header field value, and the Route header field value contains a flow
   token, the proxy MAY need to do additional processing described in
   the rest of this section.  Otherwise the edge proxy skips the
   procedures in this section, removes itself from the Route header
   field, and continues processing the request.
</snip>
=20
since there's no Route header in the incoming SUBSCRIBE, so sec 5.3
should not be applied here in this scenario.
=20
Am I missing something?
=20
=20
thanks

[JRE] The answer is we didn't have a requirement for this. I agree with

Also I don't think methods such as SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and PUBLISH allow
>1 event package, so why should INFO allow >1 Info package?

[JRE] One reason is 3PCC behaviour. Suppose the B2BUA does 3PCC attended
call transfer, i.e., it wants to join together two existing calls, each
with its own call-ID. The resulting call will have different call-IDs on
either side of the B2BUA, even if the original calls had only a single
call-ID each.

You mean that a "Proxy" in particular could do this, right? (not that a
B2BUA could do this?)

[Ian Elz ] I think that a B2BUA could insert the session-id and that
getting back to the B2BUA would have to use the same mechanism as using
the existing call-id/tags dialog referencing for getting the new Request
back to the B2BUA where it could perform the Session-id to call-id/tags
mapping.
For a proxy this is more difficult as ensuring that a proxy appears in
the path of the new request does not appear to have a solution. The
problem with a proxy inserting session-id is that the UA which receives
the request containing the inserted session-id may attempt to create a
new request using the session-id to reference the previous
session/dialog but with no way of definitively routing back via the
proxy which included the session-id the new request is bound to fail. I
think that it is better in this case to not include the session-id and
let the existing mechanisms be used. As session-id usage spreads then
the use of session-id will become more common.

Right now the draft is written to make the matching mechanics basically
optional for a node.  The Session-ID header has uses beyond dialog
matching ones, and I prefer to keep the bar low for implementations to
at least pass it through, or even generate it.  You're right that a
Proxy implementing the matching function would need to keep itself in
the path - good catch - I will add it if we decide Proxies should be
able to do the matching function.  (and yes, it could only keep itself
in the path in certain scenarios, so we may just not want to let Proxies
do a matching function period to make the draft easier to comprehend)

[Ian Elz ] As stated above if the proxy does not support 'matching' then
there is a problem when one UA supports session-id and the other
doesn't. Any attempt to reference a session/dialog using session-id will
fail.

Hi,

Most of the multipart cases I've seen have worked fine, because the
Content-Type normally tells everything the receiver needs to know (e.g.
SDP, ISUP, XML-whatever, etc).

I guess the potential problem is when you send things like image/jpeg
etc.

For info packages, I still don't understand why we can't specify a
common content-type value. The body part contains an info package, so
the content-typ is info something.

That way we would solve the how-to-find-info-body-parts problem, and
whatever common stuff then needs to be done for SIP can be done outside
the work of info.

Regards,

Christer

Just to clarify: a company brought a CR to the 3gpp meeting, but the CR
was not accepted.

draft-worley-references-01 contains a section comparing its proposal
with the other two session identification drafts.
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-worley-references-01#section-5)  The
overlap with draft-loreto-sipping-dialog-correlation-01 is rather small,
but draft-kaplan-sip-session-id-00 could be incorporated into the system
of draft-worley-references-01.

Sort of. 3261 already introduced the possibility for some of them - 
'alert' and 'icon' bodies, as well as S/MIME.

Many implementations likely simply never bothered to consider any of 
that. And those that did may have used a variety of techniques to 
identify the parts they care about for particular purposes.

So "backwards-compatible" depends a lot of what has already been 
implemented in the wild, not just what the specs say.

IMO, if you read 3261 carefully, then you need to sort out most of the 
existing use cases based on the Content-Disposition. However there is 
great ambiguity about how to interpret multipart bodies themselves if 
they lack a C-D.

The above is a reasonable interpretation, and consistent with the 
body-handling draft.

This certainly seems to be the intuitive interpretation and its hard to 
find a reason not to follow it.

I think we are *forced* to take this interpretation for the existing 
uses in order to have any sort of backward compatibility. But IMO it is 
a perversion of "render".

> So ISTM that the body-handling draft does that. 

Yes. But I think we should consider the existing uses to be 
"grandfathered", rather than establishing a precedent for "render" in 
future uses. (That point may be debatable.)

We have two choices that the extension can make. It can do as you say. 
Or it can base things on a content-disposition type. If so it will need 
to define what that means in the contexts it covers.

For instance some new FOOBAR method might require a body in some cases 
and specify:
- the C-D for *its* body is "foobar"
- or the the C-D for its body is "render", and that such body part(s?)
   should be "rendered" by carrying out some specified processing
- or it could introduce a new header, which references the body part,
   which then has a C-D of "by-reference".

*In principle* an extension could simply define a new C-D, and the 
processing that should occur when a part with the disposition is 
encountered, independent of the method it is in. That would be 
*relatively* safe if it was always passed with handling=optional. But 
that might not work out so well in practice.

An extension *header* that needs to reference a body is more 
constrained. Based on the body-handling draft, the body part it 
references can be of any C-D, but it ought to be "by-reference" unless 
the constructor of the message wants the same body part to be processed 
once according to its reference, and again according to whatever 
implicit processing should be done based on its disposition.

There are other considerations if one body part references another body 
part.

The point is that, future extensions should clearly specify how this 
should be done.

The claim that its only a problem when the content-type collides is 
problematic. That implies a certain algorithm for deciding how to 
process body parts. Not an obvious one, or one that is written down 
anywhere.

IMO C-D takes precedence over C-T for deciding how to process a body 
part. If I get a body part with a C-D of "render" and a C-T of 
application/SDP, then I should not process it as an offer/answer. Rather 
I should be looking for how to "render" it based on the definition of 
render for this method. If I don't know how to render an application/sdp 
body (quite likely) then it is just erroneous.

Now maybe my opinion is wrong. But if so, then we should define whatever 
rules we think there should be.

As Eric proposed it, the new info-packages don't depend on the INFO 
context, since they use CID references. Only the legacy INFO depends on 
the INFO context.

I think it remains an open issue if that is the way we want it.

If the Info-Package header is to reference the body part using cid, then 
  the draft can't avoid mentioning that.

And I think it needs to be more explicit about how body parts relate to 
legacy info - explaining that there is a special meaning of "render" for 
legacy INFO messages.

Then there is the question of what "render" means for an INFO that 
carries an info-package. My guess is that we don't want to allow a 
single INFO to have both an Info-Package *and* a legacy INFO body. So I 
think it will be needful to define that in a new INFO, bodies of 
disposition "render" (other than multipart/mixed) will be ignored.

The scary part is that demuxing based on C-T *does* work in a lot of 
simple cases, so it may be used widely. But it doesn't work in general. 
To work generally, it will be necessary to first demux based on C-D.

If we have a lot of implementations basing things on C-T, then they may 
not be inserting, or doing the necessary processing for C-D. That means 
they are likely to break in more complex cases going forward.

If you chose a standard C-T for all info-packages, that constrains the 
syntax that it may contain. Yet each package is going to want to choose 
the syntax(es) that it uses. And some of them will want to be standard 
ones, such as image/jpeg. To deal with that your "standard" info C-T 
would have to be a container for an arbitrary mime type. So you have 
simply pushed the problem down a level.

IMO its a really bad way to go.

Interesting...  People have discussed proxies for a long time as if they
handled target URIs similarly to UASs generating initial requests, that
is, header-parameter parts are extracted from the request-URI and turned
into headers.

Looking at RFC 3261 section 16.6 step 2, none of this is discussed.
Step 5 says "The proxy MAY add any other appropriate header fields to
the copy at this point." which seems to allow the proxy great latitude.

Table 2 does forbid the proxy from modifying the Expires header.  But
perhaps that's an oversight?  One could also argue that the proxy rules
apply to UACs when they're recursing on 3xx responses, as they're
"acting like proxies" then.

I'm getting a bit confused by this discussion, and I think part of the
problem is terminology:

Let's avoid using the word "match" unless we mean a process which has
the usual properties of "match":  (1) If A matches B, then B matches A.
(2) If A matches B, then A and B are considered to some degree to be the
same thing.  Thus, if two requests have the same Via branch parameters,
they "match" because they are (should be) identical.  And if two
requests have the same call-id and tags, then they "match" because they
are part of the same dialog.  (And that relationship is symmetric.)

I think what people want is the concept "references".  If A references
B, then B does not necessarily reference A.  Thus, a dialog event
package references a dialog, but the dialog does not reference the
dialog event package.

I believe that we intend for two message to have the same Session-Id if
and only if they are legs of the same dialog (in the sense that each leg
was generated by a B2BUA as a continuation of another leg).  (Actually,
that should be "dialog set", as created by one out-of-dialog request.)

        Yup exactly - that's what I meant by not being "re-creatable",
        and why I included a system/node ID and MAC into the equation.
        Not really a secret local key per se - and maybe I should just
        say that instead in the draft.
        
If the system/node ID is not prescribed to be secret, the adversaries
will get ahold of it and be able to check the hashes.  But I see that in
-01, you've noted that it has to be secret.

        Note the "adversary" so to speak is just that a downstream node
        can get a Call-ID and must not be able to tell from the Call-ID
        it got, what the Session-ID should be, so they can't tell the
        Call-ID was changed by a b2bua.  Of course an upstream node
        would be able to tell - for example the UAC would if it received
        a subscribe for the dialog-event that had a session-id it
        created, with a call-id+tags it didn't.  But then one of the
        main points of this exercise is to make those cases work.  I
        can't guarantee that all operators would want it to work in such
        cases, but for those that don't want it to, nothing will help us
        make it work.
        
There's something I don't understand here.  You mention "received a
SUBSCRIBE for the dialog-event that had a session-id it created, etc."
What does that mean?  I assume you mean that the UAS of the original
call (or something in its near network vicinity) wanted to subscribe to
the dialog events of the UAC, filtering for the one dialog it knows of.
That would be:

	SUBSCRIBE [contact taken from INVITE seen at UAS] SIP/2.0
	Call-Id: [something new]
	Session-Id: [something new]
	Event: dialog;session-id=[session-id of INVITE]

That would go back through the B2BUA (or one of its brethren) because
the Contact as seen at the UAS was munged as necessary by the B2BUA to
ensure that that would happen.  The B2BUA would change the Call-ID, but
it would leave the Session-Id and the Event session-id parameter
unchanged.

But there would be nothing to compare the Event session-id parameter
*to*.  And the Session-Id would have no apparent relationship to the
Call-Id or tags of the SUBSCRIBE as seen at the original UAC (the UAS of
the SUBSCRIBE).

This is still very fuzzy to me.

If a B2BUA (B) is doing 3pcc:

	         |------ C
	         |
	A ------ B
	         |
	         |------ D

and it first connects A to C, and later transfers the call to D, will A 
and C and D all have the same Session-Id?

Then take same picture, but make B be a conference focus, to which A, C 
and D are all connected. Will they ever have the same Session-Id?

Also, how are dialog event packages supposed to work? Is it expected 
that they will be extended to contain Session-Ids?

	Thanks,
	Paul

Its amazing isn't it, what we think the specs say vs. what they actually 
say?

I have to admit that before replying to you I wasn't certain where 
headers in URIs were applied. I had to review 3261 before I decided that 
it was only UACs, not Proxies.

Proxies *do* have a lot of latitude. But they are constrained by Table 
2. I know a lot of people don't like table 2 - there are a lot of 
limitations in what it can describe, and it isn't maintained as well as 
it might be. Yet there are things, like this, that are not stated 
anywhere else.

We need to input from a real old-timer to answer that. Its before my time.

That would have been one way to do it. But that isn't how it was written 
up. And they can't be exactly the same. A UAC can act on an http: URI in 
a 3xx, where a proxy isn't permitted to.

What this will really do is revive all the chatter about banning forking 
and recursing on 3xx.

" The value of this field is an integral number of seconds (in decimal)
   between 0 and (2**32)-1, measured from the receipt of the request"

Does this mean 0 is a valid value of Expires header ? I am confused because=
 of "between" word here as meaning might different if "from 0 to  (2**32)-1=
" have used.

>>> It doesn't look like properly.  See  RFC 3261 Section 13.2.1

   The UAC MAY add an Expires header field (Section 20.19) to limit the
   validity of the invitation.  If the time indicated in the Expires
   header field is reached and no final answer for the INVITE has been
   received, the UAC core SHOULD generate a CANCEL request for the
   INVITE, as per Section 9.

So, immediately after INVITE, the UAC should generate CANCEL.  But it has t=
o wait until it gets some response.

Section 9.1

   If no provisional response has been received, the CANCEL request MUST
   NOT be sent; rather, the client MUST wait for the arrival of a
   provisional response before sending the request.

Does Expires value in INVITE is modified by intermittent SIP entities befor=
e it reaches to its destination?

Proxies do not modify headers present in the request it receives.  See sect=
ion 16.6.

If yes, then what should be UAS behavior when it receives INVITE with value=
 0 in Expires header ? Should UAS respond with 487 ?


Section 13.1.1 [1]
  "If the request is an INVITE that contains an Expires header
 field, the UAS core sets a timer for the number of seconds
 indicated in the header field value.  When the timer fires, the
 invitation is considered to be expired.  If the invitation
 expires before the UAS has generated a final response, a 487
 (Request Terminated) response SHOULD be generated."

So the UAS should generate a 487 right away.

Thanks in Advance
Anita

I use the word "match" because the property of "matching" is what I mean.  "A" does have to equal "B" symmetrically, but the thing that is symmetric is the Session-ID ("A" and "B" are Session-IDs).
The "Reference" portion is to the general concept of a SIP session (or "dialog-set if you prefer), not the specific dialog leg defined by a call-id+tag set, so you could say a Session-ID is a reference to a collection of dialog legs.
The Session-ID alone does NOT really reference a specific call-id+tag set, for example.
For some cases that's all you need to match to get an action/property you desire, for example for correlating SIP messages in a wireshark trace.
In other cases you need to match both a Session-ID and a remote-tag, in order to "reference" a specific dialog leg - for example in a Replaces case.

We can still use C-D.

The syntax can be very simple - for example package name plus a binary
string which can contain whatever (the package defines the exact syntax
within that binary string). It works a little like the SDP fmtp
attribute.

It's simple, and it does not require support of new parameter,
content-ids etc.

The idea (and it may well be a half-baked idea) was to add the Session-ID value into the dialog-event package body (the dialog-info XML doc schema in urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info namespace) as another XML element.  In other words, to add a "session-id" element wherever a "call-id" element can also be, such that a consumer of that received XML doc, if it understands that element, could try to match its value to one of its known session-id values for its known dialogs, if and only if the "call-id" one failed to match a call-id.  Likewise for other package XML docs that have "call-id".

For the Replaces/Target-Dialog/etc. SIP headers, one idea would be to add another param similar to the call-id param, for session-id.  But that's just one option.  Option 2 was to in fact keep the Session-ID header itself the same for that out-of-dialog INVITE created by a Refer-To, by embedding the Session-ID header in Refer-To.  There's pro's/con's to either approach, and I don't have an opinion on which is right/wrong/better/worse.

Christer,

I just think using a single C-T for all packages is a bad idea.
Its quite likely that some packages will support multiple content types. 
Its also quite likely that some/many/most packages will want to use 
*existing* content-types. We already have a mechanism for negotiating 
support for content-types. We should exploit that, not discard it here.

We already have several other ways to skin this cat:
- use cid references and the by-reference c-d for the package body
- define "render" as the c-d for the package body in an INFO
- define a new c-d (e.g. "info-package") for the package body

IMO *all* of those are preferable to bastardizing the C-T for the purpose.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hi,

We still need text for the security section in the 199 draft.

Robert said the following in his comments on the draft:

"There's a lot to talk through here. For instance, I can spoof 199s to
affect how a call is ultimately answered in ways that are different
(from the endpoints visibility into what happened point-of-view) from
cancels/byes or even other response manipulation."

As Robert says, calls can already be affected by spoofing responses
and/or CANCEL/BYE requests, so I guess the text we are looking for is
the "different ways" of spoofing that 199 could be used for.

If a spoofed 199 is sent to a UAC, the UAC will (assuming it supports
199) terminate that specific dialog. If a spoofed non-200 final response
is sent to a UAC, it will terminate the whole session setup. So, I guess
someone could use 199 to terminate a dialog which would be used to
provide the UAC with some important information, but the call setup
would still continue. However, the same thing could be achieved by
spoofing a BYE towards the UAC on the same dialog (eventhough I think
many terminals would terminte the whole session setup in that case...).

Feel free to do some brainstorming :)

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

- CID is too complex, and I think it will prevent some people from
moving from legacy to info packages.

- "Render" as the c-d is probably not 100% waterproof, since other body
types may also use it.

- I DO still strongly support a new c-d for the package body, but it
seems that others have issues with that.

Regards,

Christer

Yes, under the current model it would.  It's not a necessary scenario to have the same Session-ID, IMO, but it's covered that way. (but clearly the remote-tag would not match if D sent a Subscribe to A)

As currently defined no, it would not.  I talked to some people about that at the IETF meeting, and they thought that was the right thing to do, as do I; but we couldn't define a textual explanation of what properties made that right.


> Also, how are dialog event packages supposed to work? Is it expected

Yes.  As an optional XML element update to them, which only gets used for matching if the call-id element did not match.

Actually, there *is* a way of making a Proxy in the path, depending on where the Proxy is.  If it's the edge proxy between the UAC and its registrar, have it insert itself in the Path header for the Register, and any/all requests trying to get to that UA using GRUU/AoR should in theory go through that Proxy.

Yes but it would have failed *anyway*.  That's the point - Session-ID is not making it worse.  It's just offering a way to make it better, in certain scenarios.  BTW, for networks like 3GPP the set of scenarios it could cover is rather large, because basically we're talking about the P-CSCF doing this thing, and probably I-BCF's.

And besides, the matching behavior for Session-ID is basically gravy - the meat is getting a common identifier across B2BUA's, for troubleshooting and whatever other needs we find for such an identifier.

If there's consensus that the matching mechanism is too scary/radical to consider, that can be pulled out into a separate draft which uses the Session-ID header value defined in this draft.

How is CID "too complex"??? The id can be hard coded in most cases. So 
its just some additional boiler plate to add into the request. And it 
adds *1* extra header to the message. Anybody who can't manage that 
shouldn't be sending SIP messages.

I do think that a *new* c-d would be clearer than reusing "render".

I guess my preferences (1-100, 1 best) are:

1) new c-d
2) cid
10) c-d "render"
100) single c-t for info-packages.

OK, at least the answers are the ones I was expecting to get.

You mentioned something like "dialog-set". I'm not certain yet if "set" 
is the proper term here. But assume for the moment that it is.

Then what you really have is a "dialog-set-id" right? Not a session-id.

It would be good to have a formal definition of a dialog-set. That would 
help with sorting out when individual dialogs get the same 
dialog-set-id. It might also go a long way toward providing a basis for 
defining an SBC and what it can/can't do. (I suspect that an SBC creates 
dialog-sets, and other B2BUAs do not.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

Nope, they actually can't.  Not in the INFO context.  Nor for that matter in the SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, or PUBLISH contexts.  If you add a body with the "render" C-D to one of those message method types, you're actually telling the far-end to give that body-part to its "user", which is the package application.  INFO is not the same context as MESSAGE.

In my mind, content-disposition is for a value that is basically a verb.  If each package-body needs a new verb to describe giving it to the package, or even if we create a common verb for all packages to give that body part to the package, then all we're doing is re-inventing the wheel.  The wheel is the INFO method name and Info-Package header value, which create the necessary and sufficient context with which to extract bodies of disposition "render" (or any specific disposition defined by the package).  The wheel is already capable of turning, since it appears to be turning fine in legacy INFO use.  We don't need to add hubcaps to make it more expensive. :)

>How is CID "too complex"??? The id can be hard coded in most cases. So
its just some additional boiler plate to add into the request. And it

Even if the value is hard coded on the sender side, the receiver will
still have to parse it - unless we define a hard coded value which
everyone must always use for info packages...

If we would allow multiple info packages per message I could see the use
of CID, but for a single info package I think a new c-d (or c-t) is much
more simple.

I agree with 1) :)

>Nope, they actually can't.  Not in the INFO context.  Nor for that

So, there is no risk that someone would insert a legacy INFO body part
with "render"?

So, you are basically saying: we don't need to do anything as far as
find-the-body-part-with-the-info-package is concerned? We simple specify
that one inserts a Info-Package header with the package name, and that's
it? Whatever C-D/C-T value is used is then defined by the package
itself.

Well, since I assume most INFOs will be sent with a single body part
anyway, I guess it would work for those cases...

Christer

True, it must parse it. And then it must seek out the body part that has 
the proper cid. Otherwise it must seek out the body part that has the 
proper C-D. Not much different there. Certainly not much of an 
additional hurdle if you have already agreed to implement the rest of 
the new info-package machinery.

I think we're just going 'round and 'round on basically a non-issue.

Making *any* changes to INFO which don't provide real, tangible, and immediate value to either the developer or the customer/user, does not bode itself well to getting implementation.  Because INFO works.

Having a negotiation/detection scheme provides real, immediate value, by avoiding/reducing configuration.

Having a sub-context for the context already created by the "INFO" method does *not* provide such value, because there are no collisions/confusion in the real world AFAIK; but it was a common complaint from the IETF, so we put the Info-Package header in to resolve that.  It can basically be handled as syntactic sugar by current implementations, and is similar to Sub/Not/Pub, so fine.

Then somehow between IETF Dublin and Minneapolis, a mere 3.5 months (but a world apart in Guinness flavor), the draft doubled in size, adding another 20 pages.  To do what?  To add more dis-ambiguation and contextualizing, for a problem that has never actually been seen in the wild??  How many contexts of contexts, and meanings of meanings, do we need?  What value does that add over the currently deployed INFO?

No matter what we do, legacy info usage will have body parts with "render".

I guess maybe you mean they might *combine* the use of a single INFO for 
one legacy INFO usage *and* one info-package??? They can only do that if 
we define that they may, which I expect we will not, if we are not 
allowing multiple packages. If we define that they can't, its just a 
matter of what the error is: either its
- erroneous attempt to use INFO for both legacy and info-package
- or its: too many package bodies for info package

And note that you can screw up with cid references too, by including the 
same Content-ID in two different body parts.

People will always find a way to screw up. They will just have to deal 
with it until they get smarter.

I don't know what he is saying. But IMO we can't have just any old 
combination of C-D/C-T be the package.

No matter what, each body part does have a C-D - either explicitly or 
implicitly. And each brings its own "verb" with it. If a new one is not 
defined and used, and none is specified, then that verb will be "render".

But I don't agree that the C-D is a verb. "render" is a verb. But 
"inline", "attachment", "session", "early-session", "icon", 
"by-reference" are not verbs. And "alert" and "signal" (from 3204) might 
be nouns or verbs.

Hadriel,

Is the problem that the document is hard to implement? Or just that you 
think it has too many words?

IMO when we leave ambiguity there will be problems.
I would rather see more words than have a brief but ambiguous document.
More words do not (necessarily) make the implementation more difficult.

Making the wrong choice of words can complicate the implementation.

Its also the case that we end up using a lot more words (in emails) 
along the way to convince ourselves that we all agree on what is meant. 
Once we agree, it may not take so many words in the document to 
unambiguously specify what we have decided.

We know we have needs for multipart, for things like Geoloc, and 
probably more, that are orthogonal to other usages. We are headed for a 
train wreck on that because 3261 didn't say enough about that. The body 
handlng draft will hopefully address much of that. We just need to try 
to ensure that other things play well with that.

	Thanks,
	Paul

How exactly does INFO work in conjunction with other extensions (e2m,  
AIB, SAML) that add bodies?

How do you KNOW it works with deployed phones? I haven't seen any  
implementations with those extensions applied to deployed phones, yet.

if we can see that INFO packages (and other SIP requests, perhaps) are  
going to have problems with other extensions that add bodies, then we  
have to fix it.

I don't know - it's like asking me how I know my chimney is big enough for Santa Claus.  The odds are not high I'll ever find out; but I'm not rebuilding the chimney to fit him - he has to fit in the chimney, because it's already built, and it's the same size as everyone else's chimney.

Right but there's the rub - the phones are DEPLOYED.  It's not them that need a'changin', nor *could* they be changed.  It's AIB/e2m/saml/foobar that need to be changed.

No, actually we don't.  We have to change the extensions to not have a problem with INFO - or any other SIP message type, for that matter.
Otherwise, what you're really saying is that every single message type in SIP needs to be changed - requests and responses - because this is NOT specific to INFO.  Good luck with that.  I'm sure people will love to change their implementations and upgrade all systems just in case unicorns show up someday.

Exactly.  Not just legacy INFO, BTW - Sub/Not/Pub/Mess/etc.

Of course, and I know document size is not a good measurement of complexity.
But it does have a psychological effect, fwiw.

Anyway, no my problem with the draft is it's trying to fix things that either aren't broken, or are broken for everything else and should not be fixed in this specific document. (and I'd debate how they should be fixed, but that's another topic)

Right, so do you also plan to have an update RFC, to change the C-D's of their context's bodies, for each of RFC 3261 (INVITE/ACK), 3265 (SUB/NOT), 3311 (UPDATE), 3428 (MESSAGE), 3262 (PRACK), 3515 (REFER), and 3903 (PUBLISH)?  Most of which have existential proofs of deployed use, and most of which are significant deployment use?  (at least I think INVITE is fairly popular - I could be wrong)

Or would you rather replace RFCs 3893 (AIB), RFC 3420 (sipfrag), and whatever current drafts do not dis-ambiguate themselves from the deployed message type context's bodies?
(And for 3893bis at least, I would assert the subject line of such a doc should start with the words "Moving to Experimental...", if not "Deprecation of...")

I think very few people on this planet know what a SIP "dialog" is. :)
But the word "Session" is a more common word for operators (even though its definition in SIP is far more ambiguous, IMO).

For example, I think in your first 3PCC example (up top) most people really do expect that the same Session-ID be used for A-to-C.  Whether it should be the same for B-D is what (IMO) is fine but not necessary, but that's just my opinion; and I bet plenty of operators would consider that the same "Session" too and be surprised if it wasn't.

I don't think so.  For example, I would argue that half the SIP functional roles defined in 3GPP create dialog-sets in actual deployment.  Or for example, what a find-me app server does, which hunts for a user at multiple targets; or even what a typical IP-PBX does; or what the market-leading "feature servers" seem to do.

Basically, my assertion is that if you receive a SIP request from A as a UAS, and route or fork it to one or more targets (B/C/D) as a UAC, you have created a single dialog-set.  Let's assume it establishes with B.  IF you receive an in-dialog or dialog-referential request from A or B, and act upon that request as the UA without forwarding it back to A or B and the action creates another dialog, (e.g., you create a new INVITE), then I'd argue you're probably creating a new dialog-set; because that's what should have been created had it actually gone back to A or B and they'd created a new dialog.  But really I'd defer to other people's opinions on that.

You mean the way 3261 was simplified by not saying much about multipart 
and not requiring that it be supported, because that wasn't broken in 2543?

Most of which have existential proofs of deployed use, and most of which are significant deployment use?  (at least I think INVITE is fairly popular - I could be wrong)

I don't think we need to change common usage of existing deployed stuff. 
We can grandfather the usages.

But by tightening up the required behavior when multipart is being used, 
we may indeed require some deployed devices to be updated to remain 
compliant. Without being updated they will continue to work in those 
cases where they work today. And many of the probably wouldn't have 
worked in some of those currently unused multipart cases anyway.

(We *do* make changes, such as the essential corrections and loop fixes.)

AFAIK we haven't identified a need to do that. If we do, so be it.

I just want it to be clear under what circumstances you can use multiple 
body parts in a message, and how a recipient of a message containing 
multiple parts figures out how to process it.

Just in the thread we have already heard a explanation of doing it based 
solely on C-T, which is really wrong. So its obviously not clear now.

That's not a relevant analogy and you know it. :)
3261 was an update for the base draft of SIP, upon which everything else  was dependent, for all intents and purposes.  Are you claiming this info draft is of that type?  Will the changes we make in here apply to all other RFCs, or all other message types, which normatively reference 3261 for their mechanics?  Hardly.  Do we need to fix all known issues of RFC 3261 and all known problems of all its extensions which could possibly occur in an INFO message transaction, simply because they can happen in an INFO and this INFO update happens to be on our plate right now?  Because this multi-part thing is only like #32 on the Billboard top-100 list of rfc3261 problems.

This is an update to the INFO RFC, to address known problems with INFO - and in particular the problem of support-negotiation and message context.  If you're claiming its scope is broader, we have a big disconnect, because that was not my understanding of WG consensus for this work.

For example, I don't think we need to define how to make RFC 4474 work for INFO if it crosses B2BUA's.  That's a general problem for all messages. (nevermind the fact we can't agree on a solution)  Nor do I think we need to copy text from draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix into this draft, even though that applies to INFO, because that draft addresses problems for all message types.

There's nothing "special" about this multi-part issue for INFO over any other request method.

Right, so that has two clear aspects to it:
1) Where do we solve it.
2) How do we solve it.

I assert that every issue raised so far on this thread with respect to multiple body parts has been equally applicable to most if not all SIP message types.  No one has refuted that assertion as far as I can tell.

I claim, therefore, that the answer to (1) is: in a separate draft which applies to all messages.  Otherwise we run the risk that (a) we don't solve it the same way, and (b) we delay this draft, and (c) we create a case where someone fixes their handling for INFO multi-part bodies but not other message types because they only implemented this draft, and we end up with split UA personality disorder. :)

That is about aspect (2).  I agree with you completely that C-T is not the right answer, but I don't see what it has to do with this draft.  We shouldn't be defining a solution to the problem for *INFO*.  We should be updating INFO to fix what's broken in it now, and defining a solution for all messages in a separate draft (presumably the body-handling draft).

Hi
=20
I have a doubt related to resubmitting of the INVITE request for
421/420. Can any one please clarify me? =20
=20
While re-submitting a INVITE request upon receiving a 421 Extension
Required/420 Bad Extension, Are there any recommendation of using the
same Call-Id/From tag of original INVITE request in the resubmitted
request? If so, is there any reason/use-case for such recommendation?
=20
Regards
Srikanth

Hi,
=20
RFC3261 8.1.3.5 is pretty clear:
=20
"   In all of the above cases, the request is retried by creating a new
   request with the appropriate modifications.  This new request
   constitutes a new transaction and SHOULD have the same value of the
   Call-ID, To, and From of the previous request, but the CSeq should
   contain a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous."
=20
Best regards,
Ben.
=20
Ps: Ask questions about the existing protocol at the sip-implementors
list

Hadriel,

I would like to agree with this. My only reservation is that if the
generic solution requires that each document that defines usage of a
body part in SIP needs to specify something additional (e.g., CID in a
header field), then we would need to come back and update the
Info-Events draft/RFC.

I am not sure we do. We only need to e.g. allow generic-param in the
Info-Package header ABNF, and if needed someone can then in future
define (in a separate draft) a CID parameter for Info-Package.

Christer

We do allow multipart for legacy INFO (well, at least we don't disallow
it).

Do we need to say anything about the number of packages?

Hi,
=20
RFC3261 8.1.3.5 is pretty clear:
=20
"   In all of the above cases, the request is retried by creating a new
   request with the appropriate modifications.  This new request
   constitutes a new transaction and SHOULD have the same value of the
   Call-ID, To, and From of the previous request, but the CSeq should
   contain a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous."
=20
Best regards,
Ben.

Ps: Ask questions about the existing protocol at the sip-implementors
list

Subject: [Sip] Resubmitted INVITE request for 421 and 420


Hi
=20
I have a doubt related to resubmitting of the INVITE request for
421/420. Can any one please clarify me? =20
=20
While re-submitting a INVITE request upon receiving a 421 Extension
Required/420 Bad Extension, Are there any recommendation of using the
same Call-Id/From tag of original INVITE request in the resubmitted
request? If so, is there any reason/use-case for such recommendation?
=20
Regards
Srikanth

I agree that there is nothing special about INFO in contrast to any 
other message that defines use of a body. (Well, there is *something* 
special about it - we are considering it after the body-handling draft.)

I think *every* draft that specifies the use of a body needs to specify 
how that body is identified.

The body-handling draft can clarify for all the preexisting RFCs, and it 
also gives the general framework that applies to new drafts too. That 
eases the burden of what needs to be in new drafts, but IMO *something* 
should be in each new draft. It can be as simple as saying that it 
consumes bodies of C-D "render". (We can continue to discuss if "render" 
is the best choice.)

Eric knows way more about mime than I do. He seems to think that our use 
of C-D is wrong, which is why I think he chose to use cid instead. I 
certainly think we should take his position seriously. I don't know what 
the best answer is here, but I think we ought to decide what we think 
the best practice is, and document it.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Otherwise we run the risk that (a) we don't solve it the same way, and (b) we delay this draft, and (c) we create a case where someone fixes their handling for INFO multi-part bodies but not other message types because they only implemented this draft, and we end up with split UA personality disorder. :)

We shouldn't be defining a solution to the problem for *INFO*.  We should be updating INFO to fix what's broken in it now, and defining a solution for all messages in a separate draft (presumably the body-handling draft).

I'm not sure I understand the question.  We should say: 1 INFO, 1 package.  You make it sound like a package is a body-part.  It's not.  A package just defines a specific message use context, and rules thereof.  You can define a info-package that specifies no bodies, for example.

Adding support for multiple packages, is like asking for a message to have multiple usage contexts and rules.  It makes my head hurt. :)

I concur strongly with this position.

I started thinking about the which-application-do-I-give-this-message- 
to API, and realized that for some API models, multiple packages per  
INFO would be a major furball. Let's just not go there.

I'm ok with this, and I thought it had already been settled. Why are we 
rehashing it?

Christer asked "Do we need to say anything about the number of  
packages?"

to which I believe we have an answer: "Yes. One per INFO".

Hi,

packages?"
>
>to which I believe we have an answer: "Yes. One per INFO".

IF we would end up using CID, I still don't see the problem. There would
be a direct "link" between a Info-Package value and a body part
(assuming there is an associated body part).

If we are NOT going to use CID (or any other mechanism which creates the
same link) I am ok with one-per-INFO.

Regards,

Christer

If the UAC can modify the INVITE to not user or require the extension in
question, but nonetheless perform the "same" operation (in some sense),
then it would be reasonable for the UAC to re-submit the new INVITE
using the same Call-Id and an incremented CSeq.  (This is in parallel
with all other uses of re-submission.)

But I have never heard of a case where re-submission could be used to
recover from 420/421.

And that's why we're still discussing it.

No, we're still discussing it because you people are stubborn, as am I. ;)
We clearly all have different definitions for the KISS principle, which is probably natural.

Let's imagine, for sake of argument, that the solution to the general SIP message problem of dis-ambiguating body parts which don't belong to the message context, were to be solved by creating a CID for all the body-parts that *did* belong to the message context.  I think that would be incredibly foolish, maybe even pathological, but let's just pretend that we decided it was the right solution... (nice setup, eh? :)
Would we:
a) Put the CID URL in specific SIP headers unique to each message type, for example "Info-Package:", "Event:", "Invite-cid:", "Message-cid:", etc.?
b) Put the CID URL in a SIP message header common to all message types?

Now I would claim that any sane human would go with option (b), thereby nixing multiple Info-Packages to begin with. (and oh by the way showing why we shouldn't try to solve this for Info only)
But let's just suppose that we chose option (a), to confirm our pathological behavior...

Then someday in the future we define Info-Packages "Foo" and "Bar".  I send them both in an INFO.  I get a 400 back.  Which one failed?  One of them could be a critical type, with app-level failure maybe even sent in upstream requests - but I got a 400 and no upstream request - it's possible the critical one didn't even get to the app layer, or it's the other package context that failed.  Hmm.

Or let's say we define an Info-Package "Foo", and for some reason we decide it's really important and needs a special SIP header for it too in the INFO request.  Like, oh, I don't know... a header called "User-to-User" to carry UUI data.  (I know, I have an active imagination!)  Which package would this header belong to?  I mean, my god there could be another future package which needs that same header too!  Would we create a "Header-ID" param and HID URL too??

I don't want to go this way at all.

I guess I could live with a 4xx - 6xx response being an implicit indication of failure of a INFO request, even it is caused by the application, rather than analysis at the SIP level.

As soon as you want detail of the failure, that has to be an application level information, and it has to be transferred as an INFO package body, and in my view that still has to go in another INFO request, and not in the response.

And for the Reason header proposal/suggestion below, any standards track RFC can define the usage of Reason in response, but to my mind this changes the semantics of the Reason header way beyond its original intention.

Keith

Keith,

OK, I am willing to give up on the Reason phrase.
We already have precedent (488) for a 4xx response indicating trouble 
with the content of a body. At the moment it seems to be specific to SDP.

The question is:
- can we use 488/606 to mean trouble with some other kind of body?
- or must we reserve 488/606 for SDP. If it is only for SDP:
   - can we have a different code to mean "other body trouble"?
   - or must we settle for 400 for this?

I'm willing to live with 400 if that is what others prefer.
I am ambivalent about generalizing 488.
Another code would be nice, but I think we will spin awhile getting 
agreement on it.

	Thanks,
	Paul

I think the 488 precedent was unfortunate. If you send SDP offer in a
reliable provisional response or a 2xx response, 488 isn't available to
you (except I suppose you could put a Reason header in the PRACK or ACK
request, but I don't really want to go there).

So I don't think we need we need a way of indicating in an INFO response
problems with body content in the request.  Let the application send an
INFO request in the reverse direction.

John

Dale,

For the Call pick up I was not referring to the headers in the SUBSCRIBE
but to the Event header specifically.

RFC 4235 which defines the dialog event requires that the dialog event
has the call-id and at least the to-tag for the dialog on which the
subscription is to act (RFC 4235 Section 3.3):

E.g.

Event: dialog;call-id=536829AF35;to-tag=98153284afer

I was asking if there has been any change to the dialog event definition
which allows you to SUBSCRIBE for all dialogs on a UA.

In the phones that I am familiar with, the first step of the
consultative transfer process (putting the first leg on hold) is done by
invoking a specific consultative transfer operation.  In this case, the
phone can annotate the INVITE of the second leg as being part of a
consultative transfer process.

I had not thought of the case were the phone was not aware that a
consultative transfer was in progress until after the second leg had
been established.  I suppose that in this case, we could rely on the
remaining messages in the consultative transfer process to carry the
dialog correlations (section 3.2):

   An attended transfer normally involves three different dialogs.  If
   the transfer completes, and the REFER that completes the transfer has
   a References header, the References header in the REFER and the
   Replaces header in the resulting INVITE will suffice to connect the
   three dialogs.

(Although that text is not correct:  The REFER does not need a
References header.  The INVITE starting the third (final) dialog will
contain a References header naming the leg that carried the REFER, and
it will also carry a Replaces header (derived from the Replaces
header-parameter in the Refer-To URI of the REFER) that names the other
leg.)

I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  The dialog event package will
be the body of the NOTIFY (F5), which is not illustrated.  The SUBSCRIBE
(F3) is illustrated with a Call-Id and from-tag.  (It has no to-tag
because it is out-of-dialog.)

I'm just wondering, if folks could help to explain me this:
apparently when I asked if people in the WG feel safe about
IETF's mechanisms deployable to prevent spoofed From, nobody
spoke up. At the same time, there were some who felt that
we don't have a problem statement. I would be thankful if
representatives of the latter group could share with me
what is the missing piece here to state a problem.

Thank you very much indeed,

-jiri

p.s. the other aspects such as B2BUA traversal is IMO very
orthogonal and is to be ellaborated on in a seprate document.

Thank you all very much,

[Ian Elz ] Thus it is only a proxy which is includes itself in the Path
header during registration which is allowed to insert a session-id. Does
a proxy in the Path header remember that it is part of the Path for the
subscriber?

[Ian Elz ] But having a proxy insert a session-id is not fixing
anything. I am not arguing against the session-id at this point just
allowing proxies to invent one and add then in the middle of a request.
Allowing the proxy to add a session-id requires that the proxy must be
included in the message sequence for the new request using the
session-id as a reference and it must also remember that it inserted the
session-id and map the session-id <--> call-id & tags from one side to
the other when they are used as a reference.

[Ian Elz ] If the session-id is only to be used for troubleshooting then
having a proxy insert the header is not an issue. If it is to be used in
place of the call-id and tags for use in the existing headers (Replaces,
Join, Target-dialog,...) of in Events (dialog etc) then there is an
issue.
I think that we need to define and limit the usage of this header.

[Ian Elz ] I am looking at this as a possible solution to the issue of
the mapping of the call-id and tags across B2BUAs and how the headers
and events listed above can be handled across B2BUAs. The current
situation where the B2BUA maps the call-id and or tags requires that the
referencing request is passed along the existing B2BUA chain to allow
the mapping of the previous dialog identifying parameters in the
referencing header. This requires that the B2BUA map the Contact if it
maps any of call-id, from-tag or to-tag and that the new request uses
the Contact from the previous dialog as the R-URI in the referencing
dialog.
In some network implementations there may be service requirements to
pass the referencing request along the B2BUA chain but that is for those
implementations to determine whether the session-id provides a suitable
solution.

Jiri,

It is well-known that I am not comfortable that we have a **deployable**
solution for preventing From URI spoofing. The reason it is not
deployable is because of B2BUAs, and to some extent because of
E.164-based URIs and the way they are handled in practice. Furthermore
there are issues with PSTN interworking, but we can't do much about
that. 

I have tried to articulate these issues by means of several I-Ds over
the last year or so, but capturing a "problem statement" acceptable to
all seems to be an elusive goal.

The reason seems to be that if I describe the problem in a certain way
(e.g., B2BUAs break the RFC 4474 signature), people say "but we can get
round this by doing A", so the problem statement has to be extended to
say why A doesn't work, and then people say "but you can get round it by
doing B", so the problem statement has to be further extended to say why
B will not work, and so on ad infinitum.

So I would welcome any other attempts to write the problem statement.

John

That is not true. The do-we-need-a-linkage question also apply to multipart in genral, e.g. where you do have only one info package body part, in addition to some other body parts.

The same could be said of 413, 415, 493, etc.  If the UAC can't fundamentally handle an INVITE response's body, it can send a CANCEL, with the Reason header.  I thought that was the point of the Reason header - to be able to send the failure reason in requests.

   "SIP responses already offer a means of informing the user of why a

That's not always technically possible, AFAICT.  If the body content is bad, there's no guarantee it even got to the app-layer.

Nope, that's just one example.  You said there was no way to make a Proxy be in the path for out-of-dialog requests, and I said sure there is.  You could also have a one-and-only Proxy for accepting requests from outside your domain, which could do the matching.  Or the Proxy could be the Registrar for your domain, which is always traversed to reach registered UAs.

Again, though - this is not about who can generate a Session-ID.  It's about who can do the matching.  Every hop can try to do matching for all I care.  It won't affect interoperability or add failure cases where previously there were success cases.  It's only at a MAY level - you don't have to do it if you don't want to.

Nope, it doesn't require that at all.  See the draft - it's at a MAY to do matching.
I think you may be reading something into the draft that it doesn't say: that only a Session-ID *generator* can do matching?  The draft doesn't say that, nor did I intend it if it does. :)  Should I put words in the draft making that clearer?

Hadriel,

If a proxy inserts a session-id then there will be two sides to the
initial request, the UAC side without the session-id and the UAS side
with a session-id. There may be a number of proxies and/or B2BUAs on
either side of the proxy which inserted the session-id.

When a later request comes from the UAS side which uses the inserted
session-id to reference another dialog which node is going to perform
the matching and modify the referencing header from using the session-id
to using the call-id and tags. The nodes on the UAS side of the
inserting proxy will have received a session-id and will have passed it
on. These nodes have no knowledge that the session-id was inserted in
the middle of the message sequence and hence have no requirement to
perform the matching. The nodes on the UAC side of the original dialog
will not recognize the session-id as it was not in the message and
cannot perform the matching.

The only node which 'knows' that the session-id was inserted was the
node which inserted it. If the session-id was in the original request
from the originating UAC then no matching should occur. To perform
matching in this case would be unproductive as it would introduce the
problem which the header is trying to overcome.

I think that if you are going to allow inserting then you will need a
mechanism that will ensure that the new message will be passed to the
node that can perform the matching, this is the node which inserted it.

If all the things, insertion, matching etc are MAY in the draft I am
beginning to wonder what the purpose of the header is. Perhaps the draft
and consideration of the session-id header should be passed to the
sipping wg to consider the requirements and what problems it is trying
to solve.

Which is why the SDP response should have been in a request sent back  
from terminating UA to originating UA, and not in an answer. But that  
cat and most of its relatives are out of the bag, at least for SIP  
2.0. Note for posterity: you can't fix a broken leg with a band-aid  
well enough for running on, but if you add enough band-aids, you just  
might make a squishy-sticky prosthetic that lets you limp along.

I concur. It might be reasonable for the SIP stack to send a 4xx  
response meaning "I have no idea what to do with this INFO body; I  
either don't understand it, or I have no application to hand it to".  
Beyond that, it just isn't SIP's job to express application semantics  
in a response code.

"the same Session-ID to be used for A-to-C" ... as is used for *what*?
Do you mean, "the same session-id to be used for the A-to-B and B-to-C
dialogs of the A-to-C session"?

[JRE] Jiri asked about problem statement, not solution.

[JRE] The word "may" is important here. Until we find an approach that is v=
iable (and I don't think we are quite there yet with DERIVE), it is difficu=
lt to tell whether a better-than-nothing approach would be worthwhile.

That's clear and unambiguous, since we assume that each dialog will have
only one session-id associated with it.

I think you're getting into a lot of trouble with this.  For one thing,
if a request forks, it creates multiple dialogs.  If the UAC inserted a
session-id, all those dialogs share the same session-id.  Previously,
that situation is disambiguated by identifying a dialog by giving
call-id/from-tag/to-tag.  But session-id alone is ambiguous, so it can't
be used to replace the current dialog identifiers.  And since we assume
that the tags will be changed by B2BUAs, session-id/from-tag/to-tag
won't work at all.

Even worse, at any B2BUA in a dialog, there are multiple dialogs that
share the session-id.  So an incoming INVITE/Replaces specifying a given
session-id is ambiguous unless the dialog-id is provided also.  This
means that if we allow INVITE/Replaces to specify a dialog only with
session-id (or if we allow Replaces to match if the session-id's match
but call-id's don't) we need to allow the recipient of INVITE/Replaces
to respond "matches more than one dialog here".

Here's another nasty case.  Reusing Paul's diagram:

                 |------ C
                 |
        A ------ B
                 |
                 |------ D

Let us suppose that A calls C, establishing two dialogs (A-B and B-C)
that share a session-id.  Now suppose that D executes a "call pickup"
operation by determining the dialog identifiers of the B-C leg and
sending an INVITE/Replaces toward A, or actually, A's avatar on the
interface of B that faces D.

If B passes the INVITE through to A, the Replaces is executed on A, and
nothing particularly strange happens.

But if B decides to short-circuit the INVITE/Replaces by continuing the
A-B dialog and reconnecting it with the new D-B dialog, what happens to
the session-id's?  A-B remains using the session-id sent by A in the
original INVITE, but B-D must continue using the session-id sent by D in
the INVITE/Replaces.  So the two "legs" of the A-D logical dialog will
be using different session-id's, contrary to the declared point of
session-id's.

[JRE] Jiri asked about problem statement, not solution.

[JRE] The word "may" is important here. Until we find an approach that is v=
iable (and I don't think we are quite there yet with DERIVE), it is difficu=
lt to tell whether a better-than-nothing approach would be worthwhile.

The impression I was left with from the draft was that a session-id
would be shared *only* by dialogs that "would be one dialog if the
B2BUAs were proxies".  That is, by dialogs that are logically all one
dialog, in terms of the media that are carried.

Now you're saying that a group of dialogs that are related in other ways
can also share a session-id.  I don't see any reference to that usage in
the draft's requirements (section 1.1) or use cases (section 1.2).

I think you need to clarify this or the discussion will be endlessly
confused.

Dale

Yup.

Nope.  The draft is pretty clear that a Proxy or B2BUA would only insert/generate it if and only if it did not already exist.

They have no requirement to do so - but that does not prevent them from doing so.

No, the header is not trying to overcome being "unproductive".  I don't dispute that it would be an unnecessary action to perform in some cases.  But again, note that it is not mandatory.  Matching does not introduce interop issues, and does not make it fail when it would have otherwise succeeded.  It's something a node can do if it wishes to.

Can you describe how you think that would be possible for a Session-ID mechanism to do?  Because I don't see a way for that to be possible, given the constraints.

The requirements are in the draft, as are the problems.  If you don't agree with them that's cool.  If you think they should be expanded or narrowed let me know.  I think you feel that the matching property is not a requirement, or that the solution to it in this doc is not to your liking. (Right?)  But you have not had any complaints with the troubleshooting property, AFAIK.

I see no need to go through bureaucratic procedural hoops which slow down the process of invention, when what they amount to is changing the email mailing list we use but are otherwise the same group of individuals. [no offense to the SIPPING WG, but I think that viewpoint was generally shared by attendees at the last IETF meeting's RAI meeting]

Henry,

Of course, as with any specs we produce, but until the spec is written (not=
 necessarily as an RFC) vendors can't implement it and the market can't the=
refore decide. All we can do in the IETF is assess whether we think it wort=
hwhile to devote resources to writing an RFC.

So let's define a "spoofed From."

Are we talking about a real UA generating an INVITE request with a  
bogus identity asserted in it's From: field, or are we talking about a  
DOS attack (like a voice-hammer generator) where a device that is not  
a UA is generating an INVITE request that causes the UAS to deliver  
the attack to the victim?


For the first threat, in our current spec family, we have strong  
identity (aka RFC 4474) as a general solution, and weak identity (RFC  
3325) as a point solution for single-domains or federations with  
identity enforcement points in trusted proxies.

For the second threat, we have null-authentication; the UAS can  
challenge the request (which tests direct return routability to the  
UAC) and wait for a response before proceeding to the alerting phase.  
By direct return routability, I mean that we can follow the via-stack  
back to the originating UAS (possibly with help for a via-pruning SBC).

So where does DERIVE fit in?

I believe it attempts to address both problems. It's clearly heavier  
than the existing solution for the second threat, but if we use  
DERIVE, we get this problem fixed for free. So the question of the  
work really seems to be its applicability to the first threat.

Let us move to an examination of the assumptions. DERIVE assumes that  
the identity expressed in the request being examined is a routable  
identity, and that there is a indirect return routability for that  
identity. By indirect return routability, I mean that a new  request  
targeted to that identity will reach the user agent that originated  
the request. Further, DERIVE assumes that the UA reached by the  
indirect return routability path has knowledge of the request being  
examined and that it can attest to that knowledge, thereby  
establishing the veracity of the identity expressed in the request to  
the level of "this identity resolves in the routing topology to the  
node that sent the request".

Therein lies the differentiator: Whereas RFC 4474 proves the identity  
cryptographically (that is, through secrets known to the identity- 
holder or to a trusted third party working on behalf of the identity- 
holder), DERIVE proves it functionally (by the definition of  
"functionally" meaning "it works", sorry you Haskell fans!).

Two questions remain:

1) Is a functional verification through indirect return routability  
testing of the identity expressed in a request actually useful?

2) Is the mechanism used by DERIVE reasonable for implementing an  
indirect return routability check?

Let's attack these one at a time.


Question 1: Usefulness of indirect request return-routability checks  
in SIP

Many attacks seen in the Internet rely on forged transmission  
identifiers. For example, consider the once wildly popular Smurf attack:

	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack

The Smurf attack uses a ICMP echo request with a forged IPsource  
address, where the victim's address is used as its source address  
(i.e, it's "From:"). This initial request is addressed to the  
broadcast address of a remote subnet. If the attack succeeds, each  
host on the remote subnet replies, thereby flooding the victim with  
unexpected ICMP echo request responses.

Although we have not identified a Smurf-like direct amplification  
attack in SIP, it's still obviously possible to use a forged From: to  
cause the victim's phone to ring, thereby making the target UA an  
attack amplifier against the person (or sanity) of the end user. One  
might call this the "ring ring ditch" or "ring ring ginger" attack,  
from the similar childish doorbell prank"

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock_down_ginger

DERIVE clearly reduces the opportunity to use a forged From: to bypass  
controls on the victim's phone. Not perfect, but it passes the script- 
kiddie test.


Consider however the SIP Voice Hammer attack:

	http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-19.txt, section 18.15.1

This works similarly to Smurf, but it uses a second level of  
indirection. Rather than spoofing the victim's From: address, Voice  
Hammer insert's the victim;s address into the SDP of a SIP INVITE.  
When the target of the request "answers" the call, the target becomes  
an amplifier, spewing RTP packets at the victim.

Indirect return routability testing gives us no direct defense here,  
in that provides some validation of the from: address but we have no  
way of correlating this address with the one used in the SDP. However,  
it does make it harder to originate the attack anonymously, as it  
requires that the attacker establish indirect return routability at  
the SIP level, which presumably gives us a little better chance of  
hunting the perpetrator down and apply other mechanisms (such as  
summary execution) in order to prevent further offenses.

In other words, it's good enough to stop script kiddies.

In a third attack scenario, presume the attacker's goal is to  
impersonate a caller, such as the infamous "Radio-Show Sarkozy/Palin"  
calls.
	
	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/01/masked-avengers-prank-cal_n_140023.html

Here the goal is not necessarily to prevent the call, but to give the  
called party some level of comfort as to the authenticity of the  
caller's expression of identity.

Indirect return routability checks clearly establish that the calling  
party is sufficiently in-control of the expressed identity as to be  
able to receive calls directed toward that identity. This is better  
than nothing; it can't prove identity, but it greatly decreases the  
probability of a random radio DJ being able to make a prank call.



Question 2: Does DERIVE provide a reasonable solution?

In order to impact the DoS attacks described in 1, the solution has to  
be "strong enough" that we can reasonably reject a call, at the  
automata level, without bothering the user. No arguments have been  
made that the mechanism in DERIVE is sufficiently widely deployed that  
one can reject calls not using it. One might argue that one could add  
an extension detection mechanism (such as including a modifier in the  
identity) that says "You can expect calls from me to support DERIVE;  
if they don't, it isn't me" that might help. But it's still a pretty  
weak defense against DoS. In the general case, DERIVE does NOT stop  
script kiddies from known DoS attacks, so it may not be useful here.

Consider however the "Radio-Show Sarkozy/Palin" calls; here the  
requirement is not to block the call entirely, but to give additional  
guidance to the user as to how to evaluate the caller's claimed  
identity. Here DERIVE might be useful. It's more use if we have a  
reason to believe that calls from a given party should support DERIVE.  
In the end, it comes down to breadth of availability. Will DERIVE be  
widespread enough that anybody bothers with it? My hunch is that this  
is unlikely, but this might be a useful point of discussion.

You mean "the Event header of a dialog event SUBSCRIBE".  A "dialog
event" (as people use the term) is the XML document described by RFC
4235.

> I was asking if there has been any change to the dialog event definition
> which allows you to SUBSCRIBE for all dialogs on a UA.

To the extent that "a UA" can be identified by a single contact URI, if
you send a SUBSCRIBE to that URI with the header "Event: dialog", then
you should receive dialog events that contain all dialogs that involve
that contact.

The problem is practice is "multi-line phones", where each line has a
different AOR and contact URI.  In that case, a SUBSCRIBE directed to
one contact URI receives dialog events for dialogs "on that one line".
There is no standardized mechanism for obtaining dialog events for all
dialogs active on a physical phone with multiple contact URIs.

No - read the (latest) draft.  The to-tag is in fact also used, to dis-ambiguate these things.  And I note that this would mean it can't be changed.  I'm on the fence whether to create a surrogate for that as well. (ugh)

Right, and this is why I said this is not some panacea solve-world-hunger thing.  And in fact why the Session-ID draft has language like "with as high a probability as possible".  I know it's not comfortable language for engineers.  But I am pretty sure there is no solution to this problem space that does not have corner cases. (well... unless you require changing all SIP devices everywhere, which for me is an unacceptable prerequisite)

But anyway, yes B-D has a different Session-ID from A-B, and that's ok.  Had D's INVITE/Replaces gone all the way back to A, then A-D would have ALSO been a new Session-ID.  B is acting as a stand-alone UA with respect to the new Session, and thus follows what I described previously in another email to Paul:
    "Basically, my assertion is that if you receive a SIP request from A as a UAS, and route or fork it to one or more targets (B/C/D) as a UAC, you have created a single dialog-set.  Let's assume it establishes with B.  IF you receive an in-dialog or dialog-referential request from A or B, and act upon that request as the UA without forwarding it back to A or B and the action creates another dialog, (e.g., you create a new INVITE), then I'd argue you're probably creating a new dialog-set; because that's what should have been created had it actually gone back to A or B and they'd created a new dialog.  But really I'd defer to other people's opinions on that."

Yes exactly.  The great thing about a DERIVE concept, or Dan's return-routability draft, is it doesn't require an RFC at all really.  There is no interoperability issue to be solved, and no changes to SIP, AFAICT.  No?
But if they want it to be a WG item then it has to argue its case just as all the others do.

Hi,

Chapter 15 of RFC3261 says:

"The caller's UA MAY send a BYE for either confirmed or early dialogs,
and the callee's UA MAY send a BYE on confirmed dialogs, but MUST NOT
send a BYE on early dialogs."

Chapter 5.1 of RFC3311 (UPDATE) says:

"The UPDATE request is constructed as would any other request within an
existing dialog, as described in Section 12.2.1 of RFC 3261.  It MAY be
sent for both early and confirmed dialogs, and MAY be sent by either
caller or callee."

RFC 2976 (INFO) mostly talks about "transfering of mid-session
information".

Chapter 4.1. of draft-ietf-sip-info-events-01.txt says:

 "One can only use the INFO method within an INVITE-generated dialog
(early or full) and usage."

I assume we want to allow INFO in both directions (from caller and
callee) during the early dialog, so would it be good to explicitly say
something similar to what is said for UPDATE?

Regards,

Christer

Actually, I would debate that.  Derive and other return-routability checks have the property of: "if I pass then you know I'm good, if I fail then you know nothing (neither good nor bad)".   I would argue such a property is only useful in voice communications if it passes and provides a positive/"good" result *frequently*.

For example, if the odds of Derive passing is low in general, then Palin would have had to assume it *was* Sarkozy even if it failed.  Why?  Because she assumes it now, with no such checking, and the odds of this thing passing are low per the supposition.

Therefore, if we feel the odds of a return-routability check succeeding is low in general, it is NOT the case that: "it greatly decreases the probability of a random radio DJ being able to make a prank call."

Ummmm... no it doesn't.  It stops me from attacking the intended target's phone *directly*, but not as a smurf-style attack.  I simply set my From: to the *target's* URI, then send that INVITE to every number I can.  Thus I get other devices to flood the target with SUBSCRIBEs.  It's not as annoying as ringing the target's phone, for sure, but it's still an attack.  And unlike SMURF or hammer attack, it only requires me to know the target's AoR, not its IP or MAC.  And unlike a direct INVITE attack, I don't even need authorization or a path to reach the intended target; I only need to be able to reach a lot of Derive-capable UA's and hope some of them can reach the intended target.

Excellent analysis of the context and applicability of DERIVE, Dean.  In
it, you wrote:

> identity, and that there is a indirect return routability for that  
> identity. By indirect return routability, I mean that a new  request

> node that sent the request".

There are two issues with these assumptions that I think are worth one
further level of analysis:

A From Address will often fail to reach the caller if used as a request
target.

        For DERIVE to work the "indirect return routability" test needs
        to reach the specific UA that originated the call whose
        authenticity is being checked.  In environments with any kind of
        gateway, this will often not be the case.  If I'm calling from a
        non-SIP environment into SIP, even if that translation
        accurately preserves my identity as a From address (for example,
        my PSTN carrier provides a valid caller-id which then is
        accurately translated to a From header), that address is often
        not going to have the property that it is sure to route back to
        the very same gateway that the INVITE came from.  What's more,
        there's no other reason why it should - an AOR is an identifier,
        not a route description.
        
SUBSCRIBE is not INVITE

        It is by no means assured that a SUBSCRIBE request will be
        routed to the same set of UAs that an INVITE would be.  In
        particular, a SUBSCRIBE coming from outside the callers domain
        may often be subject to policy based routing or rejected without
        ever reaching the UA of even a legitimate caller.

These factors are the ones that I was referring to in the Minneapolis
meeting when I said that a DERIVE-based test would have a high
false-alarm rate - that is, that the indirect return routability test
would fail even for a legitimate caller with a legitimate From address.
I believe this rate would be so high that it would certainly be unsuited
to any automated filtering - the best it could do would be to offer a
user-interface indication of failure at call presentation time.  Even in
that case, it would indicate an unverified caller so often that the
callee would be unwise to make any firm judgment based on it, so the
callee is in exactly the position they are in today - the From address
is a hint.

Right - this was the same issue people had with Dan's return-routability test.

Correct - this was noted in an earlier email on this topic a few weeks ago as well.
It's actually worse than that, BTW.  We've already noted that the UAC would in fact have to support the dialog-event package; as would every b2bua in the middle that changed a call-id, and you'd have to hit all those same b2bua's.
These all reduce the probability of a positive check result. (for some of us fairly drastically)

Exactly - that was my point about the Palin/Sarkozy problem not really being resolved.

I agree but I don't think that's the point. Remember that DERIVE is 
about the
positive test, the negative tests are worthless. In other words this is 
about
the migration path and not about the starting point (every single 
extension takes
some new lines of  code, without which there is 0% deployment). 
Importantly, while
DERIVE grows, the worthless share declines and reinforces the value of 
the positive
share.

The point is the *positive* case.
I bet I can name you 10 reasons why the negative case can occur but I'm not
interested the negative case. (it is not "false positive", it is
worthless zero-bit-long piece of information).

Why are you exactly interested in studying the negative case when it is
obviously without value?

;) We clearly all have different definitions for the KISS principle,
which is probably natural.

We also seem to have different definitions for the scope of what we are
supposed to do as part of this WG item, which is also natural - at least
in SIP :)

>Let's imagine, for sake of argument, that the solution to the general
SIP message problem of dis-ambiguating body parts which don't belong to
the message context, were to be solved by creating a CID for 
>all the body-parts that *did* belong to the message context.  I think
that would be incredibly foolish, maybe even pathological, but let's
just pretend that we decided it was the right solution... (nice

>Then someday in the future we define Info-Packages "Foo" and "Bar".  I
send them both in an INFO.  I get a 400 back.  Which one failed?  One of
them could be a critical type, with app-level failure maybe 
>even sent in upstream requests - but I got a 400 and no upstream
request - it's possible the critical one didn't even get to the app
layer, or it's the other package context that failed.  Hmm.

We already have that problem today. A specific SIP request can "fail"
due to many reasons (not only related to message bodies), but we are
only allowed to send one single response code back.

>Or let's say we define an Info-Package "Foo", and for some reason we
decide it's really important and needs a special SIP header for it too
in the INFO request.  Like, oh, I don't know... a header called 
>"User-to-User" to carry UUI data.  (I know, I have an active
imagination!)  Which package would this header belong to?  I mean, my
god there could be another future package which needs that same header 
>too!  Would we create a "Header-ID" param and HID URL too??

Is this really a problem for non-INFO message bodies? There is no CID
for SDP, but clients seem to be able to deal with it anyway. 

Because, in most cases today clients are able to find out what is in a
message body, and what to do with it, based on the Content-Type value.

There are multiple usages of XML message bodies, but even in all of
those cases I think the Content-Type value gives more information than
simply saying "XML".

So, something like "Content-Type: application/info+foo" would solve
this. No need for new headers, no need for CIDs, no need for nothing...
That is MY definition of KISS (apart from being one of the coolest rock
band :)

I hear Paul's argument that people may want to used the same C-T value
as they use for legacy INFO today, but I really see no problem in using
something else. They can still use exactly the same data content.

Regards,

Christer

Hi Christer,
I think there is general consensus that this problem is not unique to INFO, and is in fact applicable to all message types, so we should be discussing this in the other thread for that purpose.  I will respond to your comments in that one, just to be consistent.

Well, if you had previously told me that you should always pass RRC  
and then fail, I might assume the caller isn't you.

But in general, you're confounding the second part of my analysis with  
the first, so keep reading . . .

There is no CID, but there is a C-D: an implicit C-D of "session" for app/sdp, and "render" for everything else.  And I am not at all advocating that we use CID for the body-parts that actually belong to the message context.  Quite the contrary, I think it would be silly to do that.

And yes it is a potential problem for non-INFO message bodies, in exactly the same way it's a potential problem for INFO.  There is nothing unique about INFO which makes the problem only applicable to it.

To reiterate the "problem": the issue is not that messages can have multiple body-parts.  The issue is that one or more body-parts may not actually be intended for the message's context.  In other words, they're not intended for the application-layer processing logic specific to that method (and package if there is one).  For example, when I send a SUBSCRIBE request, the method name "SUBSCRIBE" and the Event header package name identify a specific context -  a specific use-case of the message with its own set of rules and for a specific application-layer above, which actually understands that package's specific semantics and how to process the higher-level "subscription".

So if the SIP message has body-parts, and one of them is actually not intended for that package but is instead just a generic add-on, like geoloc for example, we need to dis-ambiguate that add-on body-part(s) from the others.

For one thing, we don't need to change ANY C-* in the INFO message and still get what we want - if that's not "simple" then I don't know what is.  :)

It is also debatable that having a solution for a specific message type and then a different solution for other message types is "simple"; or even having a body "type" that is unique for each message type vs. generic to all is "simple".  It may be simpler for the first message type you do it to, but then you have to reproduce that code for all message types anyway.

No, that may be what some of them do in code, or what it appears like they're doing from a wireshark trace, but what 3261 says is that in fact there is a C-D that extends the C-T.  It just happens to be that "session" is the implicit C-D for "application/sdp", and "render" is the implicit C-D for everything else.  So as far as we know they're actually doing it right.

BTW, it's not that I disagree with you that content-types to date have been unambiguous in reality.  They have, afaik.  And I think we would be well-advised to keep future extensions from re-using already defined C-T's if ambiguity could occur.  For most things we're pretty safe.  For example, any future Info package would be safe to re-use existing C-T's, because a negotiation mechanism is in place to indicate package support, so you wouldn't get a message with the package to begin with if you didn't understand it and support disambiguating body parts.

Hi,

Sure. But, assume we would also be using SDPng. It would also have a C-D
value of "session", but I assume the C-T value would be different than
"app/sdp". You need to know what is in the body, so you can process and
parse it correctly.

It should be defined in what SIP messages geoloc information may be
transported, and what the receiver supporting it is supposed to do with
it. As we do for SDP. SDP in CANCEL has no meaning, for example, so it
is seen as a protocol error to send SDP in CANCEL.

I see no reason why we should solve things so that one can insert
whatever, wherever...

And, as far as INFO is concerned, I guess we all agree that info
packages are within the context of INFOs. BUT, you still need to know
body part(s) contain info package bodies, and what info package is
containded in a specific body part. C-T can do that, as it does for XML.

Christer

Hi,

nothing...
>>That is MY definition of KISS (apart from being one of the coolest

>For one thing, we don't need to change ANY C-* in the INFO message and
still get what we want - if that's not "simple" then I don't know what
is.  :)
>
>It is also debatable that having a solution for a specific message type
and then a different solution for other message types is "simple"; or
even having a body "type" that is unique for each message 
>type vs. generic to all is "simple".  It may be simpler for the first
message type you do it to, but then you have to reproduce that code for
all message types anyway.

If we have a package specific C-T value we probably don't even need the
Info-Package header. So, absolutely no reason to link a header with a
body part, because there is no header. Just like SDP.

We use Send-Info to negotiate that we support foo, and then I send you
foo with C-T: application/info+foo. Very simple.

If people then want to define some generic SIP mechanism for some
problem I am not sure we all agree what it is, fine. If needed, you can
then use that solution also for your info package body parts.

>>Because, in most cases today clients are able to find out what is in a
message body, and what to do with it, based on the Content-Type value.

>No, that may be what some of them do in code, or what it appears like
they're doing from a wireshark trace, but what 3261 says is that in fact
there is a C-D that extends the C-T.  It just happens to be 
>that "session" is the implicit C-D for "application/sdp", and "render"
is the implicit C-D for everything else.  So as far as we know they're
actually doing it right.

In my experience, the problem is not "context", because it is know what
information is sent in what message. In addition, C-T (together with C-D
if you like) tells you what a body part contains, so you can process and
parse the message. There is no need to link any CIDs between SIP headers
and body parts in order to figure out what to do.

So, by using C-T for info packages it will work ecactly the same way for
INFO. I look at C-T, and I process and parse the info package body part.
Simple.

>BTW, it's not that I disagree with you that content-types to date have

pretty safe.  For example, any future Info package would be safe to

the package to begin with if you didn't understand it and support
disambiguating body parts.

I just think it is very useful and simple to able to look at the C-T
value in order to figure out what is in the body part...

Christer

Geoloc may be transported in any SIP request, afaik - except ACK and CANCEL.  Putting a body in any/all messages which is not for the context of the message is not without precedent, I've been told.  Maybe this is just the first time that we really expect it to be used? :)

A content type of "application/sdp" can be used in any request that can carry mime bodies as far as I know.  It just wouldn't make sense to make it's C-D "session" in anything but INVITE, ACK, PRACK, and UPDATE; and for the SUB/NOT/PUB you'd have to define a package for using it.

BTW, CANCEL can't carry any body, afaict, if for no other reason than the Content-* headers needed to do so can't be used in CANCEL. (nor would we want it to be able to, for obvious reasons)

Of course, but the C-T helps you determine exactly what you just described: the parsing of it.  Not the parsing of the SIP message, but the parsing of that specific body part's content; and not the purpose of that body part either - that's C-D essentially.  The SIP stack may have no idea how that content is parsed whatsoever.  All it needs to know is what upper-layer logic to pass it up to.  We're not preventing an integrated stack from processing it all at once - we're just continuing to allow a layered stack to separate it out.

So let's take the SDPng example - let's ignore that INVITE basically has special handling of session descriptions in particular, and is generally "special" in SIP for lots of things, which make the example not really applicable for the discussion.  So instead assume it's possible to handle it exactly as other messages could handle their body parts.

Just the C-D of "session" tells the SIP stack the body-part's purpose/semantic is to describe a session.  It could actually stop right there, and pass it up to a common process which handles all session descriptions, which would figure out how to parse an "application/sdpng".  Or the stack could have information about what formats the process can handle, which are just opaque strings to it, and thus determine that "application/sdpng" is not a type the process can handle and reject it right then.  Or the stack could even know how the content handled by the app process should be formatted, and reject them if they're not right.  Or the session description handling could be completely integrated into the stack.

But C-T does NOT do that for XML.  I can use an application/pidf+xml for any number of things.  The C-D tells me the semantic purpose of it.  I.e., what to do with it.
And again, a "package" is NOT contained in a body part.  A package may define body part content-types to use, or none at all.
The way you can know what body-parts are for the package is by those body-parts that have a C-D of "render" (unless the package defines a specific C-D value).  And since "render" is implicit/default, you don't even need to include C-D in the message.  Neat and tidy. :)

This is just rehashing the discussion from many months ago on this list about doing use-specific content-types which drove us to the package header to begin with.  Please don't make us go there again! (pretty-please!)

What does it matter to you where the package identifier is, in C-T vs. Info-Package?  Most of us feel it's a lot cleaner to keep them separate, and to put the package identifier in a SIP header vs. a MIME one.

Fine, let's keep them separate.

This is just rehashing the discussion from many months ago on this list
about doing use-specific content-types which drove us to the package
header to begin with.  Please don't make us go there again!
(pretty-please!)

What does it matter to you where the package identifier is, in C-T vs.
Info-Package?  Most of us feel it's a lot cleaner to keep them separate,
and to put the package identifier in a SIP header vs. a MIME one.

So, there is no problem then. Let's move on.

Ok,

Before you reply to my other e-mail related to INFO and multipart,
please read this proposal first:

1. We only allow a single info package per INFO message (I know that I
am the main reason that we are still discussing this, but I am willing
to give in in order to progress).

2. The info package description defines the "context", ie what SIP
headers and/or body parts (including C-T values for those body parts)
are associated with a specific info package.

   - NOTE: I assume that a SINGLE info package could specify the usage
of MULTIPLE body parts. Correct?

3. If someone adds additional body parts (e.g. geoloc) to an INFO
request, which is outside the context of the specific info package for
the INFO, it is outside the scope of the info package description (and
the info event specification) to define how it is handled (in the case
of geoloc, the geoloc description should describe how it is used, and
where it is used).

4. We remove all text about CID from the the Info event draft. Whoever
wants to work with that - write a separate draft.

I believe this should at least be alligned with Hadriel's ideas, right?

Regards,

Christer

If the body content is bad, in the sense that the UA does not support
it, can't parse it etc, one should be allowed to send a 4xx response -
like for any other SIP request (well, not for PRACK, but we're trying to
fix that :).

BUT, if the body is used for my chess application, and I am trying to
make a chess move which is not allowed, that should not be mapped into a
SIP response code. Instead an INFO should be sent back, indicating the
error.

Regards,

Christer

Hi,

I agree with Dean. The SIP stack should be allowed to send 4xx in order
to say "call does not exist", "I don't support this content-type", "I
don't support this info package" etc.

But, we should not try to map specific info package application level
errors into SIP response codes.

Regards,

Christer

Which is why the SDP response should have been in a request sent back
from terminating UA to originating UA, and not in an answer. But that
cat and most of its relatives are out of the bag, at least for SIP 2.0.
Note for posterity: you can't fix a broken leg with a band-aid well
enough for running on, but if you add enough band-aids, you just might
make a squishy-sticky prosthetic that lets you limp along.

I concur. It might be reasonable for the SIP stack to send a 4xx
response meaning "I have no idea what to do with this INFO body; I
either don't understand it, or I have no application to hand it to".  
Beyond that, it just isn't SIP's job to express application semantics in
a response code.

Everyone seems to think there needs to be a generic way of identifying  
body bits.

I do not see an obvious, generic way of doing this.

Thus for those out there who think there is a generic way of  
identifying body parts for SIP, please write text.

*IF* we were to do multiple Info Packages in an INFO request, then the  
UAC is SOL if one package succeeds and another fails. That is the  
current text.

HOWEVER, I thought consensus was one Info Package per INFO request.

BTW, 20 pages for INFO is OK, as most of the text is a dissertation on  
why we are doing what we are doing. Remember, this is the merge of not  
one, not two, but THREE documents. Get over it ;-)

You know, we just passed 300 messages on THIS version of the INFO  
draft. I was going to wait for the traffic to die down before doing  
the next revision. Wonder when that will be? Soon, I hope.

I haven't chimed in yet, but I too cannot see why this debate continues.
As someone whosedone lots of SW development in the past, I see the
complexity of more than one INFO package per request to introduce far
more potential for complexity than "One INFO package per INFO request".
It seems to be an extremely small minority that seems to think the added
complexity is worth saving some messages. 

I agree there may be some interfaces over which saving bits is very
important - in that case, in the past, I've done "message bundling" by
including more than one message across the wire at one time. BUT, that
was done at a lower layer, entirely transparent to the S/W that
generates the basic messages. ISTM that the burden should be on the
interfaces with the limitations rather than across the board for all
usages of INFO packages - i.e., I don't see this at all to be an INFO
package issue. That all said, if there is some correlation/coupling of
the two packages by the application, then perhaps you should define a
single new package that combines the information - it seems then that
the implementation would be significantly simpler.   

Mary.

Subject: Re: [Sip] INFO Framework - one pakage per INFO

*IF* we were to do multiple Info Packages in an INFO request, then the
UAC is SOL if one package succeeds and another fails. That is the
current text.

HOWEVER, I thought consensus was one Info Package per INFO request.

BTW, 20 pages for INFO is OK, as most of the text is a dissertation on
why we are doing what we are doing. Remember, this is the merge of not
one, not two, but THREE documents. Get over it ;-)

You know, we just passed 300 messages on THIS version of the INFO draft.
I was going to wait for the traffic to die down before doing the next
revision. Wonder when that will be? Soon, I hope.

Yes exactly.
My idea was to essentially align it with how Event-packages are syntactical=
ly and semantically done for SUB/NOT/PUB.
They're different namespaces, but essentially "Info-Package:" is INFO's ver=
sion of "Event:".

Ok,

Before you reply to my other e-mail related to INFO and multipart, please r=
ead this proposal first:

1. We only allow a single info package per INFO message (I know that I am t=
he main reason that we are still discussing this, but I am willing to give =
in in order to progress).

2. The info package description defines the "context", ie what SIP headers =
and/or body parts (including C-T values for those body parts) are associate=
d with a specific info package.

   - NOTE: I assume that a SINGLE info package could specify the usage of M=
ULTIPLE body parts. Correct?

3. If someone adds additional body parts (e.g. geoloc) to an INFO request, =
which is outside the context of the specific info package for the INFO, it =
is outside the scope of the info package description (and the info event sp=
ecification) to define how it is handled (in the case of geoloc, the geoloc=
 description should describe how it is used, and where it is used).

4. We remove all text about CID from the the Info event draft. Whoever want=
s to work with that - write a separate draft.

I believe this should at least be alligned with Hadriel's ideas, right?

Regards,

Christer

Right, that's what we said when people asked how to do two things that really have co-dependence and cannot be separated because they're not atomic actions.  Just define a package that has both of those things in it.  A "molecule" so to speak. :)

There's no reason a single package can't have multiple body-parts, for example.  Just like SUB/NOT/PUB packages can.

I'm ok with it (I am hardly in a position to complain about verbosity).  But I do think some of the current text belongs in an appendix, not the main section.  But that's just an editorial comment and we can do that later once we agree on the basics. :)

Hi,

Please take a look at the "read this first" mail I sent. At least I am
ok with one package per INFO, assuming we remove all the CID stuff from
the draft, and that a single package can have multiple body-parts.

Regards,

Christer

Right, that's what we said when people asked how to do two things that
really have co-dependence and cannot be separated because they're not
atomic actions.  Just define a package that has both of those things in
it.  A "molecule" so to speak. :)

There's no reason a single package can't have multiple body-parts, for
example.  Just like SUB/NOT/PUB packages can.

Yes, I saw Hadriel's response and realized I had missed that one - for
most folks the volume of emails flying by on this topic has been too
much to keep up. So, sorry if what I said might have been redundant, but
it at least adds another view to the ping pong match. 

Mary.

Hi,

Somewhere in the small thread about multiple packages in an INFO there
have been statements that a body part associated with an INFO package
must have a Content-Disposition "render" value.

However, when reading RFC 3204 (MIME for ISUP/QSIG) it says that the C-D
value is "signal".

So, if we want to define an info package for ISUP transport I guess we
would have to allow "signal", because I don't think we want to update
3204...

Regards,

Christer

I think the body-handling draft already does it, although maybe I'm reading into it what I want to and not what it really says.

You asked, so this email is long.  This is what I think is the way to do it...

:Executive summary: basically we let C-D of "render" mean render to the specific context of the message; we mandate future extensions which are not for that context disambiguate themselves, by not using a C-D of "render" or the other ones already in use, and that they can't use a C-T already used today either. (and that includes changing geoloc's C-T immediately)

:The Details:

Definitions:
User-context = the specific context defined by the method name, and package if it's a method which has a package sub-context (SUB/NOT/PUB/INF).  The target user is the user-context's app-layer.  For example an "application/dtmf-relay" body-part would want to be targeted to the user-context defined by the "dtmf" package in an INFO.

Method-only-context = the context defined by the method name alone, ignoring any package.  The target is the specific message processor/state-machine for that method, but for any/all packages/sub-contexts.  For example the Event and Subscription-State headers are for this context in a SUBSCRIBE.  For methods that don't have a package (INV/UPD/ACK/PRA/MSG), the method-only-context and user-context are the same.  So the "session" and "early-session" C-D's are really for a user-context, but it's the same context as method-only-context.  I don't know of any bodies which are currently only for a method-only-context.(?)  Nor am I convinced we even need this context to be defined separately.

All-messages-context = the context is just the SIP message processing rules common to all messages.  The target is the SIP message processor common to all SIP messages.  The mandatory SIP headers (Call-ID, To, From, etc.) are examples of things targeted for this context.  An AIB, geoloc, and maybe sipfrag(?) bodies are targets for this context.

Note on above: If you think of this as a layered model with an API, or better yet a class object model - basically the all-messages-context is for things needing to be handled/extracted in the base SIP message class, the method-only-context is for stuff to be handled in a derived class for a given method, and the user-context is for stuff to be handled by a derived class from that for a given package, which may just be the same class for some methods (INV/UPD/etc.).

Rules:
1) Any body-part with a C-D of "render", means to render it to the "user" - not the human user, but the *user-context*.  This lets us get backwards-compatibility for free, because a C-D of "render" is implicit and what current SIP messages actually have and UA's expect.  That C-D becomes the "default" so to speak, which it already is today.

2) Any package (event of info) can define additional C-D's that belong to it, just like they can define C-T's that they support.  I am not entirely thrilled with letting packages define C-D's, but some already do ("signal", for example).  If we'd rather just grandfather those and say no more that's fine.  ISTM that a package could get that semantic purpose information from within the boy content itself (in XML, for example) if it really needs such.  Methods already do too, like "session" or "early-session".  If we decide packages can have their own C-D's, then we need additional rules not to step on body parts for others, but I'll skip that for now.

3) Any body-part that is NOT for the user-context, for example a geoloc, needs to disambiguate itself from the rest, by using a C-D other than "render" or the ones already defined.  If it needs a sub-context other than the all-messages-context, or is in fact tied to a SIP header, then it needs to use CID, and a C-D of "by-reference".  I would in fact suggest that all future extensions which need to be for something other than the user-context MUST have a referencing SIP header and use a CID and a C-D of by-reference.

4) Furthermore, any future extension which is not for the user-context MUST NOT use any C-T currently defined in any RFC or WG draft for SIP, including already defined event-packages.  That sounds harsh, but that's what we need to do to get a very high degree of backwards-compatibility I think.  So this means you can't do a geoloc-type thing using "text/plain", for example, or really even "application/pidf+xml", which is what geoloc currently uses in its draft.  And body-handling or some other draft should list all such C-T's, so future extensions can know the list to avoid.  And if we want to just say no C-T currently define by IANA period, I'm fine with that too.  Note this does NOT prevent future SIP RFCs from using a C-T defined by such an extension as geoloc.  For example, if geoloc uses "application/foobar", then a future Event-package could use that too; because that future event package would normatively reference body-handling.

5) IF we need an option tag (and I do NOT think we do), then we should create one and only one tag right now, for the body-handling draft's logic.  Future extensions which are not for the user-context would then NOT need more option tags simply due to body-handling issues, but can use that generic one.  I would also put in some extreme language into the body-handling option tag about what it means to put such a thing in a Require header, to dissuade people from doing that.

6) If there are some already defined things which do not follow the above rules, we either (a) grandfather them into body-handling right now, or if they're not really in use, then either (b) deprecate or (c) replace them. (and I would vote for (b), fwiw)

Yeah I said in one of those emails that the default is "render", but the pa=
ckage could define it's own C-D's it supports, specifically due to the "sig=
nal" case.  Or we could just grandfather that one and say no more unique C-=
D's for packages.

Subject: [Sip] INFO event package: C-D value always "render"?



Hi,

Somewhere in the small thread about multiple packages in an INFO there have=
 been statements that a body part associated with an INFO package must have=
 a Content-Disposition "render" value.

However, when reading RFC 3204 (MIME for ISUP/QSIG) it says that the C-D va=
lue is "signal".

So, if we want to define an info package for ISUP transport I guess we woul=
d have to allow "signal", because I don't think we want to update 3204...

Regards,

Christer

But B2BUAs now change to-tags, so we don't have the "works in most
current deployments" condition.  Also, to-tags may have the same problem
as call-ids, namely that they reveal the manufacturer of the originating
UA.  I think the mechanism needs to be revised to deal with this.

I'm losing track of what problem you're attempting to solve.  I thought
the problem was to identify the dialog-sets that are created by "B2BUA
pass-through".  But now it seems that the mechanism only identifies some
of these dialog-sets and doesn't identify others, because any
short-circuiting of INVITE/Replaces (and possibly other call-control
operations) defeats the mechanism.  There's also a problem with using
Session-Id to identify dialogs, as to-tag mangling is not compensated
for.

It seems that the only case that is well-handled is the simplest
PSTN-like call:  A UAC sends an INVITE that does not fork through a
B2BUA to a UAS.

On the contrary - it handles forks just fine.  The cases it doesn't "handle" are of two types: (1) not all parties which need to support Session-ID in a given scenario do in fact support it, and (2) when a new dialog is created such that it would have used a new Call-ID even if everything was a proxy and there were only a UAC and UAS.

I would argue case (1) is true for any mechanism we define.  I have yet to see a proposal that does not require more than one party supporting the new mechanism for it to work in all scenarios.  And I'm arguing THAT'S OK.  It's perfectly reasonable that whatever mechanism gets used only works if the parties that need to support it do.  What's important, for me at least, is that when the mechanism doesn't work it doesn't make things worse - i.e., it doesn't cause a failure when previously just Call-ID+tags would have succeeded.  I say that because, at least for me, the idea that we can get all devices to upgrade to whatever mechanism we pick on a flag-day is laughable.  It ain't gonna happen.  So we have to play the cards we're dealt.

For case (2), the gist of it is that Session-ID is essentially a new surrogate for Call-ID.  So if a UAC creates an out-of-dialog request, it would create a new Session-ID, just as it would create a new Call-ID.  When a B2BUA acts on behalf of a UA, such that it creates an out-of-dialog request which that UA would have itself created had the B2BUA not intercepted a message bound for that UA, then the Session-ID it creates would be a new one - again, because the Call-ID itself would have been a new one had the B2BUA not been involved.  For example, if the UAS sends an in-dialog REFER to the B2BUA, and the B2BUA "short-circuits" it and processes it on behalf of the UAC, and creates a brand new INVITE to the referred-to party, then it gets a new Session-ID, because if it had let that REFER go back to the UAC that's exactly what the UAC would have done.  I'm perfectly fine with that.  The original "session" is over, and a new one has been created.  That B2BUA is acting as more than a "dialog-proxy" at that instant.

But if you and others feel that it in fact needs to remain the same contiguous "session" even in that case, I'll change it.  I think it adds complexity, and more devices would have to support the mechanism than otherwise, but that's ok.  Though I still don't think we'd need to support a conference scenario (a scenario where multiple UAC's connect to a conference bridge).

Yeah, I've been on the fence about that as I said.  I loathe adding complexity, but I admit it is probably justified for tags.

I wonder if we really need the from-tag at all for this type of thing.  Forget for the moment about any of this and just think of the current Call-ID and tags, and assume there were no B2BUA's.  Is there ever a case where a UAC would generate a request with the same Call-ID as a previous request, but a different from-tag?  The to-tag we needed to identify forked responders generating unique early-dialogs with a common Call-ID, but why did we need the UAC to generate a from-tag? (I'm feeling dumb that I can't figure out the answer)

I have a doubt related to an Event header of PUBLISH in RFC5360.

RFC3903 says
4.1.  Identification of Published Event State
   For determining the type of the published event state, the EPA MUST
   include a single Event header field in PUBLISH requests.

But RFC5360 doesn't describe an event package of PUBLISH requests.

Indeed, the Event header is meaningless in this case, but this
header is mandatory.

Regards,
Shinji

[JRE] The number of negatives will diminish, true, but it will never
approach zero, because there will always be negative cases arising from
forking, call forwarding, problematic B2BUAs, etc.. So it is a question
whether it will get sufficiently close to zero that the odd false
negative can safely be ignored. I am rather doubtful.

Good point. I knew it defined that disposition, but didn't remember it 
used it in INFO. But since it makes it the default disposition for the 
type, I guess it probably would be used for INFO.

That's not strictly true. When the new package was defined it could 
specify that "render" be used for INFO even if "signal" is used when 
sending the same body in an INVITE.

But frankly there is no benefit to defining a package for this use, over 
just continuing with the legacy usage. That's because the usage also 
includes sending the same bodies in INVITE, etc. So the negotiation 
mechanism comes to late to add any value.

But I will respond to the general point in response to another of your 
messages.

	Thanks,
	Paul

The question remains: why would like to worry about the negative case
when we know it has zero information value?? I cannot conceive anyone
would like to use such non-information and I don't see the point in
studying it then.

Hadriel,

There is good stuff in here. I've been trying to say some (not all) of 
the same things, but haven't done as good of a job of it.

I'll also observe that this is the discussion I was hoping would come 
out around the body-handling draft. I guess it was too abstract then, 
and took a specific use case to get people thinking about it.

More (a lot more) inline...

>

The target is the specific message processor/state-machine for that method, but for any/all packages/sub-contexts.  For example the Event and Subscription-State headers are for this context in a SUBSCRIBE.  For methods that don't have a package (INV/UPD/ACK/PRA/MSG), the method-only-context and user-context are the same.  So the "session" and "early-session" C-D's are really for a user-context, but it's the same context as method-only-context.  I don't know of any bodies which are currently only for a method-only-context.(?)  Nor am I convinced we even need this context to be defined separately.

> All-messages-context = the context is just the SIP message processing rules common to all messages.  The target is the SIP message processor common to all SIP messages.  The mandatory SIP headers (Call-ID, To, From, etc.) are examples of things targeted for this context.  An AIB, geoloc, and maybe sipfrag(?) bodies are targets for this context.

I think this teasing apart of various processing contexts is very 
useful. It may need some tweaking, but certainly seems on the right 
track, and maybe well town the track. This is really an extension to the 
architectural model of sip, and we shouldn't discount its importance.

The C-Ds of "session" and "early-session" are unusual in that they can 
appear in a number of requests and responses. I guess these *could* be 
defned as user-context, or method-only-context, or all-messages-context. 
(Regardless of which context they are associated with, there need to be 
some special rules for how they can be used.)

Note that all of these can be in responses. Yet in the INFO case we 
aren't allowing use in responses. So again I think we have a *general* 
mechanism that may be used in requests and responses, and potentially 
special restrictions that are applied to particular cases.

There is another ugly special case that hasn't been mentioned: multipart 
bodies themselves. At least an outermost multipart/mixed needs to be 
handled as all-messages-context *by default* for backward compatibility. 
That means when it is C-D of "render", since that is the default for it.

I guess a multipart/mixed that has some other C-D need not be treated 
that way. E.g. there could be one with C-D of "by-reference", and some 
header that references it. But maybe that needs to be forbidden to 
ensure some existing app doesn't misinterpret it. But if it were 
forbidden, I don't know what someone would do if that is what they need.

> Note on above: If you think of this as a layered model with an API, or better yet a class object model - basically the all-messages-context is for things needing to be handled/extracted in the base SIP message class, the method-only-context is for stuff to be handled in a derived class for a given method, and the user-context is for stuff to be handled by a derived class from that for a given package, which may just be the same class for some methods (INV/UPD/etc.).
> 
> Rules:
> 1) Any body-part with a C-D of "render", means to render it to the "user" - not the human user, but the *user-context*.  This lets us get backwards-compatibility for free, because a C-D of "render" is implicit and what current SIP messages actually have and UA's expect.  That C-D becomes the "default" so to speak, which it already is today.

This seems right, at least for *outer* body parts. Once you get inside a 
multipart whose handling has already been determined by a C-D at that 
outer level, I'm not certain what to do with C-Ds that appear on the 
contained parts.

> 2) Any package (event of info) can define additional C-D's that belong to it, just like they can define C-T's that they support.  I am not entirely thrilled with letting packages define C-D's, but some already do ("signal", for example).  If we'd rather just grandfather those and say no more that's fine.  ISTM that a package could get that semantic purpose information from within the boy content itself (in XML, for example) if it really needs such.  Methods already do too, like "session" or "early-session".  If we decide packages can have their own C-D's, then we need additional rules not to step on body parts for others, but I'll skip that for now.

This seems to be building on Christer's proposal. Up to a point I think 
its probably ok. I was thinking that we didn't need to go this far, but 
maybe we do.

The notion of C-D is not unique to SIP, so there are C-D types out there 
that say nothing about their relationship to SIP. And of course there 
are C-Ds that we will define as being associated with the method-only or 
all-messages contexts.

So, I think a new C-D could be defined for use with a particular 
package. But to do so it would, I think, require an RFC. (Whatever the 
rules are for new C-D types.) Since we aren't going to require an RFC 
for info-packages, an info-package that needs a new C-D would still need 
an RFC. I also think an info-package could potentially specify that a 
particular (existing) C-D be associated with its user-context - as long 
as that C-D isn't associated with a message- or all-messages- context.

> 3) Any body-part that is NOT for the user-context, for example a geoloc, needs to disambiguate itself from the rest, by using a C-D other than "render" or the ones already defined.  If it needs a sub-context other than the all-messages-context, or is in fact tied to a SIP header, then it needs to use CID, and a C-D of "by-reference".  I would in fact suggest that all future extensions which need to be for something other than the user-context MUST have a referencing SIP header and use a CID and a C-D of by-reference.

I agree with this, for the most part.

IMO the key is that when a body part is referenced from a header, the 
*reference* defines one sort of processing for the body part. Generally 
speaking you don't want any *other* processing to happen to it based 
simply on its presence. The by-reference C-D is, IMO, really just a 
context that has no *implicit* processing based on its presence.

*In principle* there could be a body part that is referenced more than 
once, in which case it would be processed once for each reference. 
Similarly, there could be a body part that is present and intended to be 
processed based on its context, and there is *also* a reference to it 
that should be processed based on the reference. This is not a likely 
case by any means, but I think it is cleaner to separate the two 
mechanisms. Using the same body for both then just falls out. An 
(unlikely and generally nonsensical) example might be a PUBLISH request 
containing a presence body, that also has a Geoloc header referring to 
the same body part.

To summarize my point: the C-D of a body part provides a way to identify 
a context that in turn defines some processing to be performed on that 
part. A cid-reference to a body part *also* provides a way to define 
some processing to be performed on a part. Either, both, or neither may 
apply to any given body part. (The *neither* is important, because there 
may be a reference in an optional header that isn't processed by the 
recipient.)

> 4) Furthermore, any future extension which is not for the user-context MUST NOT use any C-T currently defined in any RFC or WG draft for SIP, including already defined event-packages.  That sounds harsh, but that's what we need to do to get a very high degree of backwards-compatibility I think. 

I agree it sounds harsh. IMO it is *too* harsh. That may mean I can't 
include an application/sdp in a MESSAGE, or in an info-package, even if 
it carefully *doesn't* use C-D of "session".

I think we should assume that complying UAs *should* be using C-D 
already to disambiguate, and they are simply broken if they don't.

> So this means you can't do a geoloc-type thing using "text/plain", for example, or really even "application/pidf+xml", which is what geoloc currently uses in its draft. 

This is a poster child for the problem. AFAIK "application/pidf+xml" is 
appropriate for its use, and forcing it to define a new C-T for the same 
thing in order to get around this would be a pain. At least in this case 
the possibility of conflict with non-conforming implementations isn't 
great because Geoloc isn't likely to be needed in PUBLISH or NOTIFY 
where conflicts might be possible.

But Geoloc should use "by-reference" when it doesn't want the body 
processed other than as a result of the header reference.

> And body-handling or some other draft should list all such C-T's, so future extensions can know the list to avoid.  And if we want to just say no C-T currently define by IANA period, I'm fine with that too.  Note this does NOT prevent future SIP RFCs from using a C-T defined by such an extension as geoloc.  For example, if geoloc uses "application/foobar", then a future Event-package could use that too; because that future event package would normatively reference body-handling.

I agree we should further discuss the backward compatibility issues. But 
I think we need not / should not be quite so resrictive.

> 5) IF we need an option tag (and I do NOT think we do), then we should create one and only one tag right now, for the body-handling draft's logic.  Future extensions which are not for the user-context would then NOT need more option tags simply due to body-handling issues, but can use that generic one.  I would also put in some extreme language into the body-handling option tag about what it means to put such a thing in a Require header, to dissuade people from doing that.
> 
> 6) If there are some already defined things which do not follow the above rules, we either (a) grandfather them into body-handling right now, or if they're not really in use, then either (b) deprecate or (c) replace them. (and I would vote for (b), fwiw)

I agree with this.

You could start with a threat model and a set of constraints.

I'll turn that question around: what do you think this really achieves
for the ordinary non-technical phone user?

      * Sometimes the phone has an indicator that the caller-id has been
        verified.

      * Sometimes the phone fails to have that indicator, but
        regardless, the caller-id may be correct.

I believe that the false-negatives in the latter greatly diminish the
value of the former, because you still have to answer the phone to find
out if it is who it claims to be.

Further - what part of a caller-id does a phone display?  Given:

	From: "Scott Lawrence" <scott@some-attacker-domain.com>

what do you suppose a phone will display?  For most phones I use today,
it will either be "Scott Lawrence" or "scott", and in any event most
won't have enough characters for a long address.  These display
limitations and ambiguities mean that an attacker can trivially create a
return-routable address that will very likely be displayed in the same
way as some other address, so even the positive case can be spoofed as

Hi Christer,

Replying to email concerning version 2 since these comments are also
applicable to version draft-ietf-sip-199-03.

Concerning option 1, it only works if 18x actually reaches the UAC.  If
it doesn't, the 199's would continue to be retried and ignored.

Because of the retry issue, I prefer option 2.  However I don't have
strong preference concerning the strength: MAY, SHOULD, or MUST.

The use of lower case RFC 2119 words also add confusion since ambiguous
to reader if intentional or error.  I prefer "SHOULD" or "MAY" to allow
the client to decide appropriateness of what should be locally signaled
to caller (silence, ringing, etcetera) until subsequent response
received.

I agree.  However if the proxy assumes such a device will answer
quickly, the strength of MUST prevents a proxy from optimizing to avoid
a mostly useless 199.

Either alternative is OK with me.

To me, it sounds like an update to RFC 3261; however I'm ok with saying
it isn't. :)

As mentioned, the reason would be to allow offer/answer compliance.  The
specific example is INVITE without offer sent; 18x non-reliable sent; if
199 sent reliable, it is required to contain an offer.

> [JRE] The word "may" is important here. Until we find an approach that is viable (and I don't think we are quite there yet with DERIVE), it is difficult to tell whether a better-than-nothing approach would be worthwhile.

I think DERIVE is a viable approach for spoofing protection and I 
haven't found
a convincing argument that would counter that really. (abstracting now from
the dialog package).  In fact, DERIVE is MORE viable than anything else 
which
has been discussed. RFC4474 has turned out not to be viable, and neither did
From, P-Asserted-Identity or other possible "just-nothing" approach. To 
provide
arguments: we know that RFC4474 has not been deployed. We thus do not have
running code and cannot rely on it. sipit reports show two implementations,
one of them is ours in SER, which to my best knowledge has not found
a deployment. I guess that's because reliance on CAs and excessive message
integrity. (who in the world does NOT rewrite SDP???) Security of 
plain-text
From/PAI hopefuly requires no discussion.

I understand you have been worried about B2BUA. That's a legitimate concern,
but let's face it...fixing applications is fixing consequences and not the
problem. Today it is DERIVE, yesterday it was REFER and tommorrow it is 
going
to be FOOBAR -- fixing the apps doesn't help. Fixing the root of the problem
is fixing the B2BUA, such as by making them more deterministic. Hadriel's
draft about sesssion id is IMO a real specific step torwards that.

Well -- we may have a way for doing reverse-routability checks which is 
simpler.
DERIVE a la SPF would avoid all of this SIP pain, however at the loss of 
per-dialog
granularity. The "resolution" would then degrade to administrative 
domain-name
ownership as opposed to "dialog ownership". In fact, we have recently 
deployed
SPF for our domain and instantly observed a dramatic increase in number 
of faked
emails that have been dropped.

To me that would be a reasonable answer to dealing with all of the SIP 
complexity
(and B2BUA, and SBC, and what-have-you). One could even guess that the share
of positive cases would be initially higher -- it takes only reliance on
configuration of sender's DNS (as opposed to updating B2BUA).

How would DERIVE change the behavior of the user in the positive case?  
How would DERIVE change the behavior of the user in the negative case?

Voice enabled chat rooms (such as iChat, Jabber, etc.), social networks, blogs, media web sites and web based customer support are emerging communications where DERIVE will just work fine. Note the potential that DERIVE can be basically protocol independent, though I hope it will first be used by SIP.

Judging DERIVE only from the perspective of 'legacy' VoIP telephony is just not right and makes me wonder about the direction of this discussion.

My two cents,

Henry

We agree that a negative-DERIVE test means nothing. Therefore, DERIVE  
provides no spoofing protection.

What it does do is potentially provide some assurance of non-spoofing.  
That's a very different thing.

In short, the default condition for an astute user should be "The  
caller ID may or may not be valid". With negative-DERIVE, this doesn't  
change.

With positive-DERIVE, the user should think "This caller-ID works for  
a return routability check. It is more likely to be valid than if I  
didn't have this test, but it might still be faked by a clever badguy".


Otherwise said: Unknown, Claims-to-be, and Can-be-reached-now-at are  
the three possible states produced by DERIVE.

Now, how astute do you think your hypothetical grandmother is likely  
to be?

At the best, we can get three states to such a user: no ID, not  
trusted, and trusted to relatively high level. Those aren't the same  
three states that come out of DERIVE. So is it useful to your  
grandmother, or just confusing?

The draft does not debate policies, it debates reverse-verification and 
that's
really the way the IETF protocols have been built. What you are 
suggesting is
a good example but I believe the policies are likely to be more complex. 
I think
of scoring, like with Email, that tries to create a balance among all of the
pieces of information that's known about a call. DERIVE is one such. The 
positive
DERIVE test increases the score to somewhere close to 100%, the negative 
test does
not make it any worse.

I don't think you have to. Most modern telephones give you a choice of how
you deal with different sorts of calls. I frequently turn on "allow trusted
numbers only" and the rest goes to voicemail. In the default mode for less
busy situations, I choose only strange (anonymous and blacklisted) calls
to go there.

The point is really we cannot devise the policies for the users, but we 
owe them
tools upon which they will be able to build up their policies. "trusted 
numbers
only" is a useful mode, but not entirely if it is too easy to take 
someone else's
 From URI.

Even then DERIVE is going to be very useful.

Let's consider terminal adapters for a while as these devices really cannot
display much information. (for native SIP phones I would recommend 
purchasing
ones with large displays and proper information displayed on it).

If annoying "scott@some-attacker-domain.com" calls a DERIVE callee, and 
DERIVE
test is succesful, the DERIVE callee can safely put the caller on a 
blacklist.
(e.g., by pressing ###) When next call from the same caller comes, it goes
directly to voicemail.

The real point is: DERIVE increases trust but does not define policies.

Yes.

I think the closest match in the history is SPF with largely the same
properties. It can't guarantee incoming traffic is evil (someone just
doesn't advertise SPF for his domain, or uses "mobile MTAs"), it can't
guarantee anything if there are clever badguys (who do DNS attacks too),
and still it effectively helps to reduce traffic with spoofed From.
In fact, after we have deployed SPF for our domain, we have seen a dramatic
increase of spoofed-From-emails with our domain name, that were declined.

I think this is a user-interface/policy thing. On my cell phone I typically
have two profiles, in one of them the phone rings for whitelisted callers,
in the other for all but blacklisted/anonymous callers.

Right but I think those C-Ds only have meaning in a user-context: one for INVITE, UPDATE, ACK, and PRACK.  No?  I wasn't implying that a C-D or body-part could not apply to the user-context of multiple methods.  Just that the "target" of the body was the user-context.

Right, but if we don't allow INFO to carry app-level responses in the INFO's response, then it's actually ok because it's really the user-context layer making that decision, and user-context is already method-specific.  In other words, if you think of it as that class object hierarchy way, the base message class doesn't need to know/care whether INFO responses can or cannot have user-context bodies - it always assumes yes.  Only the derived class for an INFO needs to know.

(and BTW I'm not sure there is general consensus yet on whether an INFO response can contain a body or not - PUBLISH can, for example)

True, good point.  We can just grandfather that as an exception to the rule and say "multipart/mixed" needs to be checked for C-Ds internally to figure out which parts belong to what, it its C-D is "render".

Hi,

I think so, yes. At least I can't remember having seen different values
being used in INVITEs and INFOs.

>>So, if we want to define an info package for ISUP transport I guess we

>That's not strictly true. When the new package was defined it could

sending the same body in an INVITE.

I don't think the info package specifcation should "update" the RFC it
refers to for the body part.

>But frankly there is no benefit to defining a package for this use,
over just continuing with the legacy usage. That's because the usage
also includes sending the same bodies in INVITE, etc. So the

I agree.

I'll take your word for that.

I'm still troubled by what I perceive as an inversion of the names: I
think of a 'session' as something that happens within a 'call'.  I
believe that you're looking for something that's a parent of 'call-id's,
not a child.  Might I suggest 'Call-Set-Id'?

I am ok with option 2.

I will use upper case, and I suggest "SHOULD".

I am still not sure I understand. Even if the device answers quickly,
the proxy can still send 199 if it receives an error response. Also,
keep in mind that the proxy will not generate a 199 unless the device
has actually created an early dialog.

I checked 3261, and if I remember correctly C/R-R are not mandatory, so
I would propose option 2.

Well, if we want to be really picky, we could say that it DOES create a
dialog, but it is immediately terminated :)

The specific example is INVITE without offer sent; 18x non-reliable
sent; if

I guess we could say that it must contain SDP in that case.

Thanks for your comments!

Yeah, header names are funny things.  We want them to mean X, but other people interpret them to mean Y, and in reality they end up meaning Z. :)

I used the term "Session-ID" because it was what I thought common operators of SIP deployments would expect it to be, because I think most people think of a Session as actually a superset of a Call-ID - the Call-ID could change 15 times along the path, but it's the same session. (in many ways a Call-ID is not a "Call" identifier at all!)  But I grant that it confuses us with media "sessions".

How about: "Correlation-ID", or even "Opaque-Call-ID"?

It's treacherous -- the original IETF definition was for "session",
which meant a particular stream of media bytes.  SIP is "Session
Initiation Protocol", a wrapper around sessions.  But with the use of
re-INVITE, one can change the enclosed session in a myriad of ways.

If we're talking about a "sequence" of SIP dialogs which are connected
end-to-end by B2BUAs, then they all enclose the *same* session.  (Which
suggests the common identifier should be put into the SDP!)  But if we
use the identifier to group dialogs in any other way -- and there have
been suggestions to do so -- then we can't call the group of dialogs a
"session" without creating confusion.

I'm confused by that comment.  Are we talking about the same DERIVE draft?
Doesn't it depend on SIP dialog identifiers to check anything?

If you're abstracting DERIVE as a higher level concept than SIP, as a "check this guy is who he claims to be", then this isn't some new concept.  It's been done for years.  For example in online form filling out, when the web server sends an email to the claimed address, with a URL link in the email (with an embedded cookie) that once clicked tells the server that the form is being filled out by someone at that address.  Or what some humans do when their credit card company calls them, and they say "I'll call you back at the number on the card".  Or what SPF or uRPF do, in a passive way.

That's a policy thing. Perhaps (as an example) increase a call atempt score
beyond a threshold that will prevent the call from falling in voicemail.

not at all.

I agree.  However the section 6.1 paragraph 2 text indicates that the
proxy MUST send 199.  I'd prefer that it is downgraded to a SHOULD to
allow the 199 to be avoided when proxy redirecting to something expected
to answer quickly.

For instance consider, call-forward-no-answer to voice mail.  After
early dialog established and no-answer timer expires, the proxy sends
CANCEL and forks the INVITE to voice-mail server expected to answer
quickly.  The current text indicates that proxy MUST send 199 if 487
received before the INVITE 200.

I just noticed that you indicated "received from the UAC".  Did you mean
"received from the UAS"?  If not, would the proxy insert it's own
Contact?

Aaah, now I understand. The voice mail will send 200 quickly, so the
early dialog between the UAC and the UAS will be terminated anyway,
without a need to send 199.

I guess we could say that the proxy can be configured not to send 199,
if a 200 is expected quickly, or something like that.

I meant received from the UAS :)

Hi John,

I think it is really worth to separate the application problem from B2BUA
problems.

I think the DERIVE "B2BUA traversal" is primarily a B2BUA problem. A 
test for
what's the root is for me "is this guaranteed to work with an RFC3261 proxy
server as used in the field"? For DERIVE, the answer is yes. It is the
B2BUA unpredictability which makes UAs enter thin ice. That can be improved
using suggestions like Hadriel has extended.

The Identity problem is possibly on both sides. It is certainly Identity 
problem,
since any field proxy will rewrite SDP for sake of NAT traversal and 
Identity will
fail. (even if there was a CA in the field). If that was fixed, some extra
effort on the B2BUA would be probably needed as well.

I think we shall make progress on those sides. Certainly on DERIVE and I 
belive
on B2BUA too. At least to the extent we understand their shortcoming, 
and the way
one can address them.

If you're abstracting DERIVE as a higher level concept than SIP, as a "check this guy is who he claims to be", then this isn't some new concept.  It's been done for years.  For example in online form filling out, when the web server sends an email to the claimed address, with a URL link in the email (with an embedded cookie) that once clicked tells the server that the form is being filled out by someone at that address.  Or what some humans do when their credit card company calls them, and they say "I'll call you back at the number on the card".  Or what SPF or uRPF do, in a passive way.

I think it belongs in this class, but I don't think we have a practicable
solution -- one is too strong, the other one too weak. (whoever doesn't
wish to indulge in a lengthy debate is invited to share his SIP address
with me -- I'll be happy to demonstrate that)

RFC4474 is simply not there. Despite we=iptel/TKLC have implemented in SER,
we found  ourselves to be rather alone with it. I think the root reason
is it is heavier than it seems. Body integrity protection and dependence 
on CAs
makes it just too impracticable. I would say as a hand waving 
guesstimate 90% of
all SDPs on this  planet gets rewritten for sake of NAT traversal and 
there is 0%
SIP deployments  leaning on a CA.

RFC3325, to the same extent as RFC3261 (From header field), buy really too
little. It is to some extent workable within single-domain, but not even 
that
really reliably. (UAs would have to trust an IP address, but we run into the
questions like "which", or UAs would have to use TLS which appears largely
unused as well).

I think that's about it indeed.
I think what we are seeking is something between zero-security and 
heavy-weight
security. None of these two is really practicable. Like in the web -- we 
have
no plain-text HTTP for online shoping, but the shopper don't really 
prove their
identity protocol-wise either (other than sharing credit card number 
over TLS).
Identity is a hard thing to solve, and it is really not easy to get to one's
DNA. (probably it is good so) Therefore what you called "functional proof"
appears more attractive to me.

Right -- the consolation comes in that she can trace the caller if she
accepted a DERIVE-tested call and found it uncomfortable.

Yes. Thank you indeed for catching this nuances. I think that addresses
some of the concerns on the mailing list, which were result on somehow
inadequately high expectations on DERIVE. This is what it can and can't
do.

So it is. I think success of DERIVE-like tests depends largely on gaining
the critical mass. For that, the key prerequisite is it must be very simple.

honestly, I don't know how its adoption will develop. I would historically
compare it to SPF, which required minimum changes and achieved its function
and current level of deployment by simplicity. a 2007 study shows 5%
penetration for it.
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/01/11/dns-extensions.html
Introduction of SPF for our own domain has quite increased the rejection
rate.

One of the ideas would be actually to give up the reverse check on SIP level
in exchange for DNS. That would similarly show that the caller (at domain
level) is in control of its name. Less granular, still better-than-nothing.

Well, I don't think really this is specific to DERIVE -- most of 
communication technologies
are useful only if used frequently. (economists call it networking I 
recall). The starting
point is obviously zero, the key challenge is a growth strategy and I 
thinkt the key to it
is simplicity.

DERIVE can't do social engineering. DERIVE only verifies routeability. 
DERIVE helps
her to trust sarkozy@sarkozy.fr if she knows it is a legitimate address. 
If she accepts
sarkozy@radioyerevan.ca with a positive DERIVE test, and dislikes she 
knows after fact
she can put the URI on a blacklist.

I simply set my From: to the *target's* URI, then send that INVITE to every number I can.  Thus I get other devices to flood the target with SUBSCRIBEs.  It's not as annoying as ringing the target's phone, for sure, but it's still an attack.  And unlike SMURF or hammer attack, it only requires me to know the target's AoR, not its IP or MAC.  And unlike a direct INVITE attack, I don't even need authorization or a path to reach the intended target; I only need to be able to reach a lot of Derive-capable UA's and hope some of them can reach the intended target.

This is a question IMO: what does the attacker gain here? IMO a free 
topology hiding feature,
he is not getting an amplification. Couldn't we lower the concerns by 
fingerpointing at the
attacker in the DERIVE tests?

Well, the Security area wonks are going to want us to have a threat  
assessment. What is the risk? In what scenarios does it occur? What  
are the consequences?

Given the threat assessment, we then need to understand how the  
solution impacts that threat. What are the possible ranges of policy?  
What is the recommended policy? How does it impact behavior in a  
system that uses this solution?

My Linksys ua-du-jour is usually hooked to a black phone with no  =

Actually, for each INVITE, the attacker is potentially getting  
amplification in that SUBSCRIBE will be retransmitted until timeout or  
a response. So if the From: field isn't even pointed at SIP UA, one  
can get some level of amplification in just doing a DOS-flood on it.  
Say, 7 or 8 to 1. Also, since the INVITE can be very small, we might  
be looking at a 20 to 1 amplifier in terms of total data volume.  
Pointing that at a mobile device could be very annoying.

I'm only halfway through -03 and I'll be sending more later, but this  
winged one of the comments I was going to make.

I think this MUST that Brett was pointing to needs to be a MAY, not a  
MUST or a SHOULD.

This is an optimization. Nothing breaks if the proxy decides to not  
forward a 199 - you just don't
get the optimization.

Instead of going down the route of specifying how proxies can be  
configured to behave, I suggest
the document simply say choosing how quickly to return a 199 is a  
matter of implementation policy and
leave a note to implementers that in the absence of other reason, "as  
soon as possible" will increase the
effectiveness of the optimization.

Hi John,

My apologies for so late answers -- I have been too offline recently.
Anyhow -- while this is a certainly a legitimate concerns, I don't
think it is a prohibite one -- I think it is a migration one. That means
the value is initially low and grows with size of the "derive network".

I think too that's very important. IMO, for this type of BTN security
size of the "network" is really important, and for that simplicity is
the key. For such results I'm playing a bit with the SPF idea -- would
not that be perhaps something that would gain us good adoption? It gains
as less than dialog verification, but it is still getting us BTN at
per-domain level.

I've been saying for a long time that I think what will help is people  
getting in the same room for a significant chunk of time and  
discussing what the problem is - particular the threat and trust model  
associated with the two types of names we use in SIP.

Hi Jiri,
I can definitely see the pro's/con's of it, and think it's interesting as a BTNS trick; though probably not for my particular customer types per se.

But I actually have a very different question about the draft:
Why did you submit it to the IETF SIP WG?

By that I mean it should interoperate without any protocol changes AFAICT, and anyone can do it right now.  So if you just want to document it publicly as an option anyone can do anytime, why not just submit an Informational doc to SIPPING, or even just as an individual informational draft? (and avoid the hassle ;)

If you want it to work across all domains with their unique policies and such, and get people to comment on all the nuances they are worried about, well then that's a horse of a different color.  But I'm really just curious what you're trying to achieve, so I can know what types of comments you're looking for.

-hadriel
p.s. sorry if you answered that already - I may have missed it.

Now you are getting really confused on layers. These are the circumstances where the correct error is 4xx - 6xx indicating that the SIP level was unable to deliver to the application.

Ummm... no, that was the point *I* was making. :)

Someone *else* in the email said:

And I said that's not always possible - the app layer may have no idea about a malformed body content arriving.  We need to allow 4xx-6xx to be body *content* formatting errors too.  I.e., if you send me an INFO for a package "myXml" with body-part of C-T "application/xml" and that body-part's content is in fact just the string ":-P", I should be able to respond with a 4xx.  The question is what the xx should be.

Sure, but I meant it in the context of even once everyone does it.  Let's assume every UA on the planet supports doing this DERIVE check right now.  If the check only works a small portion of the time when the call is actually good, then I would argue it won't stop Palin from assuming she's talking to Sarkozy - because a failure is not really a failure and can't be treated as a failure.  It's kinda like that annoying "This page contains both secure and nonsecure items" warning you get when you go to www.ietf.org agenda pages.  You get it so often you just ignore it, or turn it off altogether.

Anyway, Derive can't actually detect forgeries - it can only detect (some) non-forgeries.  That's a different property than a 4474-type thing; in a 4474-type thing a verification failure is actually a real failure; the kind of thing to alarm on and log and such. (if we had a working 4474-type thing)

And I didn't mean it as a knock on Derive - I meant that it contradicted Dean's claims, but if and only if Derive fails most of the time when the call is in fact legit.

I believe the cases where Derive fails even when a call is legit (false negatives), are:
1) Multiple contacts for a single AoR - it's a roll of the dice to get the right one
2) No contact for an AoR (e.g., From-URI is the main business number)
3) Can't reach that AoR domain (e.g., the call was forwarded to you, with no applicable SIP direct return path)
4) Can't reach that AoR domain with a SUBSCRIBE, but could an INVITE
5) B2BUA's in the signaling path, but the return path does not cross the same exact B2BUA's
6) B2BUA's in the signaling path, and they don't all support dialog-event package
7) UAC itself doesn't support the dialog-event package
8) UAC's domain doesn't allow subscriptions to dialog-event from outside its domain
9) E.164 Phone numbers, in general
10) Malicious middleboxes

(Some of those above are eventually fixable, BTW)

I believe the cases where Derive passes (says "legit") even though the call is actually a forgery (false positives), are:
1) Malicious middleboxes
2) Baiting attacks
3) From-URI encoding hacks
4) DNS spoofing or other attacks on rfc3263

(Which isn't much worse than any other mechanism, fwiw)

Such an Sdp attribute will correlate the media streams. It could be problematic if a B2BUA generates a request without Sdp (medialess INVITE etc). 

Looking at it from draft's troubleshooting use case perspective, if one wants to track the signaling flow end-to-end, I like e2e-session-group-id.

Not only that, but Session-ID's got nothing to do with media, period.  It's something for any message types, for example a SUBSCRIBE, or MESSAGE, or whatever.  It's more like e2e-call-id.

I don't think 4474 has failed to get implementation due to CA's.  At least companies don't seem to have trouble getting them for HTTPS. (They're not *that* hard to get AFAIK, though they're not free)  I think 4474 failed to get implementation because (1) most people don't have this problem yet, (2) many don't think they'll have a problem anytime soon, and (3) it won't work in the cases it would actually provide value for. (or at least #3 is why we didn't bother with it)

The main "issue" with 4474 is in fact signing that SDP.  The other issues with it that make it break are all resolvable, I think.

If you're willing to live with ignoring SDP, as DERIVE does, then a concept similar to 4474 can easily be made to work.  But so far we have not gotten consensus in this WG that we can be allowed to ignore the SDP.  (even though we have made the argument that we're not providing media identity - we're providing caller-identity)  :(

I assume you mean GENERATE a 199, right? That is what Brett is talking
about.

Because, if the proxy receives a 199, it would of course forward it
according to normal proxy rules.

I can remove the MUST, but I think we should have a SHOULD. If the proxy
supports the extension (and the UAC has indicated support of it), the
proxy should use it (except in scenarios like the one Brett described).

I will think about some wording.

Thanks for your comments!

Christer

Hi,

Let's assume that it will take some time to process the body content -
and may then figure out that something is wrong with it.

But, on SIP level everything went fine, so you should send 200 (OK) for
the INFO, and not wait for the application to process the body content
first.

Then, if the application finds out that something is wrong (on an
application level) with the body content, it should send a separate INFO
to indicate that.

But, if the body content e.g. contains non-allowed characters, and can't
be parsed, the SIP stack can of course reject the INFO.

Regards,

Christer

Alternatively you could say that 200 OK meant that the application had 
accepted, but not necessarily processed it.  As part of accepting a message, 
the application could sanity check it.  That would allow things like 
malformed messages and other such lower layer machinery to be handled in a 
common way.  Otherwise you presumably have to define how malformed messages, 
and a whole bunch of other error conditions, are handled for every single 
INFO package.  It also allows the application the option to process the 
message then and there, which will likely simplify a lot of INFO exchanges, 
especially if INFO is allowed a response body.

Regards,

Pete.

Hi,

I guess we are going into implementation details, but I think that if
the message SIP syntax wise is correct, the package has been negotiated
etc, the SIP stack should be able to handle it over to the application
and send 200 (OK). It should not need to wait for any information back
from the application before sending the response.

>As part of accepting a message, the application could sanity

Correct.

>Otherwise you presumably have to define how malformed messages, and a
whole bunch of other error 
>conditions, are handled for every single INFO package.  It also allows
the application the option to process the message 
>then and there, which will likely simplify a lot of INFO exchanges,
especially if INFO is allowed a response body.

Malformated INFOs should be hanlde like any other malformed SIP method.

Christer

But only the application (and not the SIP layer) knows whether it is 
malformed or not.  So the SIP layer needs to ask the application whether it 
will accept the message before giving a response.

I'm still having trouble on the fringes defining user-context.
In this case its something like dialog-usage context. That would work 
for events too, since each has its own dialog-usage. It would also, I 
think, work for *legacy* INFO.

But it doesn't work for info-packages. All the info packages are within 
a single invite-dialog-usage. Yet each has its own context.

So getting all the terminology to work right is tricky. But I think I 
agree with the gist of what you are saying.

In other words, if you think of it as that class object hierarchy way, the base message class doesn't need to know/care whether INFO responses can or cannot have user-context bodies - it always assumes yes.  Only the derived class for an INFO needs to know.

OK.

OK. I think we agree. Again it may be a little tricky to scope the 
exception properly.

Well, maybe not if the document stood alone. But doesn't that doc define 
the *use* in sip as well as the mime-type and C-D? I would think that 
document would have to be revised anyway to introduce the use of info 
packages for that purpose. So changing the C-D to be used when sending 
an info-package would not be an unreasonable thing to do.

Nevertheless, I think I am ok with info packages defining the C-Ds their 
parts use.

I think the distinction drawn here can be signaled using 200 or 202.
If the body has been parsed and is known to be valid return 200, whether 
it has been acted upon or not. If it has not been verified to have valid 
syntax, return 202.

(As WG chair)

I indicated earlier that the proposed interim meeting in Malta would not occur.

I did leave open the possibility that we might organise one somewhere else, possibly in conjunction with SIPPING. 

I can now indicate that that is not going to happen, i.e. the chairs have abandoned an attempt to organise such a meeting.

What I will be doing is focussing on some of the issues that seem to need something other than email discussion and organising some conference calls. These conference calls will be more of a status of a large design team, rather than an open SIP WG meeting. I will post to the SIP list details of what groups we are getting together, and will accommodate reasonable requests to participate (i.e. that you believe you have something to offer to progress the work)

The first set of calls will probably be on identity issues and how to prepare for the next full meeting. I will be including the authors of the various current drafts, but if you consider you should be involved and are not in that list (or accidentally get missed off that list, then please send me a mail.

If you have other subject areas where you believe that we would benefit from some interim discussion that is not solely by email, then please raise it.

regards

Keith

That's not necessarily true.  I could have a firewall-type checker in the SIP layer that verifies XML syntax is valid, which knows nothing about the semantics of the elements/attributes themselves, before passing it on to an app layer.

And before anyone says "but we can't require it to do so and we have to accommodate a layered model only understanding the content in the app-layer" - that's NOT the issue.  Of course we have to allow for only the app-layer understanding content - we should even *assume* it.

But the reality is that we already allow a 4xx response to be sent for a bunch of sip-layer error reasons.  Because of that, the app-layer *sender* of an INFO request has to accommodate "delivery-failure" based on a 4xx response already.  Period.  Therefore, an _integrated_ model *receiver* would simply send one of those 4xx responses if it failed content formatting error checks when it receives an INFO request, because from a functional app-layer perspective to the INFO *sender* it is no different than a delivery-failure.  There is nothing we can do to stop that behavior, because there's nothing broken with that behavior, either in terms of interop or semantics.  We can try to say "even if the content is malformed you MUST send back 200 and then a new INFO with an error code", but that will be summarily ignored.

So the question is simply if we want a specific response code for content formatting errors, such as 488, to help troubleshooting - or if they should just send 400 or 415 as they do today.  Again, this doesn't prevent a fully layered model from sending 200 back and then some INFO request upstream with an error code - it just makes it easier to troubleshoot what an integrated model can already do by sending back a 400 or 415.

It had damn well better do that only for an application/xml body type.  
If it sees something that sort of looks like XML and then tries to  
check it (and it isn't really XML), we're back to coupling  
applications to the SIP protocol (or worse yet, to the SBC . ..)

I would say it as something like "If the UAS cannot decode the MIME  
structure of the body because of formatting errors, it returns a 606.  
If the UAS can decode the MIME structure of the body but does not know  
what to do with the body parts, either because they are of an  
unrecognized type or because there is no application to consume those  
body parts, the UAS returns a 415. Otherwise, the UAS delivers the  
body part to the application and returns a 200 OK."

I would leave discussion of application-level rejection of body parts  
entirely out of the discussion.

This seems to make it *incorrect* to return any error response in the 
case where the content of the body is incorrect. (For instance if the 
syntax of the body part is inconsistent with the Content-Type declared 
for that part.

While I am ok with *allowing* the UAS to return a 200 in this case, I 
think we go too far to say they UAS MUST NOT return an error for this 
situation.

OTOH, none of the above is normative language, so perhaps the whole 
thing is to be construed as a recommendation or note? I find it very 
difficult after the fact to interpret such language. I would rather that 
it be very explicit about what is normative and what is not intended to be.

	Thanks,
	Paul

No I read "...either because they are of an unrecognized type..." to be inclusive of body content format.  It does not say "...of an unrecognized *Content-Type*".  I get to choose what "type" means for me.

If the syntax is correct enough for the MIME layer t decode the  
object, SIP is happy.

For example, let;s say it is an image/jpeg of your girlfriend. If the  
SIP Stack can unpack the image/jpeg from the MIME, SIP is happy. If it  
turns out to be a bad picture of your girlfriend and makes her look  
like the clown from "It", that's not SIP's problem. If it's actually  
an image/gif with an erroneous image/jpeg tag on it, that's also not  
SIP's problem.

I'm thinking this should be normative, actually. If it's an error that  
SIP can't detect, reporting it as a SIP error seems bogus. If we have  
to have application-driven errors, we probably need a new response code.

Devices already do report mime body *content* errors in SIP responses. That's what a 488/606 really is, for example, for SDP.  And some devices already respond with 415 due to malformed body content of other types.

There's actually nothing wrong with that, from a semantics perspective - they're telling you your request failed to be delivered due to a body error, and it's true.  And there's no interop issue either.  Your code already has to be able to handle a failure response for that delivery attempt, and handle it as a delivery failure, and tell your app-layer about that delivery-failure.

The only questions, really, are:
1) Do we need to define in the base INFO doc how to handle app-layer failures using separate upstream INFO requests.  For example, do we need to define how malformed document errors are reported in upstream INFO messages.  I don't think we do, because I think it's only a subset of packages that would ever care, and they'd probably need their own semantics and syntax for what they care about and what it means to them.  So there's no need to pollute the base doc with that.

2) Can we allow app-specific failures in INFO responses, for example do we allow packages to define specific response codes and bodies which can be used in responses; or do we only allow bodies and package-specific responses in INFO requests. (or option C is laissez-faire, and debate it in package definitions - as PUBLISH does essentially)

Define "malformed document error". Do you mean garbled MIME, or a body  
that extracts for MIME but isn't valid for its content-type? Or do you  
mean a body that is valid for it's content-type, but subject to higher- 
level evaluation that it fails (for example, it's valid-looking XML,  
but it fails the schema verification).

I think it would be deeply stupid to have a package definition define  
a new SIP response code. Just because we messed up and got our  
transport confused with our application in the past doesn't mean we  
should keep repeating that mistake mindlessly.

Yes, all of the above.  It fails formatting syntax rules, not semantics. (And schema validation I think of as formatting rules)  If it's gzip and it doesn't decompress, for example.

I don't think we need to define a specific upstream INFO request mechanism to indicate such a failure.  If a package cares about such things, it can define one, since it will probably need other real app-layer error indications anyway.  For example KPML went to the trouble of doing that.  Most wouldn't care, I think.

I'm worried that people are going to take this as evidence that the  
SIP Stack SHOULD go to great lengths to validate content. For example,  
are we going to require every SIP UA have HTTP so that it can retrieve  
XML schemae, and an XML validtory to check body parts with, and then  
validate every XML body part before handing it ti the application?  
What response code should SIP send if a body part un-MIMEs ok, but the  
SIP UA can't find the schema needed to validate the body? What if some  
application data used invalid XML in his body?

I'd really rather not have this as protocol considerations for SIP.  
The SIP stack has to be able to pull the content out of its (possibly  
multipart) MIME wrapper. If the MIME wrapping is good and there's an  
application to hand the payload off to, I think SIP should be happy to  
send a 200 OK.

Of course it should.  I think you're missing the point (or I'm missing yours) - there's no debate that we have to allow a SIP request with valid SIP-layer stuff and valid mime wrapper and all be responded to with a 200 ok.  Or at least I'm not debating that.  It would be silly to mandate a SIP stack to do any more than that.  But I also think we really shouldn't explicitly disallow me to send you back a 4xx.  It's a non-sequitur.  I can send a 4xx anyway, and as long as the resultant behavior is the same, who's the wiser?  I have really not delivered it to an app-layer; there is no recovering from this condition (it's not like you can programmatically re-format it and hope this time I understand it); and whatever action you take due to a delivery-failure is really the right action to take in this case too.

I think your point is that we shouldn't explicitly point this out, for fear of people thinking they need to do it?  So that rules out creating a new specific response code for it, and just letting 415 or 400 cover that case.  (that's essentially what all the other SIP specs do too - don't mention it, leave it implementation specific)  I don't see people having interop issues with it so that's fine, though it makes troubleshooting a bit more laborious.

I think we should just be honest and admit that we're doing no one any 
favors by being very dogmatic about layering here. At the end of the day 
SIP is not a transport protocol. Who says we need to be so strict about 
separating SIP from app.

So Hadriel, I guess I agree with your conclusion but I agree with Dean 
that it really is a layer violation. I just don't see it as such a big deal.

Hi,
=20
No, user=3Dphone should not be added. Only the To tag for the dialog,
which you get in responses, should be added to the ACK (and all other
in-dialog requests).

Christer

	Hi,

	=20

	Is it correct to have "user=3Dphone" added only in ACK's To header
while it is missing in initial INVITE, even though both the messages use
Tel-URI.

I agree with Handriel and Anders.

The distinction that Dean is trying to draw is a very fuzzy one when you 
dig into it. Remember that a multipart is also just a body type, and 
taking it apart is body processing. We could argue that the specific 
degree of multipart parsing that is required to identify the individual 
elements is required in order to respond to the sip message, but parsing 
of other parts, even other multipart parts is not, and so failures there 
must not be reported. But then what about a stack that decomposes the 
entire tree of multiparts first and then deals out the parsed parts to 
the "invite" application and the other applications? What if there is a 
multipart/alternative with C-D of "session"? Is it ok to return a 488 if 
that can't be decomposed into its contained parts, or a 415 if the 
contained parts don't contain SDP?

I think we need to work this so there is some latitude for how the 
application layers the processing.

	Thanks,
	Paul

Subject: [Sip] Query related to Expires header with value 0 in INVITE

Hi All,

I have some queries related to expires header in SIP message.

RFC 3261 Section 20.19
" The value of this field is an integral number of seconds (in decimal)
   between 0 and (2**32)-1, measured from the receipt of the request"

Does this mean 0 is a valid value of Expires header ? I am confused because=
 of "between" word here as meaning might different if "from 0 to  (2**32)-1=
" have used.

>>> It doesn't look like properly.  See  RFC 3261 Section 13.2.1

   The UAC MAY add an Expires header field (Section 20.19) to limit the
   validity of the invitation.  If the time indicated in the Expires
   header field is reached and no final answer for the INVITE has been
   received, the UAC core SHOULD generate a CANCEL request for the
   INVITE, as per Section 9.

So, immediately after INVITE, the UAC should generate CANCEL.  But it has t=
o wait until it gets some response.

Section 9.1

   If no provisional response has been received, the CANCEL request MUST
   NOT be sent; rather, the client MUST wait for the arrival of a
   provisional response before sending the request.

Does Expires value in INVITE is modified by intermittent SIP entities befor=
e it reaches to its destination?

Proxies do not modify headers present in the request it receives.  See sect=
ion 16.6.

If yes, then what should be UAS behavior when it receives INVITE with value=
 0 in Expires header ? Should UAS respond with 487 ?


Section 13.1.1 [1]
  "If the request is an INVITE that contains an Expires header
 field, the UAS core sets a timer for the number of seconds
 indicated in the header field value.  When the timer fires, the
 invitation is considered to be expired.  If the invitation
 expires before the UAS has generated a final response, a 487
 (Request Terminated) response SHOULD be generated."

So the UAS should generate a 487 right away.

Thanks in Advance
Anita

I've been told that the RFC editor will be refitting all drafts  
approved after November 10 so that they use the "new" boilerplate any  
copyright when they are published as RFCs. This potentially affects  
IPR interests in the drafts (although no more so than it does any new  
draft with the new boilerplate), so if you have a draft in the RFC Ed  
queue, this might be of interest to you.

Personally, it doesn't worry me at all.

Theoretically, the RFC Ed will be making a general announcement to  
this effect shortly.

But so far we have not gotten consensus in this WG that we can be allowed to ignore the SDP.

Possibly yes.

Definitely the SDP is the key obstacle. I mean the WG seems to be quite
insincere to itself if it bets on pristine SDP. For sake of record, we have
been deploying SDP-rewriting proxies since 2003 and till today we would not
be able to run VoIP without it. It almost reminds me when someone during
an applauded NAT rant asked a WG who is using them and about 99% raised
hands (probably applauding in anticipation of turning on IPv6 next month).


Would be RFC4474 rolling out without this limitation -- I'm guessing 
not, but
unlike the SDP fact, it is a guess of mine. We indeed obtained some 
concerns
about the extra CA overhead (more about third party, SLA, etc rather than
technical concerns) but it was more what-if type of concern and we
did not pass the SDP-if. On the scale straight-forward/doable/better-not
I would upgrade it from better-not to doable but not to straight-forward.

If the check only works a small portion of the time when the call is actually good, then I would argue it won't stop Palin from assuming she's talking to Sarkozy - because a failure is not really a failure and can't be treated as a failure.  It's kinda like that annoying "This page contains both secure and nonsecure items" warning you get when you go to www.ietf.org agenda pages.  You get it so often you just ignore it, or turn it off altogether.

That's a different property than a 4474-type thing; in a 4474-type thing a verification failure is actually a real failure; the kind of thing to alarm on and log and such. (if we had a working 4474-type thing)

Yes. (Under the assumption that sender domain is using it, otherwise you 
are ending up with "dunno" too.)

Yes, that's I think a very good summary.

So if you just want to document it publicly as an option anyone can do anytime, why not just submit an Informational doc to SIPPING, or even just as an individual informational draft? (and avoid the hassle ;)

Hi Hadriel,

The interest for me is how can we create something that will
help against From spoofing and have a close-to-zero-introduction cost
with incentives for those paying it. Generally I think reverse
checks are quite effective in that (also due to the link to DNS name, which
establishes a relationship to a paying entity ... identity is not entirely
worthless).

I'm not yet really sure which would be the "best deployable 
reverse-checking"
mechanism, and thus neither what is the best place for working on it.
If it was sip/dialog-based as right now, SIPPING/BCP would seem 
appropriate to me.
But perhaps the initial debate will hint at DNS just to avoid the
SIP complexity at the loss of per-dialog granularity. I would be less
sure where to place it then.

if you don't care about who is calling you, then this is clearly
not a problem for you (Even though one could come up with distinctive
ringing but I'm not sure those who generally don't care about who is
calling them will be interested in it.)

I actually find that with GSM, caller-id is the only massively used
telephony features.

Thanks, that's helpful, we will try to address it in -01. Hadriel's list

Jiri, I would like to make sure I understand exactly what is broken  
here. So, say some B2BUA that implements 4474, like SER is running at  
iptel.org. And I have an account, say fluffy@iptel.org. Now my phone  
is registered and sends an INVITE to SER with the From set to "fluffy@iptel.org 
". My understanding is SER edits the SDP then does the 4474 signature  
and sends it on.

So in the case you are discussing here, what exactly is broken that  
stops iptel.org from both editing SDP and doing 4474?

Yes, that's the one.


We need to distinguish exactly which likely cases DERIVE might work  
against that null-auth doesn't; this becomes part of the "threat  
model" that is needed to get past the security droids.

1) If the call goes to another SER in another domain that is fixing NAT for its UAS, then that SER will edit the SDP before sending it to the UAS (or at least if it's doing what SBC's have been doing for many years).  If that SER is the verification service then sure it can do as you say, instead of letting the UAS verify it.  But maybe they want to let the UAS make its own decisions. (crazy guys!)

But as we've talked about before, that is just the tip of the iceberg because changing SDP for NAT traversal is only one of a long list of reasons for changing SDP.  And in most cases we're not talking about only the UAS not being able to verify - we're talking the last/terminating domain as a whole being unable to verify. (which was kinda the point of it I thought)  So to continue the list of cases...

2) If the call goes to a 3PCC server that holds onto SDP when it forwards on the INVITE, then the signature breaks.

3) If the call goes to a transcoding element that modifies the SDP codec list when it forwards on the INVITE, then the signature breaks.

4) If the call goes through transit providers (long-distance/wholesale/international), then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

5) If the call goes from an Enterprise PBX over a SIP Trunk to a provider, and they route the invite to another Enterprise PBX, then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

6) If the call goes from an Enterprise PBX over a SIP Trunk to a provider, and they route the invite to a mobile-phone provider, such as a GSMA-IPX one, then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

7) If the call goes from an Enterprise PBX over a SIP Trunk to a provider, and they route the invite to another provider, then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

8) If the call goes from a provider over a SIP Trunk to an Enterprise PBX, and the PBX routes the invite to a branch office over a VPN, then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

9) If the call goes from a branch office over a VPN to an Enterprise PBX, and the PBX routes the invite over a SIP Trunk to its provider, then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

10) If the call goes from anyone anywhere, to anyone who could actually benefit from something like 4474 instead of simply using PAI, then often SDP gets changed and the signature breaks.

Minutes of SIP WG meeting at IETF 73
Edited by Dean Willis based on notes by:
Vijay Gurbani
Scott Lawrence
Paul Kyzivat
Alan Johnston

Session 1, Monday November 17, 2008, 1740-1930, Salon D

Topic: Agenda and Status
Led by Chairs
Slides presented

Agenda accepted as presented.


Issue: Interim in Jan 2009.

Proposed interim in Malta during January 2009 discussed. Note: This
interiom was cancelled later in the week.

Issue: SIP Location Conveyance

Ted Hardie and James Polk reported on status in GEOPRIV. They disagree
on how far from a consensus we are.


Issue: Dotson's Mutual Authentication draft

WG has consensus on pursuing, but ADs and Security Area adviser are
opposed to this work. Therefore, we will continue to ignore it until
further notice.




Topic: URI and Parameter Delivery
Led by Jonaathan Rosenberg
Slides presented
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-rosenberg-sip-target-uri-delivery-00.txt

Issue: Free Phone Numbers.

Agreed that there is no differentiation required here, they may be
treated as targets.

Issue: What is a "retarget" operation? This

Following discussion, Jonathan agreed to add a definition and
discussion of this to the draft.

Issue: Normative behavior update for RFC 4244

Consensus noted to revise RFC 4244, and fix some other known problems
with it at teh same time. MAry Barnes volunteered to edit the
document.

Issue: Reference to URNS.

Ted Hardie prposed removing teh reference to URNs, as incorrect and
confusing.

Issue: Discussion of P-Celled-Party-ID

Agreed that this needs furtehr work. Christer Holmberg will send text.

Issue: Parameter name conflict ("target") with RFC 4458.

Editor will change the name of the parameter.

Poll: Shall WG adopt this draft towards our charter deliverable on the
topic? Chairs reported a strong consensus to do so.




Topic: INFO Packages
Led by Eric Burger
Slides presented
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-sip-info-events-01.txt

Issue: The "send-info" set

Discussion focues on use cases, with DTMF being proposed and found
inadequate. Agreed to deprecate this from draft; each side to only
declare receive capabilities.

Issue: Info in SUBSCRIBE dialogs

Can INFO be used only in INVITE dialogs, or also in SUBSCRIBE dialogs?

Consensus on use only in INVITE dialogs. Robert Sparks is to send text
on topic to Eric.

Issue: To allow or not allow Contact header field in INFO

Agreed that we can use the existing rule for target-refresh
requests. Further text is to be solicited on-list.

Issue: Case sensitivity in INFO pakcage names

Noted that package identifiers are in the grammr as octets, therefore
case sensitive per RFC 3265.

Agreed that registry definition shall include text prohibiting
registration of names that differ only in case.

Issue: Specification Strength

Alternatives including "Specification Required", "No Registration
Required", "FCFS", were discussed.

No consensus detected.


Topic: Early Dialog Termination with 199
Led by Christer Holmberg
Slides presented
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-sip-199-02.txt

Issue: Is there a constituency for this work?

Noted by chairs that we had previously taken a poll on the topic, but
that very few people seem engaged in the work.

Chairs took a poll on interest levels, and "don't care" was observed
as the loudest of the results.

Noted that 3GPP has adopted the approach.

Noted that AT&T expects to be requiring this optimization from
vendors.

Noted that the draft is less interetsing if it does not solve
HERFP. There had been agreement in SIPPING not to work on a general
solution for HERFP. Therefore, the scope of this work was reduced to
exclude HERFP.

Discussion about the benefits of the optimization provided by the
draft ensued. These discussions were inconclusive.

Interested parties are asked to discuss constituency on-list.



Session 2, Thursday, November 21, 1300-1500 Salon D


Topic: Agenda and Announcements
Led by Chairs
Slides presented (one deck, same as Session 1)

Issue: SIP Location Conveyance

A revised draft was submitted Nov. 19. The WG is asked to review it.


Issue: draft-ua-sip-privacy, BCP or Info.

Concerned parties are asked to discuss on list, with the "default"
option being Info.


Topic: SIP Draft Stadnards Work
Led by Robert Sparks
No slides
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-sparks-sip-steps-to-draft-00.txt

Issue: Should we go for draft?

Extensive discussion ensued, with many opinions offered.

There seems to be a general cosnensus that some part of the work,
perhaps SDP and Offer-Answr, or perhaps the grammar, can be carved off
and worked on independently. However, there is no conclusion on the
larger question.

Robert proposed that we concentrate in the near term on collecting
interoperability statements and essential corrections. We shall also
continue to discuss revisable sections of work. Robert will act as a
facilitator for this effort.


Topic: Keepalive Without Outbound
Led by Christer Holmberg
Slides presented
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-holmberg-sip-keep-02.txt

Christer reviewed problem statement and scope of work, including a
presentation of use cases. Four requirements are presented in the
slides.

Issue: Requirements

We seem to have general consensus on Req 1-3, but not 4. Hadriel also
thinks there is a missing requirement on negotiating the frequency of
refresh.

Issue: Can we add this back to outbound?

Noted that this approach was rejected earlier in the outbound
work. However, the most recent Outbound editor (Francois Audet) claims
that Outbound has left a hook for thsi approach, and supports it going
forward as a separate document. Also noted that some participants
don't care about Outbound, but do need keepalive negotiation.

Poll: How many people have ready the draft? Chair noted the result as
a "fair number", indicating more than expected.

Poll: Are there questions in the draft that we should solve? Chair
noted the result as "rough consensus".

Poll; Do we have consensus on the proposed mecahnism: Answer "No".


Topic: Return Routability Check Using RFC 4235, aka DERIVE
Led by Victor Pascual =C1vila
Slides Presented
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kuthan-sip-derive-00.txt

Issue: Does sending a DERIVE check tell the caller he isn't trusted?

Discussion conoted that if one is sending a DERIVE check to every
caller that doesn't use RFC 4474, this isn't a statement of distrust.

Issue: E.164 numbers

Since we are unlikely to have return-routability to a phone number,
this mechanism doesn't seem to work there. Or at least it proves
nothing about the identity of the caller, although it might (with a
GRUU) get us a UA-liveness check.

Issue: B2BUA/SBCs

Will B2BUAs respond on behalf of the calling party? If they do, is the
result useful? Opinions expressed on both sides, with the usefulness
dependent on which SBC responds. If it is the caller's SBC, the result
might be useful. If it is the called SBC, the result probably
isn't useful. And we have no way for the UAS to determine which case
occurred, short of an RFC 4474 signature on the response, which would
have made the whole thing moot anyhow. No consensus noted on resolving
this issue. (Editor note: this is isomorphic to the E.164 identity
problem, good luck on solving it!).

Noted that Security Considerations section needs work.

Issue: Requirements

EKR proposed that we are thrashing in the solution space with adequate
requirements here. What exactly are we trying to solve?

Discussion ensued, with a wide range of positions noted.

Noted that return rouatbility checks have proven useful in other
spaces.

Noted that if this works with off-the-sehf UAs, then the incentive
structure is right: the party doing the added work (called) is the one
that gets the benefit from it. This is the inverse of the RFC 4474.

No final consensus noted.


Topic: Path forward on Identity Issues
Led by Jon Peterson
Slides Presented
No draft

Issue: Desirable Properties

Desirable properties:
- Generality =96 one universal mechanism is a good thing.
- Avoids bid-downs.
- Authentication
- enables media security
- useful to decide whether or not to accept a request

Hadriel noted that these are all good, but we can't have them. What
are we willing to settle for tha twe can actually deliver? Several
others voiced similar positions on the "noble but futile" theme.

Issue: Configurability

Proposed that some level of flexibility on what headers get signed
might be acceptable.

Hadriel suggested that we come up with a set of rules that
intermediaries could comply with. Sam Hartman suggested that we
further need a compromise about what we need to sign to get secure
media that shows up as secure on the other end, with a spec that
provides it. If we can't get it in this working group, we may need
work that spans the entire IETF to get it.

Further discussion ensued.

No conclusions were noted.

It's not end to end. If your UAS is checking RFC 4474, it's going to  
reject the call.

Now, did you WANT a DTLS-SRTP media fingerprint? If so, then you need  
RFC 4474 end-to-end.

Hi all,

I had a quick query on History-Info (RFC 4244). Apologies if this has
been discussed already. If so, I would be grateful if you could
provide the pointer to the relevant thread.

Once a proxy determines that it may include the History-Info header
for a particular request (based on local policy, privacy settings etc)
should it insert a History-Info header only if the proxy had done a
retargeting for this request? Or should it insert a History-Info
header irrespective of whether the request uri is changed by itself or
not?

The following text in the RFC: "Note that in the case of loose
routing, the Request-URI does not change during the forwarding of a
Request; thus, the capturing of History-Info for such a request would
result in duplicate Request-URIs with different indices." seems to
suggest that the proxy should always insert the History-Info header
even if the Request-URI is not changed. Is this understanding correct?

Thanks and Regards,
Siddharth

It can be even a proxy (well if we consider it then still legitimate enough
to call it a "SIP proxy" if it rewrites SDP).

That's a scenario which indeed DOES work -- SDP rewriting occurs before 
signing
and there is no further rewriting before verification. Our 
implementation is done
the way it works under these assumptions.

In detail: caller's proxy thinks the caller is behind a NAT and decides to
rewrite  SDP in INVITE  to include an RTP relay's address in it. it signs
the modified SDP. Note that message integrity check refers to what this 
proxy
is receiving, not sending...which is still fine (at least for me). It 
forwards
to recepient's proxy, which verifies the SDP. Then it can even rewrite 
it too
(for sake of callee's NAT traversal for example) --  as long as downstream
entities trust this proxy to have done its verification job.

The problem is the assumption that we can manage to get the signer and 
verifier
next to each other without an SDP rewriter in between them. It goes too 
far in the
field despite I find it unfortunate. Shortly, there are incredibly many
"middleboxes" that stand in the way and change the SDP.   These include:
SIP-aware firewalls (ALGs are IMO plain broken vehicle but they are in the
field), SBCs,  load-balancers, and transcoders.

To make it clear: I don't think that the 4474 architecture is broken, I 
think
that the assumption of the SIP path not being broken is too brittle. I was
initially hopeful that one could put 4474 in the administrative borders
so that interdomain trust is not damaged by intermediary SDP rewrites.
Unfortunately it seems that in the field any "atomic" link can be
still broken by some SDP re-writers.

The "right" architectural fix would be to make sure that there are no 
SDP rewrites
between signer and verifier (much weaker assumption than end-2-end SDP 
integrity)
which is IMO doable but is for some reason not being done. In lieu of which,
I think giving up on SDP integrity would allow better penetration by 
being more
robust against such networks.

If the proxy is supporting History-Info, it should add a header for
every retarget or forwarding of a Request.  For Loose routing, the proxy
is retargeting - it's just capturing the next hop in the Route header
only. The text in RFC 4244 indicates that with Loose Routing, the
Request-URI is the same in each entry, but you do still get information
as to the number of hops, etc. This could still be useful to some
applications - for example, you can still build the tree for the path of
the request. Obviously, there are some limitations to the usability of
H-I in these cases. 

There is text in RFC 4244 in section 4.3.3.1 that specifies H-I is added
as a request is forwarded, so it should insert H-I irrespective of
whether the Request URI has changed as you suggest below. 

It might be helpful to both add an example showing how the trees of the
path of the request are helpful, as well as showing an example in the
case of loose routing when we update RFC 4244. 

And, perhaps something to clarify is that in the case of loose routing
the hops are reflected in the Route Header. 

Regards,
Mary.

Subject: [Sip] Query on History-Info.

Hi all,

I had a quick query on History-Info (RFC 4244). Apologies if this has
been discussed already. If so, I would be grateful if you could provide
the pointer to the relevant thread.

Once a proxy determines that it may include the History-Info header for
a particular request (based on local policy, privacy settings etc)
should it insert a History-Info header only if the proxy had done a
retargeting for this request? Or should it insert a History-Info header
irrespective of whether the request uri is changed by itself or not?

The following text in the RFC: "Note that in the case of loose routing,
the Request-URI does not change during the forwarding of a Request;
thus, the capturing of History-Info for such a request would result in
duplicate Request-URIs with different indices." seems to suggest that
the proxy should always insert the History-Info header even if the
Request-URI is not changed. Is this understanding correct?

Thanks and Regards,
Siddharth

[JRE] I am not sure you need RFC 4474 end-to-end - you just need
something end-to-end that binds the fingerprint of the DTLS-SRTP
certificate to a substantial part of the SIP message, but that need not
include the entire SDP.

I don't disagree about what we MIGHT need, but what we DO need, given  
what we wrote into the dtls-srtp spec, is RFC 4474 all the way to the  
UAS.

All of these go together in explaining why we have no deployments of  
RFC 4474 and no deployments of DTLS-SRTP worth mentioning.

Apparently, people prefer public discourse with anonymous/unidentified  
parties. Given what I hear about college sex lives these days, I  
shouldn't be surprised.

        Updates:    RFC3261

        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-sip-fork-loop-fix-08.txt

        URL:        http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5393.txt

This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP
proxy behavior.  This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP
networks where a small number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP
requests can stimulate massive amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic.

This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies
when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one
destination).  It also corrects and clarifies the description of the
loop-detection algorithm such proxies are required to implement.
Additionally, this document defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for
limiting the number of concurrent branches pursued for any given
request.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

STANDARDS TRACK: This document specifies an Internet standards track
protocol for the Internet community,and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the Internet
Official Protocol Standards (STD 1) for the standardization state and
status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Is there ever a case where a UAC would generate a request with the same Call-ID as a previous request, but a different from-tag?

Registration, but I think that is probably out of scope for what you are
considering!

In the reverse direction, the presence of a to-tag in a request
indicates an in-dialog request.  Therefore, requiring a from-tag ensures
that requests in the reverse direction can have a to-tag, and thus be
correctly treated as in-dialog.

Presumably null-auth will only work if the perpetrator of the nuisance
calls doesn't take advantage of the text:
# The client could also provide the Null credentials immediately if
# it knows that it has no other credentials, avoiding an extra
# round-trip delay.

Maybe the null challenge should round-trip a nonce.  At least that would
show the challenge got back to somewhere useful.

I'm looking at the code in sipX that works with tags to determine the
status of a SIP message, and though the from-tag is not logically
necessary, it does make the code simpler, as the To and From URIs are
handled more symmetrically.

In addition, it allows the SIP element to extract and compare only the
tags, rather than having to compare the To/From URIs (as is required in
RFC 2543), which is always fraught with problems.

Hi Hadriel,

 > reading into it what I want to and not what it really says.

the draft already talks about contexts:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-body-handling-05#section-8.1

I would like to agree on a concrete way forward. Do you think we should 
add something to the body handling draft? Maybe expand the information 
on contexts? Maybe provide guidelines for extension developers so that 
they take them into account when defining new extensions?

Thanks,

Gonzalo

The target is the specific message processor/state-machine for that method, but for any/all packages/sub-contexts.  For example the Event and Subscription-State headers are for this context in a SUBSCRIBE.  For methods that don't have a package (INV/UPD/ACK/PRA/MSG), the method-only-context and user-context are the same.  So the "session" and "early-session" C-D's are really for a user-context, but it's the same context as method-only-context.  I don't know of any bodies which are currently only for a method-only-context.(?)  Nor am I convinced we even need this context to be defined separately.

The mandatory SIP headers (Call-ID, To, From, etc.) are examples of things targeted for this context.  An AIB, geoloc, and maybe sipfrag(?) bodies are targets for this context.

>

> 1) Any body-part with a C-D of "render", means to render it to the "user" - not the human user, but the *user-context*.  This lets us get backwards-compatibility for free, because a C-D of "render" is implicit and what current SIP messages actually have and UA's expect.  That C-D becomes the "default" so to speak, which it already is today.
> 
> 2) Any package (event of info) can define additional C-D's that belong to it, just like they can define C-T's that they support.  I am not entirely thrilled with letting packages define C-D's, but some already do ("signal", for example).  If we'd rather just grandfather those and say no more that's fine.  ISTM that a package could get that semantic purpose information from within the boy content itself (in XML, for example) if it really needs such.  Methods already do too, like "session" or "early-session".  If we decide packages can have their own C-D's, then we need additional rules not to step on body parts for others, but I'll skip that for now.
> 
> 3) Any body-part that is NOT for the user-context, for example a geoloc, needs to disambiguate itself from the rest, by using a C-D other than "render" or the ones already defined.  If it needs a sub-context other than the all-messages-context, or is in fact tied to a SIP header, then it needs to use CID, and a C-D of "by-reference".  I would in fact suggest that all future extensions which need to be for something other than the user-context MUST have a referencing SIP header and use a CID and a C-D of by-reference.
> 
> 4) Furthermore, any future extension which is not for the user-context MUST NOT use any C-T currently defined in any RFC or WG draft for SIP, including already defined event-packages.  That sounds harsh, but that's what we need to do to get a very high degree of backwards-compatibility I think.  So this means you can't do a geoloc-type thing using "text/plain", for example, or really even "application/pidf+xml", which is what geoloc currently uses in its draft.  And body-handling or some other draft should list all such C-T's, so future extensions can know the list to avoid.  And if we want to just say no C-T currently define by IANA period, I'm fine with that too.  Note this does NOT prevent future SIP RFCs from using a C-T defined by such an extension as geoloc.  For example, if geoloc uses "application/foobar", then a future Event-package could use that too; because that future event package would normatively reference body-handling.
> 
> 5) IF we need an option tag (and I do NOT think we do), then we should create one and only one tag right now, for the body-handling draft's logic.  Future extensions which are not for the user-context would then NOT need more option tags simply due to body-handling issues, but can use that generic one.  I would also put in some extreme language into the body-handling option tag about what it means to put such a thing in a Require header, to dissuade people from doing that.
> 
> 6) If there are some already defined things which do not follow the above rules, we either (a) grandfather them into body-handling right now, or if they're not really in use, then either (b) deprecate or (c) replace them. (and I would vote for (b), fwiw)

Chair: Keith Drage.

Participants: Adam Uzelac, Hannes Tschofenig, Kai Fischer, Dan York,
Jonathan Rosenberg, Hadriel Kaplan, Victor Pascual Avila.

Background:
See attached emails from Keith.

Topics to discuss:
- Can we get the problem we are trying to solve into a single I-D?
- Is there any consolidation or elimination with current drafts that we
can usefully do at present?

Discussion:
Need to convince the ADs of what the problem is.

How do we convey a more secure version of caller ID given the problem of
middleboxes?

Hannes: The world uses PAI today and people are happy, that is the
present business model. So this isn't a problem that needs solving right
now.

Other opinions: On the other hand we don't have interconnect yet, and
when we do we will need stronger mechanisms. So a chicken and egg
situation.

Question of what relates to identity, e.g., media.

Hannes: Need to capture economic and commercial side-effects, not just
technical issues.

Adam: Carriers are largely used just for PSTN access today, but as
carrier use extends, and as enterprises start wanting the caller ID
delivered e2e, then the problem will start to hit carriers.

Hadriel: This is a problem that I would like to fix before it arises and
hits the press. Also the solution will take a long time to standardise
and then to deploy.

Dan: We need a plan, and need to work on a solution, else it will
seriously impact the deployment of SIP.

Chair: Which of the present drafts would be the best starting point for
capturing problem statement?

Agreed to take the e2e-identity-important draft from John as the
starting point. Should be more emphasis on the fact that certain actions
of middleboxes are legitimate and the solutions needs to work still in
these environments. Should ensure all problem statement aspects are
captured (including those from the various other drafts), but leaving
out those aspects that are better left in the other drafts. Focus only
on the problem and strip out any solution stuff. Use the problem
statement to identify requirements, which for now can perhaps be left as
an appendix. Dan and Adam will help John to develop this draft.
Concerning Hannes' concern, the identified requirements should say what
is urgent and what is not urgent to fix.

Victor: Unclear at present whether this is a single problem with a
single set of requirements, or perhaps two problems (one of which is
addressed by DERIVE). Agreed DERIVE supporters should contribute into
the problem statement / requirements work.

There as no opinion on whether anything from the SAML draft needs to go
into the discussion.

The dates proposed by Keith for further calls (13th January, 27th
January, 17th February) at 15.30 GMT were confirmed. Duration will be 1
hour.

Thoughts on what should/should not be in the next revision of
e2e-identity-important should be sent to John, Adam, Dan and others by
6th January, so that a proposed plan for the next revision can be
brought to the call on 13th January.

For ongoing email communication, use the list of invitees for
communication within the design team, but anything of wider impact use
the SIP list.

John

I plan to have a sequence of conference calls on identity issues before =
the next IETF meeting to see if we can come up with something that might =
result in a real conclusion in the next IETF meeting. Treat this as an =
informal design team.

If you think someone is missing from the to list above, send me a =
message with a name and an email address, and I will invite. This is =
basically the authors of all the drafts we have had on identity related =
subjects plus others.

Currently I think we need to do two things:

-	Get to the bottom of the problem that we are trying to solve. Looking =
for a single internet draft on this. Who will author.

-	Consolidate or eliminate (where appropriate) the various solution =
drafts. Request updates based on various comments made. Identify where =
they meet the problem statement.

Please send me a mail if you intend to participate in the 1st call. As =
it is short notice, I will have to cancel if key people do not =
participate, but I would like to get something going before Christmas =
and the proposed slot would appear to be the only slot before we are =
into Christmas.

I would like someone to volunteer to take notes.

I plan to go ahead with the first call, but there are apparently going =
to be some significant voices missing.

I therefore intend to keep it short and as an exchange of views on which =
drafts (if any) people should do some work on over Christmas.

Cullen continues to say that we have not yet got tot he root of the =
issue by identifying what problem we need to fix, and therefore any =
draft people propose to progress needs the material in this area beefing =
up.

Current active drafts are (not sure I have caught them all - please =
add):

http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-asserter-identity-00.txt
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-session-id-01.txt
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-elwell-sip-e164-problem-statement-01.txt
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important-01.txt
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-elwell-sip-identity-handling-ua-00.txt
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kuthan-sip-derive-00.txt

I have not included the saml documents.

Maybe we could also take a look at Jon Peterson's slides and identify =
any impact of these comments:

 From tags exist because we put the response-to-forked-request  
disambiguator in the To-tag and needed
to be able later to send a request in the other direction - and we  
needed to do this in a way that was backward
compatible with the 2543 (and a few slightly pre-2543) things around  
at the time.

If I remember things correctly, there was a rev of bis briefly that  
defined to-tags but didn't have from-tags in it at all.
And I _vaguely_ remember discussing the alternative of putting this  
info on the Call-ID in the response instead of To,
but that fell away to some backwards-compatibility problems (but I  
could be misremembering).

Sorry for the slight deviation from topic, but its probably worth re- 
highlighting here
that CANCEL is hop-hop and isn't capable of carrying information end- 
end (like what
you'd expect to see when using SDP). ACK-non200 is similar.

I think that's really a question for the others (Paul, Dean, Eric).  I interpreted body-handling to address the issue already, but maybe not the backward compatibility issue.

Also, section 8.1. talks about the context being defined by the method, C-D and C-T.  It should probably mention that the Event package for SUB/NOT/PUB and soon the Info-Event package narrows the context further.  And I'm not sure that C-T has anything to do with defining a context.

RFC 3986 defines the following grammar for a URI:

   URI           =3D scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   hier-part     =3D "//" authority path-abempty
                 / path-absolute
                 / path-rootless
                 / path-empty

A SIP URI falls into the 'path-rootless' rule:


   path-rootless =3D segment-nz *( "/" segment )


   segment-nz    =3D 1*pchar


   pchar         =3D unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"


   pct-encoded   =3D "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG



   unreserved    =3D ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"


   sub-delims    =3D "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"

                 / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=3D"

path-rootless does not allow "[" or "]" characters, so the SIP-URI grammar =
for IPV6 violates RFC 3986 grammar.

SIP-URI          =3D  "sip:" [ userinfo ] hostport
                    uri-parameters [ headers ]

hostport         =3D  host [ ":" port ]
host             =3D  hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
hostname         =3D  *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
domainlabel      =3D  alphanum
                    / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
toplabel         =3D  ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
IPv4address    =3D  1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
IPv6reference  =3D  "[" IPv6address "]"  <-- *** violates RFC 3986 ***
IPv6address    =3D  hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
hexpart        =3D  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
hexseq         =3D  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
hex4           =3D  1*4HEXDIG
port           =3D  1*DIGIT


These, though valid SIP URIs are not valid URIs:

    <sip:[2001:db8::10]>
    <sip:caller@[2001:db8::1]>

Has this already been addressed?

Regards,
Mike

Folks: The minutes, slides, and audio files for the individual
SIP sessions for IETF 73 (Minneapolis) are now available at
http://www.softarmor.com/mediawiki/index.php/SIP_Audio_for_IETF_73

Note that we are missing the audio for the second SIP session.
We have launched a massive search for it, but so far, no one has
been able to find it.  If it does turn up, I'll put it on
the media page.  Until then, you will have to make do with the
minutes and slides.

Happy holidays.

Greetings,

Mike's interpretation looks correct.  Is this something that should be
fixed?  If so, should the fix be placed within
draft-ietf-sip-ipv6-abnf-fix?

Thanks,
Brett

	To: SIP@ietf.org
	Subject: [Sip] Question regarding conflicting grammar for IPV6
SIP URI andRFC 3986
=09
=09

	RFC 3986 defines the following grammar for a URI:

	=20

	   URI           =3D scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#"
fragment ]

	=20

	   hier-part     =3D "//" authority path-abempty

	                 / path-absolute

	                 / path-rootless

	                 / path-empty

	=20

	A SIP URI falls into the 'path-rootless' rule:

	=20

	   path-rootless =3D segment-nz *( "/" segment )

	=20

	   segment-nz    =3D 1*pchar

	=20

	   pchar         =3D unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" /
"@"

	=20

	   pct-encoded   =3D "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
	=20
	   unreserved    =3D ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

	=20

	   sub-delims    =3D "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
	                 / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=3D"

	=20

	path-rootless does not allow "[" or "]" characters, so the
SIP-URI grammar for IPV6 violates RFC 3986 grammar.

	=20

	SIP-URI          =3D  "sip:" [ userinfo ] hostport

	                    uri-parameters [ headers ]

	=20

	hostport         =3D  host [ ":" port ]

	host             =3D  hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference

	hostname         =3D  *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]

	domainlabel      =3D  alphanum

	                    / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum

	toplabel         =3D  ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum

	IPv4address    =3D  1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "."
1*3DIGIT

	IPv6reference  =3D  "[" IPv6address "]"  <-- *** violates RFC 3986
***

	IPv6address    =3D  hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]

	hexpart        =3D  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [
hexseq ]

	hexseq         =3D  hex4 *( ":" hex4)

	hex4           =3D  1*4HEXDIG

	port           =3D  1*DIGIT

	=20

	=20

	These, though valid SIP URIs are not valid URIs:

	=20

	    <sip:[2001:db8::10]>

	    <sip:caller@[2001:db8::1]>

	=20

	Has this already been addressed?

	=20

	Regards,

	Mike

Brett Tate found the audio file for the second session (thanks, Brett).

The complete media links for both the SIP sessions in IETF 73

Funny - this just came up in another conversation I was having.
It was pointed out to me that the 3261 ABNF for the sip URI is probably =

derived from RFC-2396 which has since been obsoleted by RFC-3986. =

RFC-3987 explicitly allows the [ ] notation for IPv6.

So yeah, the URL syntax should probably be corrected.

What should the fix be?  Mike's claim is that rfc3261
violates rfc3986, yet rfc3986 is internally consistent
in that it requires IPv6 literals to be enclosed in "[" and "]",
viz:

    IP-literal = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"

At the same time, rfc3261 is internally consistent in that
it requires IPv6reference to be enclosed in "[" and "]", viz:

   IPv6reference  =  "[" IPv6address "]"

Furthermore, I don't think the intent is to produce SIP-URI (as
defined in rfc3261) from a URI (as defined in rfc3986), is it?
Note that rfc3986 defines URI as:

   URI = scheme ":" hier-part ...
   heir-part = "//" ...

If this was true, a SIP URI would need to be produced as:

   sip://[2001:db8:10] ...

In other words, I am trying to understand what the exact
problem is before we try to figure out where to put the
fix in...

Thanks,

Intentional or not, the sip-uri (excluding IPv6reference) appears to not
violate extending rfc2396's absoluteURI because the definition was a
structured subset of opaque_part.  However the introduction of brackets
to enclose an IPv6 address causes the sip-uri to no longer be a valid
absoluteURI (rfc2396) or absolute-URI (rfc3986).

I'm currently not sure if a fix is really needed or how best to correct
it.  Escaping the brackets might work; however that might cause more
headaches.

Section 19.1.2 of 3261:
   Note that character escaping is not allowed in the host component of
   a SIP or SIPS URI (the % character is not valid in its expansion).

RFC3896, section 3.2.2 says:

"A host identified by an Internet Protocol literal address, version 6
   [RFC3513] or later, is distinguished by enclosing the IP literal
   within square brackets ("[" and "]").  This is the only place where
   square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax."

It looks like RFC3896 has the error, the definition for URI needs to updated
to be the following:

     URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

      hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty
                  / authority

The SIP URI is not the only one with this problem - RFC 3860 (im-URI), RFC 3859 (pres-URI), RFC 3508 (h323-URI), and who knows what else violate that rule.

Seems to me any "fixing" should be done to RFC 3986, probably as an errata.

3986 accomodates IPv6 addresses within in "authority" which seems to 
serve roughly the same role as "[ userinfo ] hostport" in SIP-URI. But 
"authority" is always preceded by "//", so it doesn't work for sip.

To fit a sip uri within 3986 I think you must start with:

    URI           = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

    hier-part     = path-rootless

    path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )

    segment-nz    = 1*pchar

    pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"

    unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

Not only does the above exclude the IPv6 syntax, it also excludes lots 
of other things that are commonly used in the userinfo portion of sip URIs.

I don't know if this is of practical concern or not. The SIP URI is 
defined by 3261. Certainly 3261 didn't call for it to be compatible with 
3986. Yet it would be *nice* if it was for compatibility with software 
that treats URIs, including SIP URIs generically. But I don't know how 
important that is in practice.

To fit 3986 well, I think would have to aim for fitting into:

       URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

       hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty

       authority   = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

But that would require SIP-URIs like sip://alice@atlanta.com
and I don't think we are going to migrate to that any time soon.

Don't mailto URIs have similar problems? What are they doing about it?

	Thanks,
	Paul

Hello Alice

Christmas is the time to get Ro lex watch, and the only place to get top notch watches that look and perform exactly like the originals is
http://www.clipslim.com/

The best news is that in December you can buy two watches and get an extra 15% off your purchase!
http://www.clipslim.com/

Our Ro lex have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Lim

Like what?  The following is the sub-delims expansion:

sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" /
"="

I assume sip is not the only URI with the issue; however I haven't
checked.

All: So, to summarize a WG position on this and chart a course
forward to close this item, these are the facts:

1) RFC3261 is internally consistent in specifying IPv6 literals
  (i.e., enclosed in "[" and "]").

2) RFC3986 is internally consistent in IPv6 literals as well.

3) It was not the intention of rfc3261 to make the SIP URI
  compatible with rfc2396 URI (rfc3986 came later.)  And in fact,
  if we made the SIP URI compatible with rfc3986, we won't get
  too far for the reason I pointed out early:

     Note that rfc3986 defines URI as:

       URI = scheme ":" hier-part ...
       heir-part = "//" ...

     If this was true, a SIP URI would need to be produced as:

       sip://[2001:db8:10] ...

  Which, I presume, is not going to happen any time soon (and
  as Hadriel points out, other URIs (im, pres, etc.) suffer
  the same fate.

Therefore, the only conclusion we can arrive to is that
rfc3986 should be modified.

If so, then what should the modification be and who should
do it?  For the "who": Given that rfc3986 did not come out of a
WG, there is no mailing list to address this issue on.  So,
the best we can do is as Hadriel suggested: issue an errata.

For the "what", any suggestions?  I think Hisham's suggestion
is probably the least intrusive one to rfc3986's ABNF while
allowing one to generate rfc3261 SIP URIs.  To recap:

OLD:
URI           = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
hier-part     = "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty
authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

NEW:
URI           = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
hier-part     =  "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty
                  / authority   ***** Newly added line *****

authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

Does this cause any other problems?

Thoughts, comments?  If you agree, please say so; that way
we can summarize this as the WG position allowing for the
next steps to happen (i.e., file errata, etc.)

Thanks,

- vijay

Vijay,

I agree with the direction - to change 3986.
I *think* the proposed syntax sounds right, though I haven't studied the 
grammar carefully to ensure that it is then unambiguous. (But I think I 
recall seeing that it is already ambiguous and falls back on the "first 
matching production wins" to resolve that conflict.)

	Thanks,
	Paul

It's ambiguous with path-rootless, no?
But anyway I think the AD's should weigh in on what WG should work on the fix.  The fix needs to be applicable to all URIs, and I don't think we have all the right folks to know what the rfc3986 semantics really means generally.

I don't think so.  I don't think you can generate a token with
"[" and "]" using the path-rootless production rule (unless
they are escaped.)

Understood; however, I was asked by the chairs to round up
a WG summary on this one.  I suspect that once we do so,
the chairs will get the ADs involved to move this along in
the shape they see fit.

Hence, please do eyeball the path-rootless production rule
and make sure my understanding is correct.

Thanks,

Right, but I meant it's ambiguous when it's NOT an IPv6 address.  Which will probably be a lot of the time. :)

Also, I don't really understand what the semantics means for "authority" vs. "path-rootless" in that RFC as defined.  What does an app do differently in those two cases?

OK, I see what you mean, and I am not sure I have a good
answer, either.

Presumably we (i.e., the SIP WG) can provide a statement
on why we think that rfc3986 should be changed, and how it
can be changed, but here is a (hopefully small) list of
potential questions and side-effects we don't have an answer
to.

Then have someone in the right authority arbitrate the ABNF
fix.

Thanks,

Personally, I think the URI/v6 problem has a very large scope. I'd be  
tempted to raise the question on the IETF general list and ask where  
the work should go.

Let's get a grip on the origin of the problem.

The generic URI grammar was stimulated by HTTP URIs.  They assume that
*if* the URI contains the designation of a host, it will be flagged by
the initial "//" -- and the syntax allows "all the standard syntaxes for
hosts" in that location.  Now if SIP URIs we constructed on that format,
we'd have "sip://dworley@nortel.com".  But I don't expect that to change
any time soon.

So let's ask, why are SIP URIs written as they are?  Clearly, it's
because they're based on e-mail addresses, or rather, the "mailto:" URI
scheme:  "mailto:dworley@nortel.com --> sip:dworley@nortel.com".  Hmmm,
doesn't that mean that mailto: URIs have the same problem?  And, as
Hadriel notes, *all* the URIs based on the mailto: URI?  What have the
"mailto" people done about this?

That doesn't take long to look up:  Page 2 of RFC 2368 says:

     mailtoURL  =  "mailto:" [ to ] [ headers ]
     to         =  #mailbox
     headers    =  "?" header *( "&" header )
     header     =  hname "=" hvalue
     hname      =  *urlc
     hvalue     =  *urlc

   "#mailbox" is as specified in RFC 822 [RFC822]. This means that it
   consists of zero or more comma-separated mail addresses, possibly
   including "phrase" and "comment" components. Note that all URL
   reserved characters in "to" must be encoded: in particular,
   parentheses, commas, and the percent sign ("%"), which commonly occur
   in the "mailbox" syntax.

So if you want an IPv6 address in your mailto: URI, you're going to have
to write the [...] as %5b...%5d.

As far as I can tell, the only reason that this rule does not extend
(uniformly!) to SIP URIs is that RFC 3261 explicitly forbids it.
Perhaps we could allow %-escapes in host-parts as part of the IPv6
upgrades to our software...

Dale

URI's would be the domain of APPS, I would think. Introducing the Apps  
AD's to the conversation.

Hi all,
    Please have a look, is following request valid?
There is a horizontal tab preceding each extra line in To header.

*According RFC 3261 section 7.3.1 Header Field Format* description, "Header

at least one SP or horizontal tab (HT)", above request is valid, right?

Hi all,

WIth my AD hat on ...

If you want to update/discuss/change/abuse 3986, probably the best  
place to to that would be on the APPS area list at apps-discuss@ietf.org

It would be up to the Apps ADs, but I suspect that change to the BNF  
suggested below is too significant a change to be done with an Errata.

Dear Darin,

How about buying yourself a two Tag Heuer watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks
http://www.clipcape.com/

Take an extra 15% off your purchase during month of December.
http://www.clipcape.com/

Our Tag Heuer watches have perfect weight and feel same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Schulz
