From: Chairs, SIP, SIPPING, and SIMPLE Working Groups of the Internet 
Engineering Task Force
Cc:   Area Directors, Transport Area, Internet Engineering Steering Group
To: CN and SA Working Groups of the Third-Generation Partnership Program
Subject: Liaison Statement on Interoperability Issues and SIP in IMS

I. Introduction

The IETF is made up of working groups, such as the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) Working Group, and these are supervised by the
Internet Engineering Steering Group, or IESG, whose goals
include maintaining technical quality and assuring that
its work is consistent with the "big picture" of Internet principles
and architecture.  The IETF also has the Internet Architecture
Board, or IAB, ensuring the big picture is clear.

The IESG's Area Director for SIP, and the IESG as a whole have given
repeated guidance to the SIP Working Group in the process of development 
and
approval of the consensus standards such as RFC 3261, during which
several points have been raised that we believe are related to the usage
of SIP in the Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) specifications
being developed in 3GPP.  Our goal is to communicate these points at a
technical level, from the consensus of our approved standards, as
the Working Group chairs, to you as counterpart technical Working Group
chairs.  We wish to convey introductory points here, points about
interoperability in section 2, and specific issues about the IETF
SIP standards in section 3.

The key guidance is:


a) Internet standards are intended to have broad applicability for all
    aspects of the Internet, including private networks that use IP,
    whether or not connected to the public network. Developing
    "profiles"--subsets of or exceptions to these standards, whether
    for use on public or private networks, is dangerous because of
    the very high probability that such profiles will be incompatible
    with those deployed on the Internet as a whole, and we have
    learned that networks which are disconnected today somehow
    become connected tomorrow.  Thus inter-operability remains
    a critical issue, even for currently disconnected networks.

b) Any implementation of a protocol claimed or named to be an Internet
    protocol, such as SIP, should be greatly consistent with both the
    specification and the practice of that protocol on the Internet. If
    an implementation doesn't interoperate, and/or does not operate
    (if suitably configured) in general Internet environments, it
    is actually a separate protocol and should not be advertised or
    named the same as an implementation of an Internet protocol.

We believe that 3GPP chose to use SIP and other Internet protocols in
the IMS specification not only as a matter of expedient reuse, but
because of advantages such as interoperability, open
specification, and widespread deployment offered by these
protocols. Further, we believe that 3GPP's choice was influenced by
the expectation that these Internet advantages would lead to benefits
such as reduced systems cost, access to a wide variety of applications
being developed around the Internet, and the consequent ability to
develop and offer new value-added applications to wireless subscribers
and generate new revenue for wireless operators. We support this
choice and rationale, and welcome 3GPP as a collaborator in making the
best possible use of our protocols. To that end, we welcome 3GPP input
on requirements for the unique aspects of their environment, in the 
further
development of SIP and other Internet protocols, and look forward to
collaborating with 3GPP to facilitate developing the best understanding
for all about how best to configure SIP and other Internet protocols for
interoperability between the IM subsystem and the Internet.

II. Interoperability Issues

Careful review of published IMS specifications, by knowledgeable
individuals who participate in both 3GPP and IETF, has raised
certain concerns relating to interoperability (both in terms of a and b)
between IMS and the Internet.  The Chairs of the IETF SIP and
SIPPING Working Groups offer this liaison statement as guidance and
suggestions to 3GPP, in hopes of assuring effective interoperability.
We realize that some of these concerns stem from recent enhancements
to the SIP protocol, and cannot be immediately rectified in the IMS
specifications, whereas other concerns may be more readily
addressable. We encourage 3GPP to address these concerns to the
extent possible in IMS Release 5, and to address them and any
underlying issues before the finalization of IMS Release 6. We will
assist wherever reasonably possible, and welcome further
involvement with 3GPP to resolve these concerns.

In general, we would like 3GPP to consider two interopability goals:

1) While operator and business policy configurations (which are
    not matters of IETF concern) may prevent such behavior,
    the IMS specification itself should not prevent the possibility that
    an IMS user can access SIP services on the Internet, or establish
    SIP sessions with users on the Internet. This should be possible
    without requiring that some sort of application-level-gateway to
    modify the IMS protocols. In most cases, we expect that an IMS
    user should be able to access Internet applications even if there
    is no explicit support in IMS for that application.  This implies that
    IMS users have access to complete SIP implementations including
    security capabilities.

2) The SIP specification (RFC 3261) and the other related IETF
    standards allow for building strong and secure Internet applications.
    An IMS operator should be able to buy an off-the-shelf, IETF
    standard, commercial SIP system that implements the RFCs related
    to SIP, and which also has support for IMS-specific capabilites,
    plug it in, use configuration options to set up policies, and make
    it work in IMS systems.  Configuration and local policies would 
establish
    what local authentication, authorization, AAA, reporting, SIP
    P-headers, and other options are used that might not be widely
    implemented in the Internet--or indeed are not in the case of 
P-headers.
    Vendors building an IMS system should not need to build two
    completely separate products to address IMS and SIP in the Internet.
    The key point here is that there should be little or no difference
    other than the configuration choices conceptually in an
    implementation used in IMS and one used outside IMS.  This would
    be an ideal interoperability goal, and well suited to the IETF's
    orientation of standardizing what is implemented and available
    to the operator or user of the equipment (e.g. minimum
    mandatory to implement strong security), not what is used or how
    it is used.


III. Specific Concerns on SIP in IMS Release 5

The following discusses some of our technical concerns with IMS. It
should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of
issues. It is intended primarily to introduce the types of
behaviors that concern us and the probable impact of these behaviors
on interoperability. However, where specific issues are illustrated,
we request specific consideration of these concerns by 3GPP.


There are three general classes of issues that we have identified:

1. IMS Call State Control Function (CSCF) nodes send messages that
    the SIP RFCs reserve to User Agents without implementing
    the functions required for User Agents. There is some 3GPP
    view that this is justified by viewing the CSCF as a "back to back
    user agent" with the User Agent, but it is not done correctly,
    because the CSCF must be implemented in all ways as User Agent
    in order to be serve as a B2BUA in this manner.

2. IMS CSCF nodes modify headers in ways explicitly prohibited to
    proxies by the SIP RFCs, again without implementing associated UA
    behavior.

3. IMS CSCF nodes modify bodies in messages which is not permitted to
    proxies by SIP RFCs, again without implementing the associated UA
    behavior.

A number of participants in the SIP working group, including the
chairs authoring this liaison statement, have identified specific
concerns with the IMS Release 5 specifications as we understand
them.  Some of these have been discussed in the context of
SIP or SIPPING chartered work.  We do not propose solutions here,
but we invite consideration of these concerns, with the goal of
3GPP achieving a better alignment to the IETF's SIP RFCs after
discussion in 3GPP and in the SIP and SIPPING mailing lists over some
period.  IETF will provide any support and assistance that will
help.

1) The P-CSCF may send a BYE on behalf of the UA, generally because
    the P-CSCF has been notified by the radio layer that the UA has
    lost contact.  Of course, the P-CSCF doesn't have the credentials
    to provide authentication of the BYE, so many UAs will consider this
    to be a forged message. This also renders 3GPP UAs vulnerable to
    denial of service attacks using forged BYEs.

2) The P-CSCF strips away Route, Record-Route, Via, Path, and
    Service-Route headers before passing messages on to the UA. It
    then reinserts them messages in the other direction,
    and may also strip out Route headers inserted by the UA. This
    breaks end-to-end protection using S/MIME and prevents the UA from
    accessing external services using loose routing. It also prevents
    the UA from knowing about any proxies that may have piggybacked on
    its registration using the Path mechanism, which is a serious
    violation of the openness principle and leaves 3GPP users
    registering with external servers subject to certain
    man-in-the-middle attacks affecting REGISTER messages without any
    way to detect those attacks.

3) The CSCF may edit SDP sent from or to the UA in order to force the
    selection of codecs considered favorable to the operator. This has
    the side effect of breaking end-to-end protection of the SDP using
    S/MIME. It also precludes interoperating with external elements
    when both the IMS UA and the external UA share only a common
    codec not supported by the P-CSCF.

4) The S-CSCF MAY (we believe this is still being discussed in 3GPP)
    obfuscate the To: and From: fields in messages. This appear to be
    based on a particular interpretation of privacy regulation in
    certain European domains.  It has the side effect of breaking
    end-to-end protection with S/MIME and breaking external services
    using the To: and From: fields, such as the most common forms of
    caller-ID used with SIP today.

5) The P-CSCF filters messages from the UA to assure that only an
    identity known to the P-CSCF is presented by the UA. This may
    interact with the preceding characteristic. This appears to be
    required to accommodate the authorization model of 3GPP, which
    authenticates only REGISTER transactions and uses them to establish
    a security association between a UA and the P-CSCF. The side effect is
    that a 3GPP user may use only the operator-provided identity and
    may not be able to effectively use third-party services that
    provide other identities unless those services provide identity
    transformation with a back-to-back user agent.

6) The I-CSCF (or THIG) may encrypt Via and Route information when
    acting in topology-hiding mode. This was allowed for in earlier SIP
    specifications, but the use has been deprecated for a variety of
    reasons. The exact impact on interoperability remains unknown.

7) Some CSCF elements and AS may manipulate message bodies.
    Manipulating message bodies in a proxy is forbidden in RFC 3261
    because it breaks end-to-end protection using S/MIME. These
    elements do not appear to implement all of the UA behavior that
    would enable them to preserve end-to-end protections.

As stated above, this statement does not recommend a timeframe for
aligning on the issues decribed above, but they are important.  One
way to ensure better aligment going forward is in a general 
recommendation.
The SIP Working Group chairs suggest that the implementers of
systems for IMS should consider doing interoperability testing of their
implementations against other SIP implementations. The SIPit
interoperability events are organized explicitly for this purpose,
and we intend to use these events to support the documentation of
interoperability of features required for advancing SIP and related
RFCs from "Proposed Standard" to "Draft Standard" status in the
IETF. Your participation in such testing would be helpful to the whole
SIP community.

i have the same problem as before with this document, i.e., that the
concept of an identity of a user and the user's sip uri are not clear
and not necessarily the same thing.  when a proxy authenticates a user,
for example, using digest authentication, the proxy finds out the user's
identity, but that is not what the proxy places in the p-a-i header.
the header should be called-asserted-uri rather than
p-asserted-identity.

what comes to "hinting", as i have said many times before, i don't like
the term at all.  if the proxy doesn't agree with p-preferred-identity,
the document should say that the proxy SHOULD reject the request.
otherwise the whole thing would be dangerous to the user.

Within 3GPP, there is a requirement for intermediate servers to pass textual information for display to the user. This may be related to a dialog or not.

A typical example may be (in the case of a prepay user):

"Please top up your units or your call may be terminated prematurely".

There are a number of methods that are defined which essentially convey body information between User Agents (INFO, NOTIFY, MESSAGE, PUBLISH?).

Some of these would appear more suitable that others for passing this information. 

Of the existing methods, MESSAGE would appear to be the most suitable (and indeed is the one selected by some of the experts involved). However the internet draft specifically talks about the body being an "Instant Message".

Rather than get into a situation similar to that which affects INFO (i.e. people seem to have implemented various applications on INFO and IETF experts say INFO is not appropriate for that application), could I request an exchange of views on the applicability or not of MESSAGE for this type of information, and if not, what solution would otherwise be suggested.

Note that the information would normally be expected to come from some network based entity (acting as a UA). When related to a dialog, the source may well be some B2BUA between the two end UAs involved in the dialog.

draft-ietf-sip-message-06 states that the body can be of ANY MIME type:
"The body of the request will contain the message to be delivered.
   This body can be of any MIME type, including message/cpim."

With hindsight, I drafted the last paragraph of my original message badly.

Rather than try to paraphrase again, I will select a direct quote from the message draft abstract:

The MESSAGE method is an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  MESSAGE requests
   carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  

My concern is not over how such a body should be coded. The questions is does such a usage to carry "Please top up your units or your call may be terminated prematurely" qualify as an Instant Message, i.e. is it within the semantics of MESSAGE to perform this function.

The introduction part of the draft contains some "hint" about this:
"Instant messaging is defined as the exchange of content between a set
   of participants in near real time.  Generally, the content is short
   text messages, although that need not be the case."

Based on this, my guess is that carrying "Please top up your units or your call may be terminated prematurely" fits to the semantics of the MESSAGE request.

Regards,
Krisztian

Your objections are noted.  Other than your individual objections, we 
have very strong consensus on the draft, so IETF is publishing it.  
You've made a lot of other comments that the WG has agreed with and have 
been incorporated.  The WG just didn't agree with you on that one.

I agree that that is a very good policy to configure in your network and 
its equipment. I would recommend similar policies, but there are other 
folks who want to use different policies to satisfy different 
requirements.

If you want to write an Informational document describing SIP privacy 
policies that benefit the end-user, I will give it agenda time in 
SIPPING. I'd personally like to see such a document published.

thanks,

Hello again,

I just wanted to clarify something.  Despite the subject of *this* 
thread, this liason statement is from the chairs, not from "IETF" as a 
whole.  When I sent this to 3GPP the subject was "Liaison Statement on 
Interoperability Issues and SIP in IMS".

thanks,
-rohan

forgot one more thing:

the preferred-identity (should be preferred-uri) header should not be a
p-header, because it solves a general problem in sip, i.e., sip today
doesn't have a means for an anonymous user to tell which calling party
number it prefers to use when the proxy forwards the request to pstn.

I guess it could be done that way, but you might find that others would prefer some sort of Notification package for this type of thing.

This application seems rather different from the presence type notifications because it seems these notifications are unsolicited. So to me MESSAGE seems like a perfect fit. I don't have to "subscribe" in order to receive instant messages either.

So by saying "Notification package" perhaps you mean a new MIME type specifically for these unsolicited notifications?

Cheers,
Aki

You're not subscribing to get an instant message, you're subscribing to get information about your prepaid units.

Why is it unsolicited?

Is it feasible to have that subscription state hanging around just in case you may some day run out of credit?

Keith:

I have found some hints into the message draft that makes me think this is the appropriate usage of the method. This hints are:

    The MESSAGE method is an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages. 

I guess instant message is a message delivered instantly to the user, and displayed to the user.

    All UAs which support the MESSAGE method MUST be prepared to send and
    receive MESSAGE requests with a body of type text/plain.

Text/plain seems to be textual information that can be displayed to a user.
If it was message/sipfrag, perhaps the information wasn't intended to be
delivered to the user, but text/plain seems to be unformatted information
intended to be readable by a human being.

   Normally, a 200 OK
   response will be generated by the user agent of the request's final
   recipient.  Note that this indicates that the user agent accepted the
   message, not that the user has seen it.

This again suggest that the payload of the MESSAGE method is typically
displayed to the user.

All these hints, make me think that your usage example seems to be a correct
usage of the MESSAGE method.

I believe it is talking about any offers or answers that a given endpoint
generates during the session since either side may re-INVITE. The two side
may use different payload numbers, but each has to use its same original
payload number in all SDP it generates.

Bob - OK, if you read it that way then all is ok.
It wasn't obvious to me that this is what that text
intended, but since it is only an example I guess it
is good enough.

	Thanks,

This seems to me to be an entirely appropriate use of page mode MESSAGE. 
Specifically, I would interpret a message, sent by an automaton, that is 
intended to be rendered for and interpreted by a human being in a timely 
manner, to fall into the category of "instant message."

This, too, is an age old debate: does a proxy have any business
tracking dialogs it does not understand? This has been brought
up repeatedly, and consensus has been consistent throughout the
years: no.

If a proxy knows how a method behaves, it makes perfect sense to
track various related state. For new methods with which the proxy
is unfamiliar, a proxy assigns no semantics. It doesn't know whether
unknown requests have the ability to start, extend, modify, or end
a dialog. New methods may necessarily decide to implement their
own rules about dialog handling to suit whatever purpose the method
is being created for. Can we predict the behavior of all such
methods? Of course not -- otherwise, we'd define them all right now
and not worry about making the protocol extensible. But, to paraphrase
one of Dave Oran's maxims: events are always hard to predict,
especially when they involve the future.

While the principle you advocate is admirable, it cannot be
implemented in such a way that will stand the test of time.

As long as MESSAGE carries content which is intended to be
rendered to the party to whom it is addressed, I assert
that it is serving its intended purpose. The purposes
you describe below meet these criteria compeletely.

Ignoring the other problems with using INFO, it does not
meet your requirement that the information to be conveyed
may not be related to a dialog.

NOTIFY would require definition of event packages for
every sort of information you'd want to convey, which is
probably not what you want. On the other hand, there is
already work ongoing for message waiting indication. For
this sort of notification in particular, it would make
great sense for 3GPP to use SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.

PUBLISH is meant for publication of event package state 
information to an event agent, not general publication
of data. Its use in this context would be gross
misapplication of that method. (If you want a mechanism
for general publication of data, you need to check out
WEBDAV).

I had already responded to Keith's inqury on MESSAGE as raised in the
CN-1 list before I noticed he had also raised it on the SIP list. Here's
my response, just in case anybody cares . . .

The current IETF position is that MESSAGE is appropriate for material
that will be rendered and displayed directly to a human user. It is
considered to be less appropriate, and debatably INappropriate, for
inter-machine communications. Fundamentally, MESSAGE is NOT an RPC
mechanism, it's for talking to people.

Here's an example. Let's say that an application wants to send
unstructured text to a user, informing the user about the state of the
application -- perhaps "It is Tuesday. Call your Mother." MESSAGE is
probably very appropriate for this usage.

On the other hand, assume that a voice mail application wishes to
communicate with a user's phone in such a way that the "you have Voice
Mail" light is illuminated on the phone, if the phone has such a light.
This is a more structured piece of information. It relies on explicit
knowledge of the capabilities of the phone (for example, does it have
the ability to display this sort of notification?) , and is probably not
appropriate for  MESSAGE. In fact, there is ongoing work in SIPPING to
define this specific behavior using an "event package". You can read
about it in Rohan's Message Waiting draft: 

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-mwi-00.txt

Event packages allow the structured content needed for machine
processing to be explicitly defined, making them far more likely to
provide interoperable behavior.

INFO is problematic. The only generally accepted use of INFO currently
in IETF is its use to support mid-call signaling in PSTN interworking
scenarios. This behavior and usage is defined by the SIP-T drafts.
Current thinking is leaning towards either deprecating INFO for other
tasks (define it to have a role only in SIP-T), or to define an "INFO
Package" model so that new usages of INFO can be effectively
standardized. The authors of INFO are leaning towards the SIP-T-only
approach. The IETF does not endorse arbitrary usage of INFO with
proprietary payloads, as such usage is by definition proprietary and not
interoperable.

There have been suggestions made that MESSAGE could be used for carrying
machine-readable structured information if the format and semantic of
the structured information are appropriately specified in an RFC. While
this approach may proceed, it is still under discussion and there is no
firm consensus for this approach at this time.

Guidance to 3GPP, unil further notice: Where the transmitted information
is to be presented to the user and explicit understanding of the
informations's semantic is not required in the phone, use MESSAGE. Where
these conditions are not met, use something else. In many (but not all)
cases, an event package will be an appropriate alternatve.

Hi,

I have some input on having event-notification package
for this :

Although it looks like a user may have to subscribe to
"Credit overflow" kind of event all the time, I guess
this is going to be only during the calls.

This one case may be solved by "MESSAGE". However, is it the
only case? I believe there could be more. The commonality
is that all of them are going to be from the network (not the
peer) and are asynchrounous. For this why not have an event
pacakge under the framework of RFC3265. A UA may subscribe
to network of all network events, and any such event would
trigger the appropriate event notification.

If all the events are for human interaction then "Message"
looks fine. Is there any event where user interaction is
taken over by automatic actions by s/w config? (e.g. in this
case automatic credit upgrade just enough to avoid premature
call termination!)

The question remains : Is there one network element to which
a UA may have to subscribe or many?

thanks,
= Kedar =

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; This application seems rather different from the presence </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; type notifications because it seems these notifications are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; unsolicited. So to me MESSAGE seems like a perfect fit. I </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't have to &quot;subscribe&quot; in order to receive instant </FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; So by saying &quot;Notification package&quot; perhaps you mean a new </FONT>

I understand the intention behind what you are proposing.

The ability to have these kind of things be interpretable
by atomata would certainly be useful; however, the proposal
that we define some unified "network notification" event
package is a bit unworkable. Doing so would first require
standardization of all of the information that the network
would want to convey so that you can define a machine-readable
format for each. To do so requires standardizing all of the
network-provided services, which is something we have
strenuously avoided doing. We instead provide tools that can
be combined to provide services, since such an approach is
far more powerful.

I propose that we hold the course: when we identify information
that is commonly communicated and warrants interpretation by
atomata (such as a message waiting indication), we can define
an event package for it. However, if service designers want to
communicate information from the network to the terminal, they
should feel free to use MESSAGE to do so.

Hi, 
I have some input on having event-notification package 
for this : 
Although it looks like a user may have to subscribe to 
"Credit overflow" kind of event all the time, I guess 
this is going to be only during the calls. 
This one case may be solved by "MESSAGE". However, is it the 
only case? I believe there could be more. The commonality 
is that all of them are going to be from the network (not the 
peer) and are asynchrounous. For this why not have an event 
pacakge under the framework of RFC3265. A UA may subscribe 
to network of all network events, and any such event would 
trigger the appropriate event notification. 
If all the events are for human interaction then "Message" 
looks fine. Is there any event where user interaction is 
taken over by automatic actions by s/w config? (e.g. in this 
case automatic credit upgrade just enough to avoid premature 
call termination!) 
The question remains : Is there one network element to which 
a UA may have to subscribe or many? 
thanks, 
= Kedar =

Hmmm...

I think the problem lies in the presentation to the user.  What Keith is 
describing is a message about a specific call, so it really should be 
sent in the context of that dialog.  (Otherwise, it might arrive with a 
whole pile of SMS messages). Unfortunately, the dialog identifiers and 
cseqs are being managed by the user agents, so the "system" really can't 
just send a MESSAGE mid-dialog unless it is a B2BUA managing the cseqs, 
dialog identifiers, and security associations for that user.   If you 
want this message to be handled differently than other messages, it 
needs to be different.

thanks,
-rohan

is it? what if I have 2 phones using the same pool of credits.  do you=20=

want a notification that you are running out of credits on both phones=20=

or just the one?

<excerpt><smaller>Hi,</smaller>


<smaller>I have some input on having event-notification package

for this :</smaller>


<smaller>Although it looks like a user may have to subscribe to

"Credit overflow" kind of event all the time, I guess

this is going to be only during the calls.</smaller>

</excerpt>is it? what if I have 2 phones using the same pool of
credits.  do you want a notification that you are running out of
credits on both phones or just the one?


thanks,

-rohan


<excerpt><smaller>This one case may be solved by "MESSAGE". However,
is it the

only case? I believe there could be more. The commonality

is that all of them are going to be from the network (not the

peer) and are asynchrounous. For this why not have an event

pacakge under the framework of RFC3265. A UA may subscribe

to network of all network events, and any such event would

trigger the appropriate event notification.</smaller>


<smaller>If all the events are for human interaction then "Message"

looks fine. Is there any event where user interaction is

taken over by automatic actions by s/w config? (e.g. in this

case automatic credit upgrade just enough to avoid premature

call termination!)</smaller>


<smaller>The question remains : Is there one network element to which

a UA may have to subscribe or many?</smaller>

How useful can this be when I'm talking on the phone and I get an Instant Message with text telling me that I'm running out of credit? How often do you stop talking on the phone just to read your SMS? The most likely scenario is that your phone call will be cut short, then you go and read your IM and only then you find out what the contents of the IM were.

I think this type of information should be conveyed by a special tone that the phone plays or by a light going red of the phone. Perhaps implementation specific. The point is that we can't standardise that "your running out of credit" type of IM MUST be rendered to the user.

Having said that, I agree that MESSAGE is the choice if contents of a request are to be rendered to a user. But if I, as a phone manufacturer want my phone to flash a red light when suck IM is received, then I can't.

At least my phone gives me an audible indication that a message has arrived. Especially while I'm using a hands-free set, I often read SMSs *while* I'm talking.

> The most likely scenario is that your

Same as a user ignoring an in-band notification of low credit.

Again, the phone can give you an audible tone when a message arrives. If its urgent, maybe the tone is a little louder...

Are you saying that a phone should have a red light for indicating low credit? If that same red light is used for anything else, you will anyway need to stop talking to determine exactly why it's blinking this time.

Perhaps this sort of functionality could be implemented using the Explode-Your-Phone header? ;-D

Cheers,
Aki

Hmm. My phone plays a tone and turns on an indicator whenever it gets 
SMS. I think this is just a matter of phone user interface design.

Question with regard to RFC 3261, Call-ID and Authorization.
Suppose I send an Request (Invite) with a specific Call-ID and that=20
Request is rejected with a 401/407 requiring authentication (user to =

the Call-ID be the same Call-ID as in the original request? There are

Am I missing something here?

I thought the RFC3261 SHOULD have assigned a different SIP version number...
that's what a version number is meant for!

To summarize what I understand so far from the responses.

1)	Where the information is not semantically understood by the UA, but is simply rendered to the user, then MESSAGE method is appropriate. (This is the old ISDN definition of stimulus.) Where it is sent in the context of an existing dialog by an intermediate entity between the two endpoints, that intermediate entity would have to be a B2BUA. The current 3GPP requirements we are trying to address is this one.

2)	Where the information is to be semantically understood by the UA, before it is rendered to the user (e.g. to light an appropriate lamp, or flash an appropriate ikon on a display) then an Event package with the information carried in NOTIFY would be appropriate. (This is the old ISDN definition of functional.) This would require prior UA subscription to the package, which in my opinion is not unreasonable, as the terminal subscribes to packages that match its display or other characteristics.

3)	Nobody is proposing that these methods do not support this capability, or suggesting we need to go away and work on new methods (via SIPPING then SIP).

Thanks for your assistance.

Keith

Adam has made many good points in response to this, and I generally 
agree with what he is saying. Some more comments inline.

Oh? It should not. We removed REGISTER refreshes as a way to keep NAT 
bindings alive from the most recent draft-ietf-sip-nat.

The current draft in the repository allows for UPDATE, which is 
"lighter" than INVITE. It also allows for the UPDATE to be used without 
SDP, so there is no new offer/answer exchange. I don't think you can ask 
for much ligher than that.

Originally, the UAC was the refresher, period.

However, subsequent discussions on the list indicated that people wanted 
a model whereby session timer could work so long as only one side 
supported the extension. This would facilitate its introduction. That 
means that either UAC or UAS could be the refresher. Once you do that, 
you need an explicit way to determine and indicate who it is. I don't 
know of a simpler way to do this given the constraints that it should 
work so long as one of the two UA support it.

Another design goal was to allow proxies to set the timer. Indeed, the 
primary point of the extension is for proxies to get refreshes on their 
call state, so they can know when to expire it. Just like other 
soft-state methods - such as REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE - the refresh 
intervals need to be negotiated. Otherwise, you get locked into an 
interval that you may find is useless, and you cannot ever change it 
since its burned into the spec. Now, once you add negotiation, the user 
to user nature of the timer introduces the DoS problems that need to be 
addressed.

This doesn't make sense to me. The origin field in the SDP will indicate 
whether it has changed. Thus, it is easy to determine whether this is a 
refresh or modification. Furthermore, if you use UPDATE, there need not 
even be SDP.

I think Adam has addressed this point, so there is no need for me to

It seems that you are getting simplification from two changes - proxies 
cannot request the timer, and the timer value cannot be negotiated. 
These are two important features of the specification as it stands today.

Again, one of the design goals is for proxies to request session timer, 
since they are the primary consumers of the timer. A UA has other means 
at its disposal to determine that a session has terminated (RTCP 
heartbeats, for example). So, a session timer whereby the proxies cant 
request it, is broken.

Similar point about negotiation of the value.

IMHO, idempotency of INVITE requires that whatever procedure is done for 
INVITE, also be the one that is implied for re-INVITE.

Section 8.1.3.5 spells this out explicitly:

  In all of the above cases, the request is retried by creating a new
    request with the appropriate modifications.  This new request
    constitutes a new transaction and SHOULD have the same value of the
    Call-ID, To, and From of the previous request, but the CSeq should
    contain a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous.

Absolutely not.

As Adam and Robert have pointed out, you cannot infer anything from the 
via cookie except that the branch ID is a transaction ID. 
Implementations aren't binary in terms of their support for 3261. Some 
support some of the features, others more, and others, all. Such mixed 
implementations are a reality, and that is why we choose to support 
backwards compatibility on a feature-by-feature basis rather than 
glomming it all into a new version of SIP.

Well, I think I disagree with Robert on this one.

I would like Max-Forwards treatment at a server to be generic to all 
servers - proxies and UAS alike. If a proxy rejects a request with 
Max-Forwards: 0, so too should a UAS. However, the point is really one 
of philosophy; I can find no specific problem with a UAS ignoring 
Max-Forwards.

An interesting point of comparison, however, is the TTL header in the IP 
packet. Do hosts look at this field or not? I suspect they don't, which 
would probably support Robert's position....

Time for my normal "sip error handling" speech...

The spec does not dictate the error treatment for unrecoverable errors 
caused by misimplemented clients and servers. It would be futile. In 
these cases, an implementation is encouraged to be as forgiving as 
possible. In this case, either discarding the message, or a 4xx without 
a call-id header, would be reasonable choices.

Please don't read 21.4.1 so literally that it implies that you are 
supposed to generate a 4xx to a request without an invite. Its merely 
providing some general guidance on usage of the reason phrase. However, 
I will make a note to change the example for draft standard.

Old mail, but I want to make sure we capture any possible bugs in the 
spec. Responses inline:

I'm confused. In my version of the spec, it does in fact read properly:

When a UAC sends a request containing an S/MIME body that initiates a
    dialog, or sends a non-INVITE request outside the context of a
    dialog, the UAC SHOULD structure the body as an S/MIME
    'multipart/signed' CMS SignedData body.  If the desired CMS service
    is EnvelopedData (and the public key of the target user is known),
    the UAC SHOULD send the EnvelopedData message encapsulated within a
    SignedData message.

Are you sure you are looking at 3261, and not bis-09? This was an error 
in older versions of the draft, but it was caught.

I think "its capabilities" is correct. Its referring to the capabilities 
of one of the target URI. I fixed it.

There is no need to actually do any format conversions to rfc 2533 
syntax, no. Whats important is that the rule matching procedures of 
rfc2533 are used. The easiest way to do that is to specify that the 
behavior of your implementation has to be as if it had done the 
conversion, and then ran rfc2533.

I'll clarify that.

Thanks for the comments Mr. Rosenberg.  Since this particular case is also a
part of the torture test cases (2.11), I was really stumped on this.

But it does! The new version number is 2.0z9hG4bK

(where z9hG4bK is the branch magic cookie :-)

Hello to everybody,
I need some help.
Does anyone know which is the behaviour of CSCF (P-CSCF, I-CSCF and S-CSCF) 
of 3GPP IMS when these entities try to process an unknown header (e.g. a 
proprietary header specified by a company) ?
Do they threat such messages just ignoring the header and proceeding in the 
standard way?

Thank you in advance,

Peter

This would properly be a question for 3GPP, not IETF.

SIP proxies compliant to RFC 3261 will pass the unknown header along
unmodified.

Whether or not the 3GPP x-CSCFs will be RFC3261 compliant proxies or
some kind of user agent will be determined by 3GPP. 

My initial guess at a response might be "it depends -- which x-CSCF are
you talking about, and in which operator's network?"

Let me add one more point to Adam's.

There does exist a common means by which the user can express
willingness to receive instant messages about different types
of events. This mechanism is in widespread use for email today.
Its called "the web". One would go to a web page for stock quotes,
say, and sign up by giving your SIP URL. You would then pick
which stocks you like, and it would send an IM when they go
up or down by too much.

Since the information in the IM is itself for consumption
by a human, not an automata, the process by which the
information can be requested can also be done by human,
through the web.

I concur on all points below. I just want to add a few sentences of 
motivation, inline:

Right.

Exactly. It makes no sense to send information to an automata unless you 
know it can process it, and is ready and interested in receiving it. A 
package provides all of that, and allows you to negotiate the types, for 
example.

For a message meant for a human, you can be more flexible. Even if they 
device can't render the type, the human is smart enough to do something 
about it - download a new renderer, or forward it to their email 
account, or ask someone for help, or whatever. Humans are also better at 
understanding whether a message that is receivd late (because it was 
stored in a message store as the user was offline when it was sent) is 
still useful or not. An automata cannot easily make this judgement, and 
so storage of things like notifications to an automata (for message 
waiting, for example), make less sense to me.

Bob's interpretation is correct. It means that each sid maintains its 
own mapping of payload type numbers to codecs, and that mapping applies 
to any offers and answers sent within the dialog by that UA.

Usage of the same payload type numbers for the same codec in each 
direction (ie. using PT 100 for g.723 from A to B and from B to A) is 
SHOULD strength, I believe. We allowed them to be asymmetric primarily 
to support H.323 interop.

Version 02 of draft-ietf-sip-nat was posted two months ago (5Jul02) in
response to earlier suggestions and there seem to have been no further
comments.

I am therefore requesting working group last call of the sip-nat draft.
According to our posted milestones, this should have concluded last call
last week, so we're not doing too badly. I'd like to send it on to the
IESG by 20Sep, so get your comments in posthaste.

The draft in question is available at:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-nat-02.txt

As usual, please post dicussion to the list and copy the lead author,
jdrosen@dynamicsoft.com

Thanks,

--
Dean

Hi ,

     could somebody please point to the draft or RFC which contains the
information about how the 
     CDR ( call detail records ) are generated for the SIP calls ( what all
informaion should be there 
     in the CDR ) from the Media Gateway Controller Perspective . 

     Is there any document available for this ...If yes please let me know
....

Thanks and Regards,
jitender .

Depending on whose storyline you read 3GPP CSCFs are either proxies, or B2BUAs, or some horrible and illegal mismash of both. Different types of CSCFs fall into different categories. 

As Dean says, proxies relay unknown headers from one side to the other.

RFC 3261 does not define the transfer characteristics of B2BUAs. While UASs are required to ignore unrecognized headers received in requests, this appears to be specified such that the request gets processed by the UAS despite the header. It would therefore appear to be legal to pass the unrecognized header to the B2B UAC for transmission at the outgoing side. For responses I guess similar arguments would apply.

So in summary, those 3GPP entities that behave as proxies will pass on; those 3GPP entities that behave as B2BUAs may (and in practice probably will); those that are argued to be neither one or the other will do one or the other.

Note that the sipchanges draft says that there is no such thing as a company defined proprietary header. All proprietary headers are defined in internet drafts --> informational RFCs. Therefore by a stroke of publication they will all cease to exist!

I have been absent from this list for awhile, and just caught this
message... I agree with the following paragraphs, 

"In the case where there is a NAT between the client and server, in
   order for the response to always be received, the NAT binding must
   remain in existence for the duration of the transaction. Most UDP NAT
   bindings appear to have a timeout of about one minute. Therefore,
   non-INVITE transactions will have no problem. For INVITE
   transactions, the client may need to retransmit its INVITE every 20
   seconds or so, even after receiving a provisional response, in order
   to keep the binding open to receive the final response.


        OPEN ISSUE: This is awful. Perhaps a further sign that the
        only real answer is TCP? Or, perhaps this belongs in
        sipping-nat-scenarios, not here.
"

From my brief reading of the draft it appears that only SIP rport is
being requested...  how is this useful to sdp negotiation...is it merely
for such items as IM?

I think that this would be useful, and possibly not require the multiple
invites mentioned, if the rport were used in the sdp as well... then the
media could maintain the open connections.

Since I am shooting very quickly from the hip with jsut a five minute
speed read of the draft let me know if this is way off or if I am going
in the right direction and reasoning and I will put more of my thoughts
on this in a form that can be useful for use within this draft. (With a
lot more effort  :^)    )

I will try to read more this weekend and offer more input as well.

Its only for SIP. In fact, its only for getting responses back when the 
request is sent through a NAT; handling registrations through a NAT is 
also not addressed here. Dealing with NAT for media signaled through SDP 
is a different problem as well.

Huh?

Media isn't sent to the proxy. To deal with media, you need something 
like STUN or SPAN/TURN.

Although it has expired, here is one draft you may find interesting:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schulzrinne-sipping-radius-account
ing-00.txt

There has been some discussion of whether RADIUS is the appropriate protocol
to use. The general consensus is that it is not ideal, but it is what some
providers have installed. However, I do not know what other drafts may be
available describing CDR generation.

Good luck,
Rick

See ipdr.org for another approach. (We also have a DIAMETER version for 
accounting: draft-narayanan-sipping-aaa-diameter-00.txt.) Comments on 
both would be most welcome. Unfortunately, while there are plenty of 
public-domain and commercial RADIUS servers, the number of DIAMETER 
servers seems to be approximately one.

One long term view on AAA and CDRs for voice services is that all AAA
transactions and payments should fit in the emerging Web services for
any type of service or merchandise. 

Internal systems for authentication, billing, traffic measurments, etc.
may need to be outsourced or resold, just like any other service. Having
only VoIP using specific (or even obscure ones like DIAMETER) platforms
does not seem a very good proposition for service providers, where
streaminling IT is a perenial objective.

Here is some good reading material:

If the system can not complete a phone call in less than one minute, the
caller will have hung up long ago.  When you dial a call today, how long
will you wait for the called party?  In most parts of the world, about 10
seconds is  the limit and then the caller hangs up and tries again.

This is one of the reasons that I am wodering why we need this
functionality. My comment earlier, that Johnathan responded to, was in
relation to a client to client communication (though I didnt explain it
clearly and the response was appropriate to my answer).  

In a situation such as this, client to client, a mechanism to keep a
translation open I thought it might be useful.  But if this is merely to
keep a sip session open during sip session establishment, I havent seen
a need for this as all sip traffic going through NAT that I have seen
hasnt had an issue with timeouts.  On the other hand registrations may
be a good reason to do this, but is already addressed at this point by
many clients that now offer a nat feature that permits a more permanent
feature to maintain constant ports per client for this purpose.... so
why do this at all?

Which functionality? Your original note was talking about SDP, which is 
not what the sip-nat draft is about. Or, are you questioning the need 
for sip-nat at all?

SIP-NAT is not about keeping translations open. sip-nat is about making 
sure responses are received properly for any request sent through a NAT. 
If you want to keep a binding active to receive media traffic, you use 
STUN.

Your comment makes no sense to me without defining "this".

I cannot understand this sentence since I do not know what a "nat 
feature that permits a more permanent feature" is, nor do I know what 
"this" is.

Please, before complaining about this specification, kindly spell out 
exactly what your complaints are.

Great, and that case works.

However, we have sevearl other cases of concern. The most irritating of 
these is the case where a UAS is a gateway that connects to an 800 
number system that actually never generates an ACM. Rather, it uses the 
reverse media path to prompt the user that they are in a queue. Once the 
user is out of the queue, the call is actually answered. As a result of 
this, the call can "ring" for minutes, perhaps even hours. To keep the 
binding alive to receive the SIP response is this case, the client will 
need to retransmit the INVITE every 30s or so. Of course, TCP is better 
here, and won't require any retransmits. The provisional response sent 
by the UAS, in order to keep timer C going, will maintain the bindings.

However, the main feature provided by this specification, rport, ensures 
that the response, whether generated immediately or later on, is 
received by the UAC behind the NAT.

records described in the RFC. Are there servers that I can query. Is dig =
the
appropriate program, or am I way off base. If so, can someone push me at
least in the right direction.

Yes that was off topic and out of place.... :^) I was thinking of my
current focus which is traversal/enablement.... not part of this thread.

And yes, the question is why sip-nat...

By having the ability of ensuring that sip is recieved properly I am
assuming that the intention is that of maintaining a nat binding for sip
to be contacted through. I am not referring to media traffic.. you
clarified the intent in your first email. I am now questioning why
sip-nat? Not to be argumentative, merely to understand the intent.

Hi Chris,

We have sufficient interest and consensus to proceed with this 
(chartered) document, even if you think it will not be useful to you 
personally.  If you want further explanations about why 
draft-ietf-sip-nat is useful, please take that discussion off the list. 
If there are other SIP and NAT related topics you would like to see 
addressed that are not discussed in draft-ietf-sipping-nat-
scenarios-00.txt, then you are free to propose this as new work in 
SIPPING.

thanks,
-rohan

No, that is not correct.

The normal behavior for sending a response to a SIP request is to send 
it to the source IP address of the request, but to the port in the Via 
header. This rule will cause responses to be lost through all NAT types, 
even if the bindings last forever. sip-nat allows for the response to 
actually be received.

Thanks Johnathan, thats what I was looking for, and it makes perfect sense
now. (I was premature earlier...)

The usage of NAPTR records is very new, and was added close to the end 
of the standardization process of rfc's 3261-5. Thus, I suspect there 
are not that many deployments or DNS servers you can query for these 
records. However, I believe there are increasing numbers of 
implementations.

Would be nice to test some of rfc3263 at sipit...

I've got a quick question. Timer C >= 180s. When timer c fires a couple things should happen to expire the transaction or keep it going. How does having a minimum value of 180s allow the provisional responses to keep the binding alive through a NAT if we're talking about NAT expirations ~ 30s? 
 
I just didn't understand the sentence 'The provisional response sent
by the UAS, in order to keep timer C going, will maintain the bindings.'

	Great, and that case works.
	
	However, we have sevearl other cases of concern. The most irritating of
	these is the case where a UAS is a gateway that connects to an 800
	number system that actually never generates an ACM. Rather, it uses the
	reverse media path to prompt the user that they are in a queue. Once the
	user is out of the queue, the call is actually answered. As a result of
	this, the call can "ring" for minutes, perhaps even hours. To keep the
	binding alive to receive the SIP response is this case, the client will
	need to retransmit the INVITE every 30s or so. Of course, TCP is better
	here, and won't require any retransmits. The provisional response sent
	by the UAS, in order to keep timer C going, will maintain the bindings.
	
	However, the main feature provided by this specification, rport, ensures
	that the response, whether generated immediately or later on, is
	received by the UAC behind the NAT.

All,

In RFC3261 23.2 it states:

"Whenever the CMS SignedData message is used in S/MIME for SIP, it MUST
contain the certificate bearing the public key necessary to verify the
signature."

I assume that "it" refers to the CMS SignedData message.

An alternative would presumably be for the certificate to be contained in a
separate MIME part of type application/pks7-mime with
smime-type="certs-only". This would have the advantage that the certificate,
which does not change often, and which I understand can be fairly large,
could make use of content indirection.

If the certificate is required to be embedded in the same SignedData object
as the signature itself, then I guess this would not be possible.

So, is inclusion of the certificate as a separate body part, prohibited by
the SIP specification ?

Regards...Mark

Uh, unless it's actually a MUST in the S/MIME
spec, there's no reason why the certificate has to
be carried in the message. Certs are public data
and can be fetched from any source, including... a
(x.500) directory. In fact, I believe this would
probably harm interoperability if you wanted to
just use naked public keys since self-signed certs
are much more likely to have agreement problems
than just a naked key.

Hi All,

If SIP does not prohibit what Mark suggests, I think Mark's idea is good. I
like the notion of decoupling to the extent possible.

Subject: [Sip] S/MIME certificates question


All,

In RFC3261 23.2 it states:

"Whenever the CMS SignedData message is used in S/MIME for SIP, it MUST
contain the certificate bearing the public key necessary to verify the
signature."

I assume that "it" refers to the CMS SignedData message.

An alternative would presumably be for the certificate to be contained in a
separate MIME part of type application/pks7-mime with
smime-type="certs-only". This would have the advantage that the certificate,
which does not change often, and which I understand can be fairly large,
could make use of content indirection.

If the certificate is required to be embedded in the same SignedData object
as the signature itself, then I guess this would not be possible.

So, is inclusion of the certificate as a separate body part, prohibited by
the SIP specification ?

Regards...Mark

Mike,

Well, I guess it's a MUST in the SIP spec (section quoted below), if you
assume that the 'it' in that sentence refers to the CMS SignedData message,
and not to the SIP message in which it (err, the CMS SignedData message) is
contained.

This does make a great deal of sense. And I think it would be an
excellent
use of content indirection. Could someone clarify the purpose of the
"MUST"
in this text?

Hi All,

If SIP does not prohibit what Mark suggests, I think Mark's idea is
good. I like the notion of decoupling to the extent possible.

Subject: [Sip] S/MIME certificates question


All,

In RFC3261 23.2 it states:

"Whenever the CMS SignedData message is used in S/MIME for SIP, it MUST
contain the certificate bearing the public key necessary to verify the
signature."

I assume that "it" refers to the CMS SignedData message.

An alternative would presumably be for the certificate to be contained
in a separate MIME part of type application/pks7-mime with
smime-type="certs-only". This would have the advantage that the
certificate, which does not change often, and which I understand can be
fairly large, could make use of content indirection.

If the certificate is required to be embedded in the same SignedData
object as the signature itself, then I guess this would not be possible.

So, is inclusion of the certificate as a separate body part, prohibited
by the SIP specification ?

Regards...Mark

Hi

Are the SIP timer B, F and T4 necessary with reliable transports (TCP,

Why??


Thanks

Ok, I have put on my asbestos underwear and will take a minor stab at this
one....

It does not need a new version number because a 2543 sip device will
interoperate fine with a 3261 device.

The "z9hG4bK forever" hack does not mean that the device is 3261 compliant.
There are lots of things that do z9hG4bK but don't do loose routing.

Anyway, give 3261 is out, it is probably a mute point.

The current mapping of SIP to Radius accounting that many shipping proxies
and gateways use is pretty bizarre stuff. The whole billing area is
something I think could use some work but it is pretty hard to get good
consensus on it. On one hand there is a good argument that Radius is
woefully inadequate and on the other hand there is the argument that most
deployed systems that are doing minute based billing use Radius.

Please move this thread to sipping and remove sip from any replies.

I guess I can see why you "MUST" include the certificate in the SIP message,
as you have no way of knowing whether the receiver has any other way to get
it. The question is whether it MUST be in the same CMS SignedData structure
as the signature itself, or wherther it could be in another MIME body part,
where it could be indirected.

Note that if you use indirection, you still have no idea whether the
receiver has any way to get the data. But it is a requirement of the
indirection mechanism that it can fall back to in-line carriage of the data,
if the receiver doesn't support indirection or the URI scheme provided. At
least this is what I thought - Sean can correct me if I'm wrong!

the certificate in the SIP message, as you have no way of knowing =

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Note that if you use indirection, you still have no =

   That's only the start of your problems. Even if you
   send a cert, you have no idea whether the other side
   trusts the cert's signing root. Nor without any
   prior contact are you likely to know the other
   side's public key, so you're not likely to be
   able to encrypt the body. Which all makes the
   need for some sort of directory service all the
   more likely, especially since these kinds of 
   considerations cannot be dealt with by the
   signaling alone... 

   Yet another reason why just plopping S/MIME in
   as a replacement for PGP didn't actually do
   much to solve real life problems. Yes, yes, I
   know... dead horse. I'll shut up now.

I wanted to know if there's any tool or SIP UA implementation available
which I could use for testing scenarios involving INFO.

Any information would be of great help.

Thanks

Our intention was not to rule out things like content indirection, although
at the time we didn't understand SIP-based content indirection well enough
to make special allowances for it. The MUST is present, as Mark conjectures,
in order to ensure that the cert will be available to the destination, not
to dictate any particular manner in which it must be made available. I think
the use of content indirection meets the spirit, if not exactly the letter,
of the passage quoted below.

   If there are other ways to obtain the certificate -- 
   assuming that there's a certificate at all -- then
   forcing it to be sent through SIP is quite wasteful.
   In fact, the device itself may not even know what 
   certificates are associated with its public key.

   And this, of course, doesn't even begin to address
   the larger issue of not knowing what certs roots
   and namespaces are in common between the two UA's.
   My browser, for example, knows about the roots of
   about 3 dozen CA's; there's no guarantee that the
   cert under the root the UAC chooses will have any
   relevance to the UAS; it's pretty much the same
   shot in the dark as not sending any cert at
   all. As in, the likelihood of interoperablity
   on almost any scale beyond "lab" is extremely
   low as currently specified.

This is more a SIPPING issue than a SIP issue... but yes, I was hoping that
my proposal for a calling party's category tel URL parameter cover this (it
speaks to the fact that in North American networks, the OLI is often the
repository for information that appears in the CPC elsewhere). The draft
happens to be expired at the moment, though I will be resubmitting it fairly
soon.

If there is agreement about the interpretation of this 'MUST', along the
lines that Jon suggests below, is there any way we can clarify this in a
specification ? For example by providing an example somewhere in which the
cert is in a separate MIME body & not in the CMS SignedData ? Perhaps in the
eventual Content Indirection specification ?

[It seems there is some discussion about whether the MUST should be there
*at all*, which is a separate issue. My suggestion above is based on the
fact that it IS there in RFC3261 & we should clarify how it should be
(re)interpreted.]

I'll log this in bugzilla for clarification.

Folks -

For some time, we've been using bugzilla to track open-issues and
document errors for rfc2542bis/rfc3261 and a few other documents.
It has proven to be an extremely effective tool for the document
editors.

We think it will make a good reference tool for the working group
as a whole, so we're making it generally available for query and
browsing. You won't be able to enter bugs or comments unless you
are the editor for the document that's being tracked - we need to
keep the discussion on this mailing list. You will be able to search
for open issues (all bugs representing an open issue are tagged with
the keyword "OPEN-ISSUE"), and track the resolution of reported
errors.

The interface is at http://www.sipwg.org

It has lots of online help, but if you need more, see
http://www.bugzilla.org/

Enjoy!
RjS

According to 17.1.1.2:

  For
    any transport, the client transaction MUST start timer B with a value
    of 64*T1 seconds (Timer B controls transaction timeouts).

So, yes.

Yes.



  and T4 necessary with reliable transports (TCP,
> SCTP)???

T4 is not a timer, its a constant. Timer K is set to zero for reliable 
transports, T4 for unreliable.

B and F still need to be set, because even though a TCP connection is up 
to the downstream element, it doesn't mean it is sufficiently alive to 
generate a response.

My comment below refers to the TCP case. TCP bindings expire too if 
there is no TCP keepalive or traffic on the connection. That expiration 
is usually many minutes, 10-30 it seems. So, a message every 3m will 
keep it alive if the TCP keepalive isn't doing so.

Hello,

RFC 3261 says, in session 14.2 

"Section 13.3.1 describes the procedure for distinguishing incoming re-INVITEs from incoming initial INVITEs "

but all I can read in section 13.3.1 on that topic is

"If the request is a mid-dialog request, the method-independent processing described in Section 12.2.2 is first applied."

Now I wonder if there is a way to statelessly distinguish a INVITE from a re-INVITE ?

Any answer appreciated,

Alexis Nikichine

Hi,

INVITE will not have to Tag. re-INVITE MUST have the to tag. 

This applies if UA's are RFC 3261 compliant, not the old ones.

Thx
Samir

Hi Folks,

I wanted to give everyone a quick heads up on the MESSAGE draft.

In response to IESG requested changes, Ben just submitted version -07 of 
draft-ietf-sip-message. In general, the IESG response to the draft was 
very good. Most of the requested changes were very minor. The only real 
significant change, was to make implementation of SMIME a MUST to allow 
folks to have end-to-end protection of their messages.  Note that this 
does not require folks to always *use* SMIME, just that it needs to be 
available in implementations.  This is following a general policy of the 
the Security Area (with the blessing of the IESG and IAB) that newly 
standardized protocols, or newly standardized usages of protocols, need 
end-to-end security. I'm sure the IESG will require the same thing of 
the Jabber community for XMPP as they did for us, and as they required 
of the BEEP community for APEX.

Now before anyone complains, I would like to remind you all that it is 
extremely unlikely that we could get MESSAGE approved without some 
end-to-end security mechanism. Feel free to bring the issue up on the 
saag list or in Atlanta if you feel strongly that the Security Area is 
out of line.

Once the new draft appears in the archives, I expect that the IESG will 
approve MESSAGE shortly.

thanks,
-rohan

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


	Title		: The source and sink attributes for the Session 
                          Description Protocol
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo, H. Schulzrinne, E. Burger
	Filename	: draft-camarillo-mmusic-source-sink-00.txt
	Pages		: 7
	Date		: 2002-9-13
	
This document defines two media level SDP attributes, namely source
and sink. They are intended to be used to invoke services that
involve media manipulation, such as transcoding services.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Internet Media Type message/sipfrag
	Author(s)	: R. Sparks
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-sipfrag-00.txt
	Pages		: 9
	Date		: 2002-9-13
	
This document registers the message/sipfrag MIME media type.  This
type is similar to message/sip , but allows certain subsets of well
formed SIP messages to be represented instead of requiring a complete
SIP message.  In addition to end-to-end security uses, message/
sipfrag is used with the REFER method to convey information about the
status of a referenced request

This draft replaces draft-sparks-sip-mimetypes-03, and incorporates 
review comments from the IESG.

The syntax has not changed. The draft now contains examples of sipfrag
mime parts and discussion of their use. In particular, the security
section has been fleshed out and now requires extensions that use REFER
to explicitly discuss certain attacks. 

This is ready for approval. However, enough words changed during this
review phase that its appropriate for the working group to give it a
quick inspection before moving forward. Please look it over and comment
quickly. This draft is holding up a train of others.

Thank you for your comments.

My comments are inline.

Your are right. When the I-D is updated they will be two documents 
(requirements, and proposal).

Since I am kind of new comer in SIP community, I am not sure which 
WG should handle these problem.

I think major differece between "language tag" and my proposal is 
ease of ignorance. The inline language tag is hard to separate the 
language tagging and other parts.

I cannot provide enough evidence about this statement, but here is 
the 3rd party article which described why "language tag" is 
discourged in most cases.

http://xml.coverpages.org/languageIdentifiers.html#unicode

I hope SIP-WG will also pay attension to my proposal.

The URL for my I-D is:

Best.

Hi,

A couple of questions related to TEL-URL use in SIP:


Q1.

When SIP-URI is used, if we include any uri-parameters we MUST put
brackets around the uri.

example:

To: <sip:12345;user=ip>

Also, I assume that the same applies for TEL-URL, ie if any tel-url
parameters are present brackets must also be used.

example:

To: <tel:12345;param=value>

Now, the TEL-URL also defines "isdn-subaddress" and "phone-context".
They are not defined as parameters, but as optional parts of the number
itself, even if they "look" like parameters from a SIP point of view
(since they are separated by ";"), so I would like to clarify if
brackets still must be used with those (otherwise the SIP parser will
treat them as header parameters), even if they are not defined as uri
parameters.

example:

To: <tel:12345;phone-context=123>

...instead of...

To: tel:12345;phone-context=123


Q2:

Which of the SIP-URI parameters (transport, ttl, user, method and maddr)
are valid also for TEL-URL? They are allowed from a ABNF point of view
(as tel url parameters), but I would like to clarify if they (or, at
least parts of them) shall be treated in the same way as if they are
received in a SIP-URL.

Christer Holmberg

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Session Initiation Protocol Extension for Instant 
                          Messaging
	Author(s)	: B. Campbell, J. Rosenberg
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-message-07.txt
	Pages		: 22
	Date		: 2002-9-16
	
Instant Messageing (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between
users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not
required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode,
that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for
participants to maintain an interactive conversation.
The MESSAGE method is an extension to the Session Initation Protocol
(SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  MESSAGE requests
carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests
do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each
Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE
requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some
other SIP request.
Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP it inherits all the
request routing and security features of that protocol.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-message-07.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-message-07.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-message-07.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

Hello,

draft-ietf-sip-events does not specify how a server should handle an
UNSUBSCRIBE request that
is received before the SUBSCRIBE process was completed.


In other words, If the server receives a SUBSCRIBE request and before it
responds with a final response
an UNSUBSCRIBE is received for the same dialog. 

Should the server reject the UNSUBSCRIBE?


Regards,
Sarit Galanos.

| In other words, If the server receives a SUBSCRIBE request

| an UNSUBSCRIBE is received for the same dialog. 

RFC 3265 does not expect provisional response for SUBSCRIBE, so before the
notifier responds with a final response, there is no dialog created yet and
no unSUBSCRIBE can possibly be received for the same dialog.

According to RFC 3261, 20.20.

"... the "name-addr" form MUST be used if the "addr-spec" contains
 a comma, question mark, or semicolon."

That says to me if the "isdn-subaddress" and "phone-context"
are part of the URL then the "name-addr" form MUST be used.

Don't know the answer for Q2.

Please take a look at 19.1.6 of RFC 3261. It describes how tel URIs are 
mapped into SIP URIs. Note that the tel URI parameters appear in the 
user part of the SIP URL.

Hi Jonathan,

> user part of the SIP URL.

My issue is more related to how SIP-URI parameters are mapped into TEL-URI
parameters, and if SIP-URI parameters can be used also in TEL-URIs.

The only SIP-URI parameter 19.1.6 mentions is the user parameter, ie when a
TEL-URI parameter is mapped into a SIP-URI then user=phone.

But, what about the ttl-, method-, lr- and maddr parameters? How shall they be
handled if received within a TEL-URL? I guess some of those can't be used, and
can simply be ignored, but there may be some that should be treated the same
way as if received within a SIP-URI. Or?

Regards,

Christer Holmberg

Hello
       I have doubt regarding the following  statement of the
draft-ietf-sip-update-02.txt

"A UAS that receives an UPDATE before it has generated a final
response to a previous UPDATE or INVITE on the same dialog
 MUST return a 500 response to the new UPDATE, and MUST
include a Retry-After field with a Retry-After header field with a
randomly chosen  value between 0 and 10 seconds."

From my understanding, the UPDATE method allows the caller or
callee to provide updated session information before a final response
to the initial INVITE request is generated. So, why need to send the 500
 response to UPDATE request where the UAS has not generated a final
response to a previous  INVITE  on the same dialog.

I think the statement should be
"A UAS that receives an UPDATE before it has generated a final
response to a previous UPDATE or re-INVITE on the same dialog
 MUST return a 500 response to the new UPDATE, and MUST
include a Retry-After field with a Retry-After header field with a
randomly chosen  value between 0 and 10 seconds."

Please correct me if I am wrong.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Compressing the Session Initiation Protocol
	Author(s)	: G. Camarillo
	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-compression-01.txt
	Pages		: 12
	Date		: 2002-9-17
	
This document describes a mechanism to signal that compression is
desired for one or more SIP messages. It also states when it is
appropriate to send compressed SIP messages to a SIP entity.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-compression-01.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to 
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
	"get draft-ietf-sip-compression-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
	mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
	"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-compression-01.txt".
	
NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
		
		
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.

I'd say any TEL URL params should be treated within the context of TEL URL
only. Since RFC2806 does not define ttl, method, maddr or lr params, they
should be treated as future-extension params and, hence, given no special
meaning. In other words, tel:12345;transport=TCP does not imply the use of
TCP. 

Thank you,
Igor Slepchin

Hi,

> I'd say any TEL URL params should be treated within the context of TEL URL
> only. Since RFC2806 does not define ttl, method, maddr or lr params, they
> should be treated as future-extension params and, hence, given no special

I guess one issue with that solution is that in the future parameters with the
same names may be defined also for Tel-Url, but they may have a completely
separate function from the Sip-Uri parameter with the same name. So, by simply
moving the parameters from one Uri to anther could problems, or at least
unwanted behaviour.

The other solution would of course to discard the Sip-Uri parameters, when the
Sip-to-Tel mapping... Would that cause any problems?

Hi,
This is regarding branches in CANCEL & INVITE.

Section 9.1 of RFC says

"9.1 Client Behavior
...
The CANCEL request MUST NOT contain any Require or Proxy-Require header 
fields."


Consider the following scenario
UAC sends INVITE to P1.
P1 forwards it statlessley to UAS.
UAC sends CANCEL to P1 (to cancel the INVITE).
P1 forwards CANCEL also to UAS.

Let INVITE request have Proxy-Require header.

While handling INVITE at proxy,
P1 calculates the VIA's loop-detection part using the Proxy-Require header.
(The unique part would be calculated using a combinatronic function.) So the
INVITE's VIA would reflect the contents of the proxy-require header.

While handling CANCEL at proxy,
P1 calculates the VIA's loop-detection part without the Proxy-Require header,
As CANCEL would not have it.

At UAS:
INVITE & CANCEL would have different top-most via branches.

But according to RFC they have to have the same branches for the UAS to
match the CANCEL & INVITE properly.

"9.1 Client Behavior
...
A CANCEL constructed by a client MUST have only a single Via header field
value matching the top Via value in the request being cancelled.  Using the 
same
values for these header fields allows the CANCEL to be matched with the
request it cancels (Section 9.2 indicates how such matching occurs)."

Is it that Stateless proxies are not supposed to do loop-detection?

I thought the idea of having loop-detection part in branch-id was to
allow proxies to detect loop even while being stateless. If only stateful
proxies were to do loop-detection, we wouldn't have required the hash
to be kept in the message at all.

Thanks in advance
Sachin

Hi,

I'd like to know what the planned schedule for the I-D
draft-rosenberg-sip-reg is? There haven't been a lot of dicussions on the
list about this draft. I think a revision is needed based on the comments
raised in the following messages:

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg06113.html
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg06118.html
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/sip/current/msg06124.html

Are there any plans yet when this draft is supposed to move to WG LC? The
main reason I'm asking is that 3GPP needs this draft to finalise their
Release 5 specifications.

Regards,

Mark

I actually did not mean that these parameters should be copied when
converting SIP URLs into TEL URLs (I believe they should not be). What I was
trying to say is that even if they do appear in TEL URL used in a SIP
message for whatever reason, their meaning is not defined in SIP.

Thank you,
Igor Slepchin

Hi Mark,

The SIPPING WG asked for AD approval to adopt this as a WG item in 
SIPPING.  Currently Jonathan is aware that this needs a revision, but is 
working on another draft which is blocking other stuff now.  I'll try to 
get a realistic date soon.

thanks,
-rohan

I guess that sounds fine to me.

In fact, if they did appear in a TEL-URL, I guess we would put them in the user
part of the SIP-URI, as we do with all other TEL-URI parameters...

The branch parameter  should change with each request send by UAC  or per
Transaction Basis. If it is on transaction  basis INVITE and ACK should have
same branch parameter

In RFC 3261 Examples The branch parameter is different for  INVITE and ACK
message sent By UAC

 24.2 Session Setup

   This example contains the full details of the example session setup
   in Section 4.  The message flow is shown in Figure 1.  Note that
   these flows show the minimum required set of header fields - some
   other header fields such as Allow and Supported would normally be
   present.

ACK is only part of the transaction only if the response to the INVITE =
was an non-2xx final response. If the response was 200, then the ACK is =
a new transaction.
=20
The example you talk about below is for an INVITE than got a 200 ok =
response.

The branch parameter  should change with each request send by UAC  or =

should have same branch parameter

	Hi ,		

		I have a doubt Regarding the to tag field in the ACK .

		In RFC 3261 in section  17.1.1.3 Construction of the ACK
Request 
	It was said that The To  header field in the ACK must be  equal to
the To header field in the
	  response being acknowledged . 

	Suppose If the ACK contains the to tag field different from the one
in the ok message sent by the user agent 
	what will be the action taken by the user agent . whether it has to
reject this ACK and send ok messages 
	or it has to send any other message saying that ACK has wrong to tag
.


	And also Suppose If the ACK does not contains the to tag at all
.what will be the action taken by the user agent .

	Hi ,		

		I have a doubt Regarding the to tag field in the ACK .

		In RFC 3261 in section  17.1.1.3 Construction of the ACK
Request 
	It was said that The To  header field in the ACK must be  equal to
the To header field in the
	  response being acknowledged . 

	Suppose If the ACK contains the to tag field different from the one
in the ok message sent by the user agent 
	what will be the action taken by the user agent . whether it has to
reject this ACK and send ok messages 
	or it has to send any other message saying that ACK has wrong to tag
.


	And also Suppose If the ACK does not contains the to tag at all
.what will be the action taken by the user agent .

As per RFC 3261, INVITE MUST have the "From" tag. Which is not given in your
message flow.
While your other UA is 3261 compliant, providing it's tag. It's also
backward compatible with
older UA's (RFC 2543) which may not give the TAG, as it is accepting the REQ
and in the  
 RSP giving the TO-TAG.
 
The originating UA should copy the Complete TO field including the Tag in
the RSP. If remote side
is supporting complete backward compatibility with older RFC 2543, It can
accept the ACK without
 the tag. It depends how much it is backward compatible.
 
Thx
Samir

Subject: [Sip] Regarding the to tag field in the ACK



        Hi ,            

                I have a doubt Regarding the to tag field in the ACK . 

                In RFC 3261 in section  17.1.1.3 Construction of the ACK
Request 
        It was said that The To  header field in the ACK must be  equal to
the To header field in the 
          response being acknowledged . 

        Suppose If the ACK contains the to tag field different from the one
in the ok message sent by the user agent 
        what will be the action taken by the user agent . whether it has to
reject this ACK and send ok messages 
        or it has to send any other message saying that ACK has wrong to tag
. 


        And also Suppose If the ACK does not contains the to tag at all
.what will be the action taken by the user agent .

ACK for 2XX is different Transaction. 
While ACK for non 2xx final responses is the part of same INVITE
transaction. 
Therefore ACK for the 2xx is having different Branch ID.
 
Thx

The branch parameter  should change with each request send by UAC  or per
Transaction Basis. If it is on transaction  basis INVITE and ACK should have
same branch parameter

In RFC 3261 Examples The branch parameter is different for  INVITE and ACK
message sent By UAC 

 24.2 Session Setup 

   This example contains the full details of the example session setup 
   in Section 4.  The message flow is shown in Figure 1.  Note that 
   these flows show the minimum required set of header fields - some 
   other header fields such as Allow and Supported would normally be 
   present.

The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'Session Initiation Protocol
Extension for Instant Messaging' <draft-ietf-sip-message-07.txt> as a
Proposed Standard.  This document is the product of the Session
Initiation Protocol Working Group.  The IESG contact persons are
Allison Mankin and Scott Bradner.

 
Technical Summary
 
  RFC 2778 and RFC 2779 give a model and requirements for presence
  and instant messaging protocols. The Session Initiation Protocol
  (RFC 3261) provides mechanisms that are useful for presence
  applicatons, and for session-oriented communication applications.
  This document specifies a new method for SIP called MESSAGE, which
  adds an instant message mechanism as well, fulfilling
  RFC 2779. This IM mechanism is intended for pager style use,
  in which a MESSAGE carries a short text, or message/cpim body,
  as a stand-alone communication, rather than a stream of connected
  data, in a "session mode." The SIMPLE working group is currently
  working to understand the session model more fully and determine
  how SIMPLE should best support it (for instance with multiple
  types of session modes).
   
Working Group Summary
   
  The requirements for this specification originated in the
  IMPP and SIMPLE Working Groups, and then the protocol
  extension was completed by SIP. The major point of contention
  was to ensure that MESSAGE did not become a congestion-prone
  transport-replacement, taking advantage of SIP's original ability
  to run over UDP. Fortunately, beginning with RFC 3261, any SIP
  message with a large payload is likely to use TCP for its transport.
  The MESSAGE specification achieved strong working group and
  Transport area consensus after vigorous discussion of its first
  few revisions.

Protocol Quality
   
    Allison Mankin reviewed the specification for the IESG.
    Several early commercial implementations have been identified.


Note to RFC Editor:

Please make the following changes:

Before the Introduction, add an unnumbered section -

Terminology

      In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
      "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
      RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 and indicate requirement levels for
      compliant SIP implementations.

-------
References

Add RFC 2119 to Normative references.


-------

11. Security Considerations

Old:

      In particular, UAs that
      support the MESSAGE request SHOULD support end-to-end authentication,
      body integrity, and body confidentiality mechanisms.
New:

      In particular, UAs that
      support the MESSAGE request MUST implement end-to-end authentication,
      body integrity, and body confidentiality mechanisms.

------
11.1 Outbound authentication

Old:
      When local proxies are used for transmission of outbound messages,
      proxy authentication is RECOMMENDED. This is useful to verify the
      identity of the originator, and prevent spoofing and spamming at the
      originating network.

New:
      When local proxies are used for transmission of outbound messages,
      proxy authentication, as specified in RFC 3261, is RECOMMENDED. 
      This is useful to verify the identity of the originator, and prevent
      spoofing and spamming at the originating network.

------
11.3 End-to-End Protection

Old:
      To alleviate the concerns stated above, the MESSAGE bodies SHOULD be
      secured with S/MIME.

New:

      For remedying the concerns stated above, the MESSAGE bodies
      MUST be secured with S/MIME. If bodies specified in future to be
      carried by the MESSAGE method have different means of providing
      end-to-end security, their specification MUST describe the usage.
-------

11.4 Replay Prevention

OLD:
   To prevent the replay of old SIP requests, all signed MESSAGE
   requests and responses SHOULD contain a Date header field covered by
   the message signature.


NEW:

   To prevent the replay of old SIP requests, all signed MESSAGE
   requests and responses MUST contain a Date header field covered by
   the message signature.

This memo specifies an Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) based
one-time password generation mechanism for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) Digest access authentication.  The HTTP Authentication
Framework includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both
schemes employ a shared secret based mechanism for access
authentication.  The AKA mechanism performs user authentication and
session key distribution in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-response based mechanism that
uses symmetric cryptography.

Hi
Consider Scenario
UAC -> UAS


UAC sends  INVITE with URI 's   LittleGuy@there.com in both startline and To
Header Field.

After receiving  OK, UAC sends  ACK with URI   LittleGuy@there.com in To
Header Field
    and SmallGuy@there.com   in Startline. Whether UAS  should  accept ACK
or reject  with   error. 

Thanks
Abdul Sattar

It is per transaction.

> If it is on transaction basis INVITE and ACK 
> should have same branch parameter

The ACK is a special case.  The ACK's branch
changes for 2xx response; the ACK's branch
remains the same for other final responses.

Hi,

This is with reference to the SIP INFO Method defined in RFC2976.
SIP INFO method is used for sending mid call signaling information. The way
information is sent by a UAC to UAS is clear. But I have one basic question:
1. How does the UAC generating this INFO message know that the UAS is
ineterested in knowing that event.
2. Also we have SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages in SIP which can be used to
subscribe for soem information and then report the same. So in what way is
INFO different than these ..
Could somebody please answer these questions ?

regards
Himanshoo

Hi Himanshoo

SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY methods are used to register for specific events like
call fowrward, automatic call back , etc.

while INFO method is used to convey mid session information. The INFO method
only provides optioanl extra information. So UAC may not know whether UAS is
interested in the information or not.

Hi Himanshoo,
	While it is theoritically possible to generate a complete Event framework
of INFO methods, the SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY methods provide the formal Event
framework for SIP.
	As Ranjit had mentioned, INFO conveys optional extra information and in the
case of INFO, the UAC does not care if the UAS requires it or not.  The
precise difference lies in this point.  In the Event framework, the UAC
(Notifier) caters to what the UAS (Subscriber) requires, while the INFO
mechanism is adhoc.
	As in case of SIP-T like applications, where INFO is used, the UAS may drop
the message totally, while in the case of NOTIFICATIONs it is not expected
to do that, as he requested the notification.
Regards,
Prasanna

Hi,

I have a question on draft-culpepper-sip-info-event-00.txt:

1. It says that MGCP subtype can be used to indicate the protocol between
MGC and MG and then some MGCP message can be encapsulated to request and
report the events as per MGCP packages. Does this mean that I can send the
complete command line ( I mean whole of RQNT) as message body for the INFO
request. It is needed since I also need to identify the end point where I
want event to be detected.

2. And more importantly, as per the date mentioned ni draft, this draft has
expired on October 2000. Is there some other draft / RFC which is taing care
of there issues ? Should I refer to some other document for finding solution
to this problem.

regards
Himanshoo

Hi Himanshoo

  if there is any extra info to be conveyed to UAS, then UAC generates INFO
request and sends it to UAS. but if UAS is not interested in the info, then
UAS can respond with "487 Request Cancelled" response.

HTH

Your mail says that:

"while INFO method is used to convey mid session information. The INFO
method
only provides optioanl extra information. So UAC may not know whether UAS is
interested in the information or not."

If UAS can't tell what information it is interested in, then what is the use
of INFO method...

Also, then how does UAC decide which information to send.

Hi Himanshoo

SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY methods are used to register for specific events like
call fowrward, automatic call back , etc.

Subject: [Sip] SIP INFO


Hi,

This is with reference to the SIP INFO Method defined in RFC2976.
SIP INFO method is used for sending mid call signaling information. The way
information is sent by a UAC to UAS is clear. But I have one basic question:
1. How does the UAC generating this INFO message know that the UAS is
ineterested in knowing that event.
2. Also we have SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages in SIP which can be used to
subscribe for soem information and then report the same. So in what way is
INFO different than these ..
Could somebody please answer these questions ?

regards
Himanshoo

HI Ranjit,
	I do not believe 487 is a suitable response for such a condition.  As such
there is no response that is suitable that is usable in this case, but we
can respond with a 400 response.  But do we even have an agreement that this
is a client error!
Rgds,
Prasanna

HI Ranjit,
	I do not believe 487 is a suitable response for such a condition.  As such
there is no response that is suitable that is usable in this case, but we
can respond with a 400 response.  But do we even have an agreement that this
is a client error!

Hi Himanshoo

  if there is any extra info to be conveyed to UAS, then UAC generates INFO
request and sends it to UAS. but if UAS is not interested in the info, then
UAS can respond with "487 Request Cancelled" response.

Your mail says that:

"while INFO method is used to convey mid session information. The INFO
method
only provides optioanl extra information. So UAC may not know whether UAS is
interested in the information or not."

If UAS can't tell what information it is interested in, then what is the use
of INFO method...

Also, then how does UAC decide which information to send.

Subject: [Sip] SIP INFO


Hi,

This is with reference to the SIP INFO Method defined in RFC2976.
SIP INFO method is used for sending mid call signaling information. The way
information is sent by a UAC to UAS is clear. But I have one basic question:
1. How does the UAC generating this INFO message know that the UAS is
ineterested in knowing that event.
2. Also we have SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages in SIP which can be used to
subscribe for soem information and then report the same. So in what way is
INFO different than these ..
Could somebody please answer these questions ?

regards
Himanshoo

As such 487 is sent when a cancellation of a request is triggered by the UAC
itself (conditions like CANCEL, expiration of the request), but I do not
believe that this is a UAC triggered cancellation.  I withdraw my suggestion
for a 400, for I am also not convinced if UAC behaves erroneously sending
this request or the server behaves erroneously by not able to understand
this.
Do we have a clarity if this is a client error or a server error?

Hi ,

After reading all of your mails I looked at some of the drafts which are
related to carrying MGCP events  / messages inside SIP INFO Message. If I
follow that approach then it appears that I can first send an INFO request
and include 'MGCP Requested Events' to request detection of events. Later
when that event is deteted, the detectng entitiy will send another INFO
Request with 'MGCP observed events' . By using this approach I can control
the events which are reported to the requestign entity.
This is one use of the INFO message which seems to be very useful.

Regards
Himanshoo

it is neither a clinet nor server error, but UAS sends 487 indicating to UAC
that it is not interested in accepting the request.

As such 487 is sent when a cancellation of a request is triggered by the UAC
itself (conditions like CANCEL, expiration of the request), but I do not
believe that this is a UAC triggered cancellation.  I withdraw my suggestion
for a 400, for I am also not convinced if UAC behaves erroneously sending
this request or the server behaves erroneously by not able to understand
this.
Do we have a clarity if this is a client error or a server error?

487 is ok be'se if UAS does not want to accept the INFO request, it will

HI Ranjit,
	I do not believe 487 is a suitable response for such a condition.  As such
there is no response that is suitable that is usable in this case, but we
can respond with a 400 response.  But do we even have an agreement that this
is a client error!

Hi Himanshoo

  if there is any extra info to be conveyed to UAS, then UAC generates INFO
request and sends it to UAS. but if UAS is not interested in the info, then
UAS can respond with "487 Request Cancelled" response.

Your mail says that:

"while INFO method is used to convey mid session information. The INFO
method
only provides optioanl extra information. So UAC may not know whether UAS is
interested in the information or not."

If UAS can't tell what information it is interested in, then what is the use
of INFO method...

Also, then how does UAC decide which information to send.

Hi,

This is with reference to the SIP INFO Method defined in RFC2976.
SIP INFO method is used for sending mid call signaling information. The way
information is sent by a UAC to UAS is clear. But I have one basic question:
1. How does the UAC generating this INFO message know that the UAS is
ineterested in knowing that event.
2. Also we have SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages in SIP which can be used to
subscribe for soem information and then report the same. So in what way is
INFO different than these ..
Could somebody please answer these questions ?

regards
Himanshoo

- Section 4: it says:

"If a client sends a compressed request, it SHOULD add the parameter
   comp=sigcomp to the topmost entry of the Via header field."

Why isn't that so also for proxies?


Section 5: Second and third paragraph. What is the purpose of this? If I understand correctly, it is to allow the UAC sending compressed requests within this dialog. But this doesn't work.

Consider this scenario


UA1 --- P1 --- P2 --- P3 --- UA2

P1 wants to compress
P2 doesn't want to compress
P3 wants to compress

They all record-route

Initial INVITE from UA1 is not compressed. So INVITE arrive at UA2 looking like this:

INVITE: sip:ua2@example.com SIP/2.0
via: p3
via: p2
via: p1
via:ua1
Record-route: <p1;comp=sigcomp> , <p2> , <p3;comp=sigcomp>
contact: ua1
...


Response from UA2 to P2 looks like:

SIP/2.0 200 Ok
via: p2
via: p1
via:ua1
Record-route: <p1;comp=sigcomp> , <p2> , <p3;comp=sigcomp>
...

According to the above mentioned paragraphs, P3 removes its comp=sigcomp and forwards response to P2:

SIP/2.0 200 Ok
via: p1
via:ua1
Record-route: <p1;comp=sigcomp> , <p2> , <p3>
...

Again P2 applies the same logic, but this time adds comp=sigcomp, therefore making the response sent to P1 look like

SIP/2.0 200 Ok
via:ua1
Record-route: <p1;comp=sigcomp> , <p2;comp=sigcomp> , <p3>

and finally P1 will remove comp=sigcomp. Record-Route header looks like

Record-route: <p1> , <p2;comp=sigcomp> , <p3>

That is not the desired behaviour. The requirement should be that each proxy that record-routes examines the contact-header sent in the request and add/remove comp=sigcomp in the record-route header of the response. In this way, if the UAC wishes for requests within dialogs to be compressed, it indicates so in the contact-header.

Hisham

Hi,

As you noted, that I-D is expired.  In addition, work is being done to 
define a general mechanism for conveying user indications to support 
user interaction with applications.  The current I-Ds are:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sipping-markup-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-culpepper-sipping-app-interact-reqs-01.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fairlie-sipping-netapp-session-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-culpepper-sip-key-events-01.txt

You can expect an update to the requirements I-D shortly I believe.  And 
a general framework, to follow.

The idea was that the the call identifying info in the SIP request would 
be used by the MGC to identify MGCP/Megaco connection.  Just as it would 
for any other interworking function.  The only proposed INFO message 
content was the actual event request/notification.

Yes, the forthcoming I-Ds mentioned above.

Hi ,

After reading all of your mails I looked at some of the drafts which are
related to carrying MGCP events  / messages inside SIP INFO Message. If I
follow that approach then it appears that I can first send an INFO request
and include 'MGCP Requested Events' to request detection of events. Later
when that event is deteted, the detectng entitiy will send another INFO
Request with 'MGCP observed events' . By using this approach I can control
the events which are reported to the requestign entity.
This is one use of the INFO message which seems to be very useful.

Regards
Himanshoo

Actually 487 does not seem to be a correct response to INFO ...
When the originator of the INFO wishes to cancel the INFO sent, it sends a
CANCEL, and 487 can only be sent in response to this CANCEL request.

Per RFC 2976, sec. 2.2:
      A 200 OK response MUST be sent by a UAS for an INFO request with
      no message body if the INFO request was successfully received for
      an existing call.  Beyond that, no additional operations are
      required.
and
      If a server receives an INFO request with a body it understands,
      but it has no knowledge of INFO associated processing rules for
      the body, the body MAY be rendered and displayed to the user. The
      INFO is responded to with a 200 OK.

      If the INFO request contains a body that the server does not
      understand then, in the absence of INFO associated processing
      rules for the body, the server MUST respond with a 415 Unsupported
      Media Type message.

From the above, it seems to mean that:
1. If the (SIP) request is syntactically incorrect,
   it sends a 400
2. If it is syntactically correct, but doesn't understand the (SDP) body,
   it sends 415
3. If it is syntactically correct, and it also understands the body,
   but does not implement the processing rules for the request,
   it sends a 200

Apart from the above, I guess only 481 and 501 are other possible responses.

Hence, if the sender of INFO receives a 200, it has no way of knowing
whether the other end has actually processed the request or has ignored the
same.

As such 487 is sent when a cancellation of a request is triggered by the UAC
itself (conditions like CANCEL, expiration of the request), but I do not
believe that this is a UAC triggered cancellation.  I withdraw my suggestion
for a 400, for I am also not convinced if UAC behaves erroneously sending
this request or the server behaves erroneously by not able to understand
this.
Do we have a clarity if this is a client error or a server error?

487 is ok be'se if UAS does not want to accept the INFO request, it will
cancel it. U cannot send 400 Bad Request be'se its not a bad request.

HI Ranjit,
	I do not believe 487 is a suitable response for such a condition.  As such
there is no response that is suitable that is usable in this case, but we
can respond with a 400 response.  But do we even have an agreement that this
is a client error!

Hi Himanshoo

  if there is any extra info to be conveyed to UAS, then UAC generates INFO
request and sends it to UAS. but if UAS is not interested in the info, then
UAS can respond with "487 Request Cancelled" response.

Your mail says that:

"while INFO method is used to convey mid session information. The INFO
method
only provides optioanl extra information. So UAC may not know whether UAS is
interested in the information or not."

If UAS can't tell what information it is interested in, then what is the use
of INFO method...

Also, then how does UAC decide which information to send.

Hi Himanshoo

SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY methods are used to register for specific events like

Hi,

This is with reference to the SIP INFO Method defined in RFC2976.
SIP INFO method is used for sending mid call signaling information. The way
information is sent by a UAC to UAS is clear. But I have one basic question:
1. How does the UAC generating this INFO message know that the UAS is
ineterested in knowing that event.
2. Also we have SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages in SIP which can be used to
subscribe for soem information and then report the same. So in what way is
INFO different than these ..
Could somebody please answer these questions ?

regards
Himanshoo

You imply that VoIP is one more web service.  This makes perfect sense for
PC-like user interfaces, but does it make sense for SIP phones?

Laptops with side tone & echo control (MS Messenger 4.7) are decent
speakerphones and PDA's are decent mobile phones. There are also 802.11
IP phones emerging. Why should we make a difference? They are all IP
hosts running SIP and RTP IMHO.

The IESG has approved publication of the following Internet-Draft as 
a Proposed Standard:

o Internet Media Types message/sipfrag 
<draft-ietf-sip-sipfrag-00.txt>

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol 
Working Group. The IESG contact persons are Allison Mankin and 
Scott Bradner.

Technical Summary

The spec registers the message/sipfrag MIME media type. This 
type is similar to message/sip, but allows certain subsets of well 
formed SIP messages to be represented instead of requiring a complete 
SIP message. In addition to end-to-end security uses, message/ 
sipfrag is used with the REFER method to convey information about the 
status of a referenced request. The message/sipfrag is used with 
S/MIME for gaining integrity and other security services. Advice 
is given for anti-replay and reference integrity when used. The 
type is not analogous to message/partial.

Working Group Summary 

The working group had excellent consensus on this document. 
NOTE: the document was Last Called along with draft-ietf-sip- 
refer under another its original internet-draft name of 
draft-sparks-sip-mimetypes. 

Changes to the document represent responses to the Last Call 
and IESG comments and improved clarity, security, anti-replay, 
protection, reference integrity. 

Protocol Quality 

The specification was reviewed for the IESG by Allison Mankin. 
Last Call comments by the IESG on sipfrag resulted in considerable 
clarification of the document.


Note to RFC Editor:

Please insert the following just before section 2:

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
    described in [RFC 2119].

and add the following to the normative references

   [RFC2119] Bradner, S., "Key words for use in RFCs to 	
   Indicate Requirement Levels.", RFC 2119, March 1997


Also, please make the following reference correction:

Old:

      The concepts in that section can be extended to allow SIP entities to
      make assertions about a subset of a SIP message (for example, as
      described in [3]).

New:
      The concepts in that section can be extended to allow SIP entities to
      make assertions about a subset of a SIP message (for example, as
      described in [4]).

In future, when you want to ask questions about how to interpret the SIP=20=

specification, please send your question instead to sip-
implementors@cs.columbia.edu.

To answer your specific question, there is no requirement that the=20
request-URI has to be the same in both INVITE and ACK.  The request-URI=20=

for the ACK is typically copied from the Contact header in the 2xx=20
response to the INVITE.

As per your mail , it says :
"The only proposed INFO message content was the actual event
request/notification."
Does this mean (a part of or full ) event request / notification message ,
as per MGCP ?

u cannot use SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY be'se you get NOTIFY when there is a change in
the state of the subscription. but here the case is of event detection. so
as Himanshoo says INFO could be useful

Hi ,

After reading all of your mails I looked at some of the drafts which are
related to carrying MGCP events  / messages inside SIP INFO Message. If I
follow that approach then it appears that I can first send an INFO request
and include 'MGCP Requested Events' to request detection of events. Later
when that event is deteted, the detectng entitiy will send another INFO
Request with 'MGCP observed events' . By using this approach I can control
the events which are reported to the requestign entity.
This is one use of the INFO message which seems to be very useful.

Regards
Himanshoo

Hi,

I have certain questions related to the scenario explained below. In
addition to the questions, can somebody please also comment if my
understanding is correct:

SCENARIO
-------------
Caller first dials a service access number and therefore call is given to
the App Server by switch :

Caller --(INVITE)--> Switch--(INVITE)--> App Server

After this App Server Invites Media Server into the call and collects the
destination number to which caller wants to talk to .

After getting the destination number , App Server would request the switch
to connect caller to destination number . But Application Server would
always like to monitor the call progress (e.g. is and when call was
answered/terminated/media characteristics changed). So finally it will be
like this:

                    App Server

                         ^
                         | (Monitoring Link)

Caller----> Switch ----->Destination


App server acts as controller . After playing the prompt to user, it
collects digits from user and then it has to connect caller to the called
party. Now I donot want the to develop a module on App Server, which
connects two parties in a call, because softswitch already knows how to do
it.. SO I use REFER (with refer-to field = Destination Number) to ask switch
to connect caller to the destination number, and automatically I am
subscriber for progress of the INVITE which is used to INVITE the
destination number . In additon I need the following:

1. Capability to do Remote Hang UP : My controller should be able to
terminate call to the destination if the call duration exceeds 'allowed
time'. Can I do this using 'REFER ;method = BYE' ?
2. After initiating the dialog using 'REFER; method = INVITE', I also need
to know the progress of dialog. For example if either of caller and called
party hangsup, I need to stop billing. In other words, I want to subscribe
for the state of dialogs involving softswitch and Calling/Called Party.
First I want to know whether I can do this by sending a SUBSCRIBE , using
dialog package 'draft-ietf-sipping-dialog-package-00.txt'?
Also, I want to know whether the dailog state information as per
'draft-ietf-sipping-dialog-package-00.txt' can also notify me of changes in
media characteristics (i.e. SDP for the dialog).?
3. Further in another scenario, if the time allowed for the calling user
(i.e. pre-paid user) expires, and if I want to connect hm to a Media Server
for playing some prompt (to decide future course of action) , then can I do
this by sending 'REFER ; method = BYE for the dialog between softswitch and
called party' and then send 'REFER; method=INVITE for connecting to MRS; In
this case if I want to tell MRS to send the digits to APP server, instead of
switch , how do I do that?


Best Regards
Himanshoo

Where did you read that proxies are not clients?

When you provide an example like this, you should indicate on which
interface each SIP entity wants to compress. In fact, the purpose of the
paragraph you are referring to, is to avoid asymmetrical compression.
That is, if SIP messages from P1 to P2 are compressed, messages from P2
to P1 will be compressed as well.

In an example like this, you also have to define if, regardless of waht
they want, they support SigComp or not. I assume that they all support
it.

A proxy adding sigcomp to the Record-route will add it to the Via header
as well. Therefore the Vias in your example are likely to be different.
But anyway, let's focus on the R-R header.

If the proxies have record-routed like this, it is because they want the
following scenario:

UA1 --- P1 -c- P2 --- P3 -c- UA2

--- means no compression
-c- means SigComp

It should be UA2 to *P3* (not P2). And the Via headers are wrong again.

You do not mention the Contact header in the response, which would be
ua2;comp=sigcomp

Therefore, you already have bidirectional compression between P3 and
UA2, which was what you wanted.

Here you have bidirectional NO compression between P2 and P3, which is

Here you have bidirectinal NO compression between UA1 and P1, which was

This *IS* the intended behaviour if the proxies Record-Routed in the
request in the way you described it.

> The requirement should be that each proxy that record-routes examines the contact-header sent in the request and add/remove comp=sigcomp in the record-route header of the response. In this way, if the UAC wishes for requests within dialogs to be compressed, it indicates so in the contact-header.

This mechanism allows compression between proxies as well. That's why
you have to inspect the RR headers as well.

Hi,

While you are at it, you may want to add the Max-Forwards header to the
example messages in section 10. Max-Forwards headers are mandatory in RFC
3261.

Perhaps this is too late, but here is my last attempt to bring up the issue
of provisional response again. The last paragraph of section 8 is
self-contradictory.

   It has been suggested that provisional responses should not be
   allowed for pager-model MESSAGE requests.  However, it is not
   possible to require special treatment for MESSAGE, since many proxy
   servers will not be aware of the MESSAGE method.  Therefore MESSAGE
   requests will receive the same provisional response treatment as any
   other non-INVITE method, as described in the SIP specification.

The "same provisional response treatment as any other non-INVITE method, as
described in the SIP specification", is exactly as the first sentence said :
"provisional responses should not be allowed". I have raised the issue of
allowing provisional response for MESSAGE some months ago on the SIMPLE
mailing list but there has been no response from the authors. Here is the
link to the previous mails :

Well, why doesn't the draft say that? I was only guessing what those 2 paragraphs where trying to achieve. I guessed so because your example gives this impression, you say "This will allow the UAC sending compressed requests within this dialog." And the result was compression all the way.

You should change your example so it shows how asymmetrical compression is avoided, not how UAC can get compression all the way.

Also, if there is such requirement that a client can request compression all the way, then you need a solution for that.

Yes, your assumption is correct. Sorry for the inconvenience.

I was concentrating on RR and wasn't bothered with Vias.

Sorry again, I should have said "For clarity, only parts of the sip messages are shown".

Hi All,

This is with reference to the mail I wrote yesterday. Kindly read the
scenario explained below and please comment on my understanding / questions.
Also, let me ask my main question again , with reference to
'draft-ietf-sipping-dialog-package-00':

Following is quoted from the above mentioned package :

 ------------------------
Abstract

    This document defines a dialog event package for the SIP Events
architecture, along with a data format used in notifications for this
package. The dialog package allows users to subscribe to another user, and
receive notifications about the changes in state of INVITE initiated dialogs
that the user is involved in.

------------------------

Can I use this package to receive notification for INVITE initiated dialogs
that the initiator is not invo,ved in ( by using "REFER; method = INVITE") ?

If not this way then is there some other way , using SIP, in which a
controller(e.g. App Server) is allowed to have monitoring session with a
switching entity (softswitch) for calls which are actually maintained by the
switch but are also monitored for call processing events by the App Server ?

Kindly do comment...

regards

Himanshoo

This has nothing to do with the UPDATE spec. Sending a request with a 
body whose interpretation depends on whether the other side has sent a 
specific message or not, is a bad idea. There is no way to know whether 
or not that other message has been sent.

Anyway, this sounds academic. Is there a real problem here?

Dear all,

In RFC3261, page 58:

      Call-ID: All registrations from a UAC SHOULD use the same Call-ID
           header field value for registrations sent to a particular
           registrar.

           If the same client were to use different Call-ID values, a
           registrar could not detect whether a delayed REGISTER request
           might have arrived out of order.

   ....

   UAs MUST NOT send a new registration (that is, containing new Contact
   header field values, as opposed to a retransmission) until they have
   received a final response from the registrar for the previous one or
   the previous REGISTER request has timed out.

If a stateful proxy receive multiple REGISTER with the same Call-ID (but
different From, To, and Contact) from the same UAC before it receives the
final response, how should it handle these REGISTER messages?  According to
the above paragraphs, this is not allowed.


regards,
KJ Loh

Hi:

I had a discussion with some folks about the caller preferences draft, and we have some questions that we weren't able to answer by reading the document.

We understand that by not publishing the support for a feature set, the UA is not providing any information. Therefore, the feature set may or may not be supported at the UA.

But the question is, if the UA decides to provide information about a supported feature set, shall that information be complete?

We are thinking of the methods parameter in the Contact header for registration. In case the methods parameter is included, shall it be complete and list all the methods supported by the UA?

Example:

Contact: <sip:ua.example.com>;methods="INVITE,ACK,BYE,CANCEL,OPTIONS,REGISTER,UPDATE,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,PRACK,MESSAGE"

Some folks think that the complete list is not essential. In my opinion, if a feature is present, it should be complete. In this case, all the methods supported by the UA must be present.

Other folks didn't see the need to publish the support for methods like ACK (implicitly supported if INVITE is supported), or NOTIFY (implicitly supported if SUBSCRIBE is supported).

In my opinion, that assumption is always wrong, because the methods parameter indicates support for SIP methods, not for SIP capabilities.

I would like to hear the opinion of the WG to give us some guidance.

Last, but not least, whatever is the correct thing to do, can you please add a very clear sentence to the caller preferences draft, so that there is no doubt as with respect the interpretation?

Regards,

       Miguel

You are misreading the first sentence. This points out that the language
should be tuned. What the first sentence tried, (and failed) to convey
to you was that some people were saying the Message spec should forbid
provisional responses, that is make them a MUST NOT (an earlier draft
contained exactly this). 3261 makes non-INVITE provisionals SHOULD NOT. 


As for:
> http://mailman.dynamicsoft.com/pipermail/simple/2002-July/001664.html

I don't understand your motivation here at all. A provisional
response to a non-INVITE doesn't squelch retransmission over UDP - it
only slows it down. Lay out the timing of messages with and without
an immediate provisional and you'll see that you reduce the total number
of messages by exactly two - and you truly damage recovery time from
loss of the final response.

I thought we had responded to that one--sorry if it fell through the 
cracks. MESSAGE is based on the non-invite transaction model, where 
provisionals essentially do more harm than good. If we wanted to use 
provisionals for the purpose you suggest, we would need a completely new 
transaction model, which does not seem worthwhile.

as Himanshoo says INFO could be useful

Hi ,

After reading all of your mails I looked at some of the drafts which are
related to carrying MGCP events  / messages inside SIP INFO Message. If I
follow that approach then it appears that I can first send an INFO request
and include 'MGCP Requested Events' to request detection of events. Later
when that event is deteted, the detectng entitiy will send another INFO
Request with 'MGCP observed events' . By using this approach I can control
the events which are reported to the requestign entity.
This is one use of the INFO message which seems to be very useful.

Regards
Himanshoo

we are discussing two issues here.  one is how the UAS TU acts, and the 
other is how the non-INVITE transaction layer acts.  we can more 
stringently enforce UAS behavior for MESSAGE requests if we'd like.  two 
suggestions below (I prefer #1).

thanks,
-rohan


Suggested replacement text #1:
A UAS compliant to this specification MUST NOT respond to MESSAGE 
requests with a provisional response. Provisional responses to 
non-INVITE requests cause more harm than good (they prevent timely 
retransmission of the final response). Note that for 
backward-compatibility reasons, the SIP transaction layer still MUST be 
prepared to receive a provisional response to any request as described 
in RFC3261.

Suggested replacement text #2:
Provisional responses to MESSAGE requests are handled the same way as 
for any non-INVITE request. As discussed in RFC3261 section x.y, a UAS 
SHOULD NOT respond to MESSAGE requests (or other non-INVITE methods) 
with a provisional response. In general, provisional responses to 
non-INVITE requests cause more harm than good (they prevent timely 
retransmission of the final response).

The current version pretty much is the same as your option 2, except 
that avoided repeating the 3261 language. I guess that is a trade off 
between manageablility vs. convenience of the reader. Since 3261 is 
stable now, it is no big deal to add it in the author's 48.

As for option 1, I'm not sure why MESSAGE needs to have any more or less 
restriction here than any other non-invite method. If your desire is to 
strengthen the restriction for all non-invites, then it seems that the 
place to do that is in the base spec, not the extension.

It is worth noting that the original paragraph was there in response to 
an AD suggestion that was later withdrawn as we added more 
congestion-control language. It may be the best thing to do is strike 
the whole paragraph. Provisionals are treated the same as for any other 
non-invite, therefore this draft doesn't need to discuss them.

option 2 is also more clear than the current language.

well, since the base spec didn't say this, and won't be updated for a 
while, we certainly have a legitimate reason to say this now for all NEW 
non-INVITE extension methods.

i really want us to prevent folks from sending provisionals and CANCELs 
for non-INVITE.  I don't think that's a lot to ask.

Regardless of whether I agree that we should forbid provisionals for 
non-invite, I really hate to encumber MESSAGE with that discussion at 
this point in time--The IESG has approved the current version with a few 
unrelated edits. This seems a bit much for an author's 48 change.

Actually, RFC 2533 (which we are using) does say something concrete 
about what it means to say nothing about a feature tag. It means that 
you are supporting all values. This means you need to be careful about 
the semantics of the headers - the existing Reject-Contact semantic of 
"reject this contact if its feature set matches" is bad, because it will 
cause a UA to be rejected even if it has said nothing about a particular 
feature tag!

Yes.

Yes.

There was a thread on the list (likely followed by no one) between 
myself, Juha, and Paul K. on this exact issue. Our conclusion was that 
it was reasonable to mandate that a UA include all values it supports 
for a feature tag, when it includes that feature tag.

That is correct.

I would agree. Without listing all methods, you put the burden on the 
server to lean what other methods a UA will support based on the ones it 
listed. That won't always be a trivial exercise.

Yes. I have already done that in my working draft as a result of the 
aforementioned thread with Paul K. and Juha.

This is a little bit weird. I consider that the feature tags are not closed,
they are or will be expanding, and new feature tags will appear in the 
future. 

Imagine that my UA implements feature tags 1, 2 and 3. A new feature 4 is 
defined, and my proxy or the remote UA supports that feature, by not my UA. 
Then, are you saying that the proxy or the remote UA will think that my 
terminal supports feature 4 because my UA didn't say anything about that?

That is not what I consider support for backward compatibility.

Absolutely.

No, I'm not saying that.

 From the syntax in the contact header that describes the capabilities 
(the predicate), its clear what the UA is explicitly saying, and what 
its omitting. So, a UA that sees the predicate in a 200 OK to an INVITE, 
for example, will know what is supported and what is omitted, and so 
does a proxy that sees one in a REGISTER.

What I AM saying is that the matching operation used for routing doesn't 
care. If a caller places into an INVITE an Accept-Contact saying that 
feature tag 4 should have a value of foo, a proxy will route this call 
to UA's that explicitly indicate that they support this value, and to 
those that say nothing.

This is reasonable; the complete lack of information about a feature tag 
should not imply its not supported. Interoperability is better if you 
assume that no information means that it may or may not be supported, 
and then let the protocol itself deal with the situation where its not 
(i.e., reject with 405, 415, etc). This is explicitly called out in rfc2533:

This is an unusual case. The spec does prohibit a client from sending 
it. However, there is actually nothing wrong with this scenario, and the 
regular server processing in 10.3 will do the right thing. If the To 
field changes between the two registrations, the ordering is no longer 
relevant in terms of the processing of the two transactions - they refer 
to different addresses of record. It is totally irrelevant in this case 
that they happen to come from the same UA.

I strongly concur with Ben; the MESSAGE spec is not the place to change 
the wording on the strength of sending provisionals for non-INVITE requests.

Interesting.

The normative strengths in the specification are correct, but the 
recommended algorithm for performing the branch ID computation for loop 
detection will not work for stateless proxies, as you have identified. 
The algorithm in 16.11 for branch ID computation is stateless proxies is 
correct, but by its definition rules out loop detection using the branch 
ID computation in 16.6.

However, the spec doesn't explicitly point this out, and it should. The 
spec also needs to clarify that the branch ID computation for stateless 
proxies needs to be invariant across retranmits AND CANCEL AND ACK-non-2xx.

I've logged this into bugzilla:
http://www.sipwg.org/sipwg/show_bug.cgi?id=659

Really, loop detection is not something I would recommend. It has caused 
countless problems over the years and thats why max-forwards processing 
is now the preferred approach. So, just turn off loop detection and you 
won't have a problem.

Jonathan,

So are you saying that:

	Reject-Contact: *;class="personal"

should assume a mobility attribute of "any"  (Reject any personal 
contact whether mobile or not), and:

	Accept-Contact: *;class="business"

should also assume a mobility attribute of any (accept any business 
contact regardless of other attributes)?
(if so, i think this is goodness).

What would the status be of unincluded attributes in a REGISTER?  Is 
the semantic "unknown", "none", or "any"?

	Contact: <sip:rmahy@dhcp2357.cisco.com>;class=business
	Contact: <sip:rohan@iptel.org>;class=personal

thanks,
-rohan
