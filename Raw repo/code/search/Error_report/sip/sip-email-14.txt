[JRE] If we have a sips scheme that mandates TLS on all hops (whatever TLS
might mean) and fails if it can't achieve it, I think there is an equal
argument for a mechanism that requests TLS on all hops but still succeeds
and tells me if any hop does not meet this requirement. So if we recommend
the sip scheme for achieving best effort, it still doesn't tell me if it
succeeded. Yes, what I want would be a new mechanism, but it would not be
substantially more difficult to define than the SIPS mechanism. I am having
a hard time rationalising why we should specify an all-or-nothing mechanism
(sips) but not a best effort mechanism. In other words I am having a hard
time understanding the use cases for sips. Maybe the lack of plausible use
cases is part of the reason it hasn't been deployed much.
