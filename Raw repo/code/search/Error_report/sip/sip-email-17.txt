I agree with Jonathan's proposal.

Here is a slighly different perspective on it however. I'll keep
rethorical arguments
out of it, and stick to protocol.

- Disallowing re-targeting "upgrades" from SIP to SIPS by a proxy would
be
  a normative change to RFC 3261. Section 26.4.4 describes it (3rd
paragraph
  on p. 250). That is just an observation.

- The fact that it is currently allowed means that the UAS receiving the
request
  has to go through some fairly esoteric logic to "guess" if the request
was
  sent securily on each hop or not. This is described in paragraph 4 of
p. 250,
  and section 4.1 of draft-ietf-sip-sips-02 also describes it, with some
modifications.
  Those procedures are extremely cludgy and non-deterministic. They are
also misleading
  for the UAS, and inconsistent with the use of SIPS and SIP as
described in this draft
  (i.e., for the other scenarios of forwarding and retargeting). In all
other instances,=20
  the idea is that when a request is forwarded/retargeted, the scheme is
preserve.=20
  I'd really like to get rid of section 4.1.

	- Jonathan Peterson was proposing that the UAS inspect the To
header to see if=20
        the request was initially targeted at SIPS. This is a subset of
the procedures=20
        of 4.1/draft-ietf-sip-sips and of RFC 3261 (they add stuff like
looking at=20
        Via and other fields).

- This "upgrading" also forces the use of the double Record-Route in
section 4.2
  of draft-ietf-sip-sips-02. Since we agreed to deprecate the last hop
exception
  for downgrading, the SIPS-to-SIP Record-Route scenario will be removed
from the
  -03 version. Removing the "upgrade" scenario would also remove the
double=20
  Record-Route for the SIP-to-SIPS, and the net-net is that the whole
section
  4.2 could be removed.

- Because of rules described in RFC 3261, if a UAS receives an incoming
request with a=20
  SIPS Request-URI, it MUST use a SIPS contact. This is a big problem
for the sender
  of the initial request that initiated the dialog if that UAC did not
support SIPS.
  If Record-Routing is not used, it will just plainly not work. The UAC
will not be
  able to send further requests (like BYE for example). If Record-Route
is used, it=20
  might work (or it might not). The reason it might not work is that
there is possible
  that the UAC might "choke" on the SIPS URI in the Contact (because it
doesn't understand
  how to parse it).

	- We have corrected to types of problems everywhere else in this
draft. There was
	  quite a few of them in previous versions. This is the only one
remaining.

- Note that it would still be possible to "upgrade" by sending SIP over
TLS. In fact, I would
  argue that we need to put a requirement to do so when there is already
a TLS connection
  opened with the target (as would be the case if Outbound was used, and
the registration was
  done over TLS).

In summary, I favor deprecating the "retargeting upgrade" scenario for
the following reasons:

- It greatly simplifies the draft, eliminating sections 4.1 and 4.2
completely.

- It is much less confusing for the far end.

- It avoids some nasty protocol level problems that "break" things.

- You can still use TLS for transport for delivering to that last hop.
