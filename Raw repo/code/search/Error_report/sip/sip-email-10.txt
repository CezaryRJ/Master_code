>> A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line
>> Internet-Drafts directories.
>> This draft is a work item of the Session Initiation Protocol
>> Working Group of the IETF.
>>
>> 	Title		: Diagnostic Responses for SIP Hop Limit Errors
>> 	Author(s)	: S. Lawrence, et al.
>> 	Filename	: draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics-02.txt
>> 	Pages		: 12
>> 	Date		: 2006-6-2
>> 	
>> The SIP protocol imposes a limit on the number of hops a request may
>> make from a sender to the recipient.  When this limit is reached, a
>> 483 error response is returned.  The present form of the 483 response
>> does not provide enough information for the sender or proxies on the
>> path to diagnose failures whose symptom is that the hop limit is
>> reached.  This document proposes additional diagnostic information to
>> be returned in a 483 response.
>>
>> Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIP working
>> group list at 'sip@ietf.org'.

> 	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
> 	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
> 	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
> 	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
> 	how to manipulate these messages.
