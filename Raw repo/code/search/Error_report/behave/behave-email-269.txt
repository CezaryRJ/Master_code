of hosts? In that case, code 10 would not be the right one, as the host
might still be reachable on a different port. I feel that the actual
choice of error code would vary - it could be code 10 or code 13
depending on the type of filtering.

What is the reason why we recommend NATs to generate a 'hard' ICMP error
response? Is it to help hosts to stop generating traffic that would get
dropped? It might not even be appropriate to send a hard error, as IP
packets may take different routes, and a NAT in one route should not
cause the entire flow to stop.

| 10 is:

|             10  Communication with Destination Host is
|                 Administratively Prohibited
|=20
| while 13 is:
|=20
|             13  Communication Administratively Prohibited    =20
|  [RFC1812]
|=20
| '10' seems to (at least more strongly) imply that all=20
| communication with the destination address is=20
| administratively prohibited.
|=20
| 13 is less specific; the same code applies even if you=20
