Assuming that action is required and this is not just an interesting
discussion -

Can someone give a best guesstimate as regards what timeframe the =
problem is
likely to severly affect Internet performance - are we talking 3 years =
or 10
or further?

That should help to indicate whether a bandaid approach is absolutely
necessary or whether a more wholistic approach should be concentrated =
on.

I certainly suggest you avoid trying to do both on the same list (if =
both
are necessary)

The next step after this preliminary analysis would be to evaluate
realistically what could be done (that=92s means implemented, not just a
standard) in the timeframe in which action is needed.

I believe that a week or so ago a list was created to address the=20
problem you describe.  As I understand it, this list was created to=20
address the fact that for the past 30 years the Internet has shirked=20
its responsibility to do the work necessary to provide a complete and=20
well thought out architecture.

As was expressed at the beginning of this discussion a few weeks ago,=20
we have to give up this constant band-aid approach.  We have to find=20
the *solutions.*  Then we can trade our band-aids in for steps toward=20
an answer.

As for transport, yes, we do have a number of bad examples in the data.
