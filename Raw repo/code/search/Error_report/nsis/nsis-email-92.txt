This results in GIST using RAO as a transport, which is simply
a layering violation.  Again, there's no reason to not allocate a  
separate
option for carrying this value.  Please consider the case of
GISTv2.  What do you?  Allocate more RAO values?  What happens if
there's some other subsequent protocol that wants hop-by-hop
visibility.  Do you allocate bits for that protocol from RAO as well?
Suppose that it needs to co-exist with GIST.  Do you allocate code
points for the cross product of the two protocol code points?  What
happens if there's a third protocol?

I'm suggesting another IP option that has semantics independent
from RAO that would be wholly used for GIST.

Thanks for the reference.  I'm afraid that I don't agree with all of the
rationale presented there.

I'm fine with reusing RAO.  That is in fact exactly what it's there  
for.  However,
RSVP does not attempt to piggyback any data into RAO.  That's where
you're diverging from the previous model and exactly where I have an
issue.

The whole point of RAO is to take the packet out of the fast path,
regardless of the value.  An NSIS implementation could, if it was
carefully and specifically constructed to do so, have a fast path
that did understand the signaling protocol and passed uninteresting
versions in the fast path.  There's no reason that this could not
be done with an option independent of RAO.

This results in GIST using RAO as a transport, which is simply
a layering violation.  Again, there's no reason to not allocate a  
separate
option for carrying this value.  Please consider the case of
GISTv2.  What do you?  Allocate more RAO values?  What happens if
there's some other subsequent protocol that wants hop-by-hop
visibility.  Do you allocate bits for that protocol from RAO as well?
Suppose that it needs to co-exist with GIST.  Do you allocate code
points for the cross product of the two protocol code points?  What
happens if there's a third protocol?

I'm suggesting another IP option that has semantics independent
from RAO that would be wholly used for GIST.
