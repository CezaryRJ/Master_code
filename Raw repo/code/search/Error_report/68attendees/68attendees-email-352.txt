Whose cultural norms?

Sounds the same to me.

I never said they are invalid, but I do have trouble swallowing the 
assertion that the entire conference and choice of city was a wash because 
of them, which was the perspective I was getting from prior posts to the 
list.

My mother has a potentially fatal bee allergy.  Were she to come to IETF 
as a contributor during a season when bees are active, I would find it 
absurd of her to assert that the conference facility or the host city 
must guarantee her a bee-free environment in the region of the hotel.

I have some pretty terrible hayfever sometimes during allergy season.  I 
would never consider demanding that we avoid any city with pollens to 
which I am allergic even though their presence in the air would render me 
of limited use to the working groups I wish to attend because I'd be 
reduced to a sneezing mess.  I would either cope with the problem, 
treat the symptoms as best I can, or attend remotely (e.g. via jabber).

> Spoken like someone who is not bothered by it.

Correct, but I've also given examples of things that do bother me a great 
deal which still wouldn't compel me to claim the environment was 
unacceptable for the conference.  Same logic, same opinion.
