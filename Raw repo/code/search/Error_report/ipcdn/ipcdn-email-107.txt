I agree if no one ever looked at the data inside the modem, but just looked
at a manager which properly displayed the BITS element as a set of
enumerated bit values, you would have no problem.  But some managers will
only show the value as an octet string in hex and you will be looking at a
dump of the configuration file and comparing it to what you see in SNMP and
there will be an opportunity for misuderstanding where there needn't be.

What Mike said below is still true, the agent will have to swap the bits in
the word before returning it in an SNMP reply.  People make mistakes, and
this is just one more place that some implementations may swap the bits and
some may not.

Guys -

Your confusing the MIB with the implementation - again.  The MIB is an
abstraction of how things work underneath.  the BITS construct just maps a
set of true/false values into an underlying construct that can get
transmitted across the network.  At the agent end, ignore the bit position
and concentrate on the bit meaning.  In other words, if the
suppressPayloadHeaders bit is set in this , do whatever you would normally
do for suppressPayloadHeaders.  If that's setting the corresponding bit in
a MAC request, then so be it, but these things ARE NOT LINKED except by the
name's meaning - the assignment of the actual bit position is a transport
mapping, nothing more and must not be too closely tied to some other field.

We had this same discussion in packet cable on the syslog level meanings of
the docsDevEvent priority levels.
