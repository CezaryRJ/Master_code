Subject: Questions about the "Authentication Information" optional parameter

I have some questions about the "Authentication Information" optional 
parameter in the BGP OPEN message.

Have any authentication codes been defined anywhere?

Does any implementation actually support this method of authentication (as 
far as I know everyone uses RFC 2385 which uses a TCP MD5 signature 
instead)?

If it is not used in real life should we remove the "Authentication 
Information" optional parameter from the draft (or at least deprecate it)?

If no "Authentication Information" parameter was exchanged, it seems that 
the 16 marker bytes are a complete waste of space. Would it make sense to 
define a capability (or maybe an authentication code) which means 
"subsequent messages after the OPEN message will not contain the marker 
bytes".
