>Yes, but the things I mention are requirements that the Working Group must address. I favor listing requirements explicitly and treating other items as "potentially out of scope". We might, for example, decide that the best thing to do about, say, transliterations is "nothing". But we must decide in this iteration what to do about extlangs.

I don't see any reason why we wouldn't. The things that you mention
to me are obvious details, not things that need to be called out
because otherwise there would be major misunderstandings.

Is it still not correct? If yes, how?

>I'm allergic to artificial dependencies, based on our experience with 3066bis. ISO 639-3 might (unlikely as it probably is) take longer than Peter imagines. Our drafts, meanwhile, might go very quickly [if we can avoid the tar pits surrounding issues I personally would prefer to see remain off-topic].

I understand that you want things to be done as quickly as possible.
And I agree. However, I don't think it would be appropriate for
the WG to finalize the new draft and send it to the IESG before
we know that ISO 639-3 is really approved, because the fact that
it is not fully approved may mean that there are some more
changes, in which case we have to go back and make some
changes, too. As ISO 639-3 is the major reason for our new
work, I wouldn't call this an "artificial" dependency.
