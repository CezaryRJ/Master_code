arbitrary number of nodes, which is the main goal of this plan. Sensor and
rooftop/mesh networks, for instance, have hundreds or thousands of nodes.

The objective of the workshop is to present state of the art research
results on data communication and topology control in rapidly growing area
of ad hoc and sensor networks, with emphasizes on localized techniques.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Medium access control
* Analytical, mobility and validation models
* Hybrid networks and wireless Internet
* Security in ad hoc networks
* Data management, query processing, and data delivery in sensor networks
* Unicast routing, multicasting, and broadcasting
* Geocasting and anycasting
* Energy-efficient and bandwidth-efficient protocols
* Quality of service in medium access control and routing
* Topology construction and maintenance
* Neighborhood discovery and mobility management
* Localized protocols for duty-cycled sensor networks
* Sensor area coverage problems
* Auto-configuration and network formation protocols and algorithms
* Relative positioning algorithms
* Lower bounds on information exchange required for localized solutions
* Network graph properties supporting localized protocols
* Worst and average case analysis on the deviation from optimal solutions
