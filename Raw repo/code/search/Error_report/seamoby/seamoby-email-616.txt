James,

We vote to re-open the selection phase. By the way, Rene Purnadi is one
of the author in the draft koodli and his involvement in this vote is
not based on 'sour grapes' but to seek a valid selection procedure.

Thank you.

Stefano Faccin, Rajeev Koodli, Franck Le, Jari T. Malinen, Rene Purnadi
and Srinivas Sreemanthula

All,

Pat and I made a selection for what to start with, not what to end with.
The WG will determine what the final technology looks like.

1) If you want to support or disagree with the selection of the starting
 ID, say so now please.

2) If there is not consensus that we should re-open the selection phase,
then we will move forward based on the selection in the next few days.

Thanx.

            jak
