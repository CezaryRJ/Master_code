Content : 

networks. The solution relies on LDP only and has no requirement of a 
multicast routing protocol in the network.  Protocol elements and 
procedures for this solution are described for rerouting a P2MP LSP 
in the following cases:1)network failure (link or node); 2)a better 
path emerges (e.g. new link available, metric change);3)planned 
maintenance. The rerouting mechanism described in this document can 
minimize the time of traffic disruption when network failure happens. 
It will also minimize the data duplication and guarantee the traffic 
continuity during the procedure of rerouting in the last two cases 
mentioned above.

NOTE:	The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
	MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
	feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
	command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
	a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
	exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
	"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
	up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
	how to manipulate these messages.
