Frootocols  
through more or less transparently, so any device connected to the  
modem, such as a PC or a home gateway/router without the modem  
function built in, will have to engage in authentication directly. In  
the case of the integrated home gateway, the authentication  
credentials would be configured on the gateway and client PCs  
wouldn't have to run the authentication protcol.

If PCs are expected to run the authentication protocol, I have two  
issues (in addition to the ones already mentioned, of course). The  
first is that, assuming the same options are defined for IPv6, I  
would oppose a de-facto requirement that all IPv6 hosts run DHCPv6.  
(Or DHCP for IPv4, for that matter.) For IPv4 hosts, the requirement  
to run DHCP doesn't seem excessive, considering current practice. The  
other issue is how the authentication is started. If client is  
expected to initiate authentication in the first message, this means  
it's not possible to have a client that can seamlessly connect to  
multiple networks that require authentication because the client  
wouldn't know which credentials to use at any given time. Also, being  
easily prompted to send credentials would be a security isssue: an  
attacker could initiate frequent DHCP exchanges to harvast hashed  
credentials. (Experience with WEP shows that this can be detrimental  
under certain circumstances.) So a mechanism where the server  
authenticates itself to the client would be a lot better.

Also, one of the drafts mentions MD5, which is pretty much dead in  
the water with a huge hole in the hull right now, it's only a matter  
of time until it officially sinks.

Further, I'd like to see a more general mechanism. Another situation  
where users need to provide credentials that can benefit from better  
standards are wifi hotspots. This situation is largely similar to the  
DSL situation with the exception that there is often no direct  
relationship with the operator of the hotspot and the user, so the  
user must either select a roaming partner and provide credentials  
appropriate for that roaming partner, or use some other interactive  
method to gain temporary access (scratch cards, credit card  
transactions).

This suggests that a mechanism where unauthenticated users are given  
temporary access to a walled garden and then full access at some  
later point would be more appropriate than a simple success/fail  
authentication method.
