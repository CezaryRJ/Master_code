can come from more than one source (= interface), which is the most  
common situation in larger networks for non-customer sources. An  
alternative is "loose" uRPF which only rejects packets witch sources  
that don't appear in the routing table, which doesn't apply to  
attacks where the address of a working host is spoofed. I understand  
that there is work underway to allow uRPF with multiple sources but  
we'll have to see how well that works in practice. (One issue would  
be that it requires additional FIBs that could grow quite large.)

All of this assumes that it's a good idea to authenticate  
correspondents in interactions such as routing protocols solely based  
on the IP address they present. The fact that this "authentication"  
is trivially subverted by source address spoofing which is something  
that's easy to do in today's internet, suggests to me that this is a  
fundamentally broken approach.

Even if we assume that all ISPs do source address validation on  
packets that they receive from their customers, there are many ways  
to work around this. You'd basically have to require SEND for ALL  
subnets connected to the internet, but since this is something that's  
handled locally there is no way an ISP or a real authority would be  
able to know for sure this is done correctly. And obviously it's  
possible to subvert ISP infrastructure. There are so many ISPs that  
this alone is enough of a risk to invalidate the assumption that  
source addresses can be trusted.

Routing protocols and the like are generally run within  
administrative boundaries where it's possible to filter out unwanted  
packets coming from elsewhere so source address spoofing shouldn't be  
an issue today.

The exception is BGP, which is used to talk to external networks.  
Although there are some weak areas in implementations here that allow  
an attacker to run up CPU usage on most routers, techniques such as  
the BGP TCP MD5 password and GTSM should be sufficient to thwart  
spoofing attacks.

Current uRPF allows you to reject traffic that doesn't come from a  
single known "good" source, which isn't useful if legitimate traffic  
can come from more than one source (= interface), which is the most  
common situation in larger networks for non-customer sources. An  
alternative is "loose" uRPF which only rejects packets witch sources  
that don't appear in the routing table, which doesn't apply to  
attacks where the address of a working host is spoofed. I understand  
that there is work underway to allow uRPF with multiple sources but  
we'll have to see how well that works in practice. (One issue would  
be that it requires additional FIBs that could grow quite large.)
