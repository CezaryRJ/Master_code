I apologize that my mailer can't auto-generate the >> indentations and at t=
he moment I lack the patience to do it myself.

I agree with Pekka that it's important that there could be a legal implemen=
tation that did not offer encryption, so if you're going to go down this pa=
th some Null scheme has to be mandatory to implement.

But I still object to picking those algorithms as mandatory to offer. While=
 it guarantees interoperability between any two compliant implementations (=
which is good), it comes at a cost of disallowing *configurations* that onl=
y want to support some stronger hash or that don't want to accept NULL encr=
yption. I don't know whether an RFC can say anything about the mandatory *d=
efault* configuration, but I believe that's what you're really trying to ge=
t at.

I don't understand this comment.  Maybe the text is unclear (Section
5.2.7 I think), but AFAICS it just requires that the responder
includes _at_least_ either HMAC-SHA1-NULL or HMAC-SHA1-AES128CBC.
Nothing prevents it from including both and perhaps others.

If you implement HMAC-SHA1-AES128CBC, it is trivial to implement HMAC-
SHA1-NULL.

What is wrong with this?  To me this approach seems to be fine with
me; not all connections require encryption.
