during Last Call.

In that context, I can only applaud this document, not as a set 
of rules that the IESG has to follow, but as one that informs 
the community about the mechanisms the IESG is using. 
Information is good.  And, if the IESG discovers that it needs 
to update that information every time its membership changes (or 
every time they discover something isn't working and make an 
adjustment according), I'd consider that a sign of good health: 
at least it would show that, at least in this area, historical 
rules and behavior patterns are not constraining current 
thinking to the extent that replacing IESG members doesn't bring 
about change.

At the risk of giving a sales pitch, my other proposals have 
been intended to reinforce the model above: I think it is always 
going to be hard, in our community, to find IESG members who are 
good at doing these kinds of technical evaluations and sensitive 
to the issues involved and who are also outstanding managers, 
cat-herders, bureaucrats, finance experts, and experts on 
organizational behavior.   So I have sought to separate some of 
those roles.  I think that long terms on the IESG tend to breed 
detachment from the community and a tendency to put IESG 
judgment ahead of that of the community and I don't think we can 
solve that with more rules about IESG behavior.  So I have 
sought to give Nomcoms guidance about terms, to change the 
nomination/appointment model, and to make the recall mechanism 
more effective in practice.   And I have sought ways to simplify 
the job and reduce the workload in the hope that we can go back 
to treating a term or two on the IESG as an obligation that the 
right sorts of people owe the community, rather than a position 
to be sought and in the more general hope of broadening the pool 
of people who are willing to serve.

The fact that my proposals for change have not been instituted 
tells me that the community does not see a serious problem and 
doesn't believe that changes are needed.  While I believe that 
the lack of acceptance of changes has been IESG recalcitrance 
and efforts to protect the authority and ways of working with 
they are familiar and comfortable, I don't think that changes 
the conclusion: the community has ways, however unpleasant, for 
imposing changes that have community consensus but that it IESG 
doesn't like and has chosen to not use them.  I disagree, but I 
think the consensus-in-practice is fairly clear and I have to 
accept that.

To me, it is in the areas of adjusting IESG scope, 
responsiveness, and membership that we need to do our tuning, 
not by trying to restrict the IESG to particular ways of doing 
its technical evaluations or the statements ADs can make about 
specifications submitted for approval and especially what 
arguments an AD can use for forcing the rest of the IESG to take 
a harder look and initiate an in-depth discussion (internally 
and, if appropriate, with the community).  More hard rules about 
how the IESG does its technical evaluation work won't, IMO, help 
us in the common, ordinary, cases and, when an exceptional one 
arrives, such rules are likely to force the IESG into making the 
wrong decisions and doing the wrong things and thereby hurt the 
IETF and the Internet.
