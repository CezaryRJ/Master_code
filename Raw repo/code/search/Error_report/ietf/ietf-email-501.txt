there was any attempt to get a new format, or requirements to
comply with a prospective new format design effort, into the RFC
Editor RFP, it somehow seems to have missed me.

Your belief that they do not (I'd suggest that there is little
evidence that most users of our documents understand the real
difference between Proposed and Draft either) is not, I believe,
justification for nullifying the provisions of RFC 2026 and,
instead, substituting your (or the IESG's) judgment for them.

Our interpretation of "conservative" differs a bit in this case.
Given the identified problems with reliance on clear-text
challenge-response techniques, my version of "conservative"
would involve publishing a document that recognizes the wide
deployment and use of protocols of this sort but that carefully
explains (perhaps partially by reference, rather than inclusion
of everything in-line) the risks and limitations associated with
relying on them in unprotected environments.   If one does not
believe in recommendation levels, then it becomes an interesting
question about what maturity level should be assigned to such a
document, but I do not believe we have a model for Informational
documents superceding ("Obsoletes") a standards-track document.

I think both of those (spec quality and factors like security)
are useful and important.  But 2026 seems very clear on this
subject:

This specification is about as mature as it is going to get.  As
Frank has pointed out, the critical strings are actually
well-specified with regard to encoding, etc. and the others are
opaque and a server-only or client-only problem.  One can warn
against its use (and I think should do so), but the deployment
of the protocol gives all of the proof needed about utility.

Note that full Standards are different: the requirement there
(but only there) includes "provides significant benefit to the
Internet
community" and one could sensibly claim that a protocol,
especially one that was intended to enhance security, that posed
serious security risks if deployed carelessly does not, on
balance, provide such benefits.

I believe that, if there is a difference of opinion here, it is
that I believe that a widely-deployed, useful (in the opinions

> Next slide, yes, CRAM-MD5 is *not* designed for that attack.

That is my point. We should not, in 2006, standardize "security" methods
that are not robust against a fairly well known attack.

DIGEST-MD5 is somewhat more robust than CRAM-MD5 because it incorporates
protection against "chosen plaintext" attacks. If an attacker can fake a
server and send a chosen challenge, then the dictionary attack can be
accelerated with a pre-computed catalog. However, current dictionary
attacks do not need to rely on pre-computation, since a modern PC can
compute more than a million MD5 hashes per second. So, yes, DIGEST-MD5
has essentially the same issue.

ve deployed and used it) protocol for which
multiple independent implementations exist (and have been
deployed) should be documented and put/left on the standards
track as a specification of how things should be done if one
chooses to do those things.   I also believe that such a
document may reasonably contain any qualifying language -- and
even warnings and/or threats-- the community considers
appropriate and note that 2026 explicitly provides for AS
information to be folded into what would otherwise be a TS RFC.
So my view of what should be done with the standards-track RFCs
that are based on CRAM-MD5 is that the RFCs should be reissued,
with tightened definitions as needed, extensive security
considerations sections, and a strong recommendation to not use
the things except under specific and controlled circumstances.
If the documents meet the published requirements for Draft, then
they should be published at Draft.

The recent practice in the IESG appears to have been closer to
"if we don't like it or would not recommend it, it should not be
published at all, especially on the standards track no matter
how widely interoperable implementations are deployed".  I can
find little support for that position in RFC 2026 or elsewhere.
And, again, I don't recall hearing a proposal --to Newtrk or
elsewhere-- to change it.
