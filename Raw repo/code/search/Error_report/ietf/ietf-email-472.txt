Message- of course. But I hope

Right... my point here is that metrics are often eye opening -- for all
parties concerned. Even somewhat flawed and subjective metrics, so
long as they are taken with the proper grains of salt. My sense is that
if we did things like track DISCUSSes, time to resolution, length of
DISCUSS in proportion to, oh say, the length of the draft or oh say
the amount of time the working group took to get it to the IESG it
might frame some of these debates in something resembling reality.
Or as my initial suggestion about tracking whether these DISCUSS's
are paying off when you factor in that all engineering is a tradeoff.
As in, how do we know if the process is working? How do we know
if the angst from us non-IESG folk about delay is justified, or would
it have better spent trying impose discipline on the working group?

I guess I'm just a gprof kind 'o guy.

I really didn't want to take this off on this well trod tangent because
it was... pretty much a tangent. And I definitely didn't mean this turn
into some sort of grudgathon  :)
