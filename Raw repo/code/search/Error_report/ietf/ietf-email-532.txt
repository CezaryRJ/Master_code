NEW:
   When RTP and RTCP packets are multiplexed onto a single port, the
   RTCP packet type field occupies the same position in the packet as
   the combination of the RTP marker (M) bit and the RTP payload type
(PT).
   This field can be used to distinguish RTP and RTCP packets when two
   restrictions are observed: 1) the RTP payload type values used are
   distinct from the RTCP packet types used; and 2) for each RTP payload
   type (PT), PT+128 is distinct from the RTCP packet types used.
   The first constraint precludes a direct conflict between RTP payload
   type and RTCP packet type, the second constraint precludes a conflict
   between an RTP data packet with the marker bit set and an RTCP
packet.

Ok, and please bring the Section 4 text into line with this.

Ok, but IANA thinks the RTP static payload type registry is closed.

OTOH, if static payload types are a concern, should the current
72--76 "reserved for RTCP conflict avoidance" range in the RTP
payload type registry be expanded to 64--95 or 66--95 to prevent
conflicts with future RTCP packet type allocations?  That would
seem like a prudent thing to do.
