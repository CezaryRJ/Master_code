NAPTs were (misleadingly) marketed as security devices to consumers. 
But we were concerned about NATs in general, and at the time did not
make the generalization that all or most NATs were NAPTs.

IETF cannot do its job properly if it is a slave to "the industry" and
its current idea of market conditions.  The Internet is not a market
fad.  It's a lot more like a global public works project that will have
effects lasting for decades (at least) which will affect everyone on the
planet.  It is absolutely necessary to pay careful attention to the long
term effects of its design decisions, and this cannot be done by people
who feel pressure to put something on the market in six months or a year.

At the same time, IETF needs to understand that optimizing for
deployability first and scalability second often succeeds whereas the
reverse often fails.  We need to understand how to design protocols that
can be deployed quickly and yet be upgraded gracefully as the real
requirements for long-term widespread use of the protocols  become
apparent.
