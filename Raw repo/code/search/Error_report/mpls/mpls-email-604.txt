Hi,
   In fact the importance difference between the Differential Service with
Integrated Service is that the Differential Service is a Per-Hop basis QoS
mechanism where the Integrated Service is a end-to-end QoS mechanism. RSVP
is used as a resource reservation protocol for the integrated service. In
MPLS, there is some extension for the function of RSVP, but it is still
limited as a signalling protocol only. DiffSer don't need the RSVP at all.
  Hope this can be helpful.

Its job is to help prioritize things once congestion starts, and to penalize some flows to allow others to get less delay or loss. So, I guess DiffServ doesn't operate on the level of 1 LSP, but on a whole bunch of them?
