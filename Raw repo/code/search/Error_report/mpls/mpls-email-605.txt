Content : 

Diffserv allows traffic to be broken up into different classes of
service - which are queued and prioritized separately.

It does not, however, provide a mechanism to define (in each router)
what specific QoS should be provided for each class.

These can be ignored (making Diffserv merely a priority scheme), they
can be hand-configured, they can be configured through network
management, or they can be signalled.

RSVP is one means by which these can be signalled.

RSVP and Diffserv solve two different problems.  There are situations
where it makes sense to use one, or the other, or both.
