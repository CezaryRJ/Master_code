Agreed (and this matches the named used in the charter.)

We wanted to call out when we were using a defined term vs. the generic
equivalent (roughly equivalent of SHOULD vs should.)  Since we use a few
commonly used words (e.g. Message, Component ...) with a special meaning
we thought it was important to be clear what was intended.  For sections
that are prior to the terminology section we didn't wish to use defined
terms (since they weren't defined yet) and instead stick with generally
known wordings.  Another WG member already pointed out that we missed a
few terms that were used in the abstract (which is fixed in -01.)

If others agree that this hurts readibility we could make them lower
case as well and hope the reader understands this is a reserved term for
this spec.

Policy Attributes describe or reference policies that the Endpoint must
meet to be considered compliant ("must have <vendor> firewall running at
least version 1.2.3").  These are sent by the NEA Server (will add text
to mention this.)

Posture Attributes includes Posture information about a requested
Component (Firewall installed, version 1.5, Firewall running, ...)  The
Posture Validator compares this information to its policy to determine
compliance.  These are sent by the NEA Client.

I presume you mean Policy and Compliance Claim Attributes.  In some
sense you could argue this but we felt it was important to be more clear
about the different types of attributes as they have differing security,
privacy and operational properties.  We found these names very helpful
when writing the spec and hope that after a read of the draft they
aren't confusing.
