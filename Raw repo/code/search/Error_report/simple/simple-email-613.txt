I agree it could work. I recall even proposing this eons ago. With TURN 
and ICE tcp usage maturing it probably is much more viable these days 
than when msrp-relays started.

That said, there are going to be some differences. First and foremost is 
that with TURN, if you have two domains each of which deploy TURN 
servers, and you end up in a trapezoid configuration, you'll end up with 
a separate tcp connection set up between the two TURN servers for each 
MSRP session. I believe with MSRP the number of connections between 
servers would just be two.

Also, as Cullen is alluding to, TLS will work differently. With the 
latest TURN each client can have a TLS connection between itself and its 
own TURN server. However, inter-server TLS won't happen. Rather, you'd 
end up with TLS from one client to the other. Whether p2p TLS is a 
feature or a bug may depend on what you're trying to do, but with TURN 
relays it'll be p2p.

There are probably other differences too, but thats what comes to mind.

Thanks,
Jonathan R.
