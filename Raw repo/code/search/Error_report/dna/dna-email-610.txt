Hi James, 

There are responses to the top and bottom of your e-mail.

Don't be too despondent until you read the last lines...

You're right that the burden isn't too great, but one thing touted
as an advantage for Landmarks is their smaller size (with a Yes reply).
So it's a legitimate factor (though not necessarily a big one).

Also, the background cost of LinkID and CompleteRA are relevant,
since there are BNEP bridges available...   

If we compare unsolicited RA overheads we need to stress that with
DNA, the unsolicited rate can be decreased and still receive good 
performance.  We can present the rates for default RFC2461 RA,
with default MinRtrAdvInterval and MaxRtrAdvInterval (in bps), 
given the sample scenarios.

The minimum RA interval values can be presented for comparison, 
with a disclaimer that these values may not be needed.

Does this sound reasonable? (regardless of its necessity??)

I'll see if I can do this for the agreed criteria, in order to
make this available to the list.  My aim here is to provide
enough information for the WG to make its own decision.

In this case, I guess there may not be much difference, but
removing the uncertainty may help the decision process.

Your point is well taken.

I'll elicit help from others to facilitate this.
