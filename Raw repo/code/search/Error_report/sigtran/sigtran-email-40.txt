Jonathan:

I will make sure everyone at the bakeoff is aware of the upcoming
"checksum" change... Now one of the big questions yet is
what checksum should we use?

I kinda lean towards crc-32 myself (but of course I have no technical
basis for this and need to keep silent on which one to use anyway :->),
but do we have other candidates besides fletcher-32 and possibly
modified 
Adler-32 (i.e. 16 bit adds instead of 8)??

I will take the above 3 and do a bit of performance work this
week and post some numbers... thats about all I can do i.e.  tell
how much time the options I know of take... 

If you have some other candidates let me know and I can possibly get
some performance numbers on these as well...

As far as which is the best... I encourage all of you check-sum
experts out there to please join the thread :)

Oh, I know Jonathan Stone's paper will NOT be ready until sometime
in May.. so we may want to proceed slowly so that Craig Partridge and
he can have some cycles to add to this dicussion :)
