Lyndon,

It would appear using a 16 bit add rather than an 8 bit add within the
Adler-32 algorithm has three benefits.  It improves the small packet error
detection, the burst error detection, and performance.  The Alder algorithm
was designed for byte length detection, not a requirement for SCTP.  This
change introduces a blind spot however depending how it is implemented.  A
value at the modulo becomes lost if the higher order sum addition is done
after the modulo adjustment.  A 16 bit add with Adler would also have a
benefit for hardware implementation as it reduces the number of operations
by two.  To implement algorithms with limited resources, this potential
change is a move towards that goal.

If there was a means of identifying a CRC data payload where CRC is placed
at the end of the data chunk, then including CRC as an additional check
before acknowledging becomes possible for those fixated on burst error
detection.   For CRC to have similar instruction overhead requires a 128K
lookup table which seems to exclude it from being a baseline check.  If
there was also an API flag to indicate if CRC was checked would also allow
this option to be done either by the transport or the application or
ignored.
