I don't agree with your last sentence. Where exactly does 2119 say
"that deserves explanation"? Look also at Section 6 of 2119. It says:

The above bolsters the argument that SHOULD is often more appropriate
than MUST.

In my experience, we often use the word SHOULD because we think that
something is the obvious thing to do, but to make it a MUST simply
goes to far. MUST is absolute and allows for no wiggle room, and can
significantly reduce flexibility of future extensions/specs.

If the IESG is now requring all uses of SHOULD to give examples of
when the SHOULD might not apply, I think that goes a bit far. In some
cases, SHOULD is chosen because we can imagine a future spec taking
advantage of something that would not be consistent with the
SHOULD. That is MUCH harder to do when a previous spec says MUST. When
a party a MUST do something, peers sometimes take that to mean that if
the someone doesn't do the MUST, that is a protocol violation and then
do less-than-ideal things (like silently discard a message, return an
error message, etc.)

Also, anyone familiar with WG discussions knows that there is often
support for SHOULD, but not for MUST.
