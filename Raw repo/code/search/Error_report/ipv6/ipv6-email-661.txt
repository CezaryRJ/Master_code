Well, sometimes.  It depends what you're doing.

Either way:  You need to know the customer's address.  A DHCPv6 server
off in the weeds does not necessarily know what link local address the
client is using (because it might change without notification).  It
may know what global addresses the client is using (because it
allocated them), but won't if router solicition is in use.  A
router solicitation system certainly doesn't have any knowledge of
which customer is which nor what addresses global or not which they're
using.

This is but one facet of a network's operation: try not to focus on
it too much.  There are potentially a multitude of reasons to know
which of your customers are online, and how to reach them.  Testing
connectivity alone (such as during a support call).

I'm not sure why you make this declaration (twice now), when no one
has suggested the counterpositive.  Maybe I misunderstood Iljitsch.

Which I think gets us back to what Iljitsch said in the first place,
except that realistically ISPs are going to find it difficult and/or
costly to trust routing information from eg broadband customers, so
really what you're looking at is some way to provide a register of
your customers' current addresses.
