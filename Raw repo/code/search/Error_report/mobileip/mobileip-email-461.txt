Hi,

In my opinion, additional messages makes the protocol partly clearer,
but partly more complex.

Here are my questions (please point me to the appropriate messages, if
these questions have already been discussed :)

- Is it possible/needed that a FA does not know the GFA or GFAs above
it?
I think FAs and GFAs should have trust relationships = knowledge of
each other.

- Why do we need to add intelligence to the mobile node?
Having a totally transparent hierarchy is possible. The MN would speak
standard RFC2002 MIP and would still get the best efficiency in
registrations through the regionalized handoffs. By defining new
messages we do add intelligence to MN. It must know what kind of
registrations to send.

And my totally subjective opinion:
  ;-)
Despite the lively discussion about regionalized handoffs etc., I
still have not seen many transparent, fast and *implemented*
approaches. If the ideas in the drafts have been implemented, please
provide the community some links to the material. Dynamics  - HUT
Mobile IP has been rocking for 1.5 years now. Dynamics is transparent
to the Mobile Node and still provides fast handoffs.

Should we write a competing draft? ;-) We didn't do it in the first
place because we felt it would just slow down the fast handoff design
process. Unfortunately the process has been unbelievably slow. I am
really looking forward to a solution in this issue.

Regards,
	Tom

Hello Charlie,

Here comes my lengthy comments about reg-tunnel-03. Sorry for a long
email, but there were lots of things to comment.
I hope the ASCII graphics is not distorted.
I found quite many issues.
Some of them might be possible to solve with more explanations (maybe
I just did not get the ideas). Some of the issues should be solved in
other ways. More ideas below. Read on.

COMMENTS TO draft-ietf-mobileip-reg-tunnel-03.txt

Tom Weckstrm

Legend:
+ = A positive note
- = A negative note, criticism
? = A question
! = Exclamation, either a critical issue or an important suggestion
idea
--> = conclusion mark

Ch 1.
+ Decision power at MN: regional or home registration possible
? Is it always good to let the MN deicde what kind of registration to
use?
? What are the benefits in giving the MN the right to decide?

- Different registration types makes the protocol more complex
  - Changes to std RFC2002 MN
  - Changes to FAs

Ch 3.1
? Is there a possibility to make a HA hierarchy as well?
  If not, why then?
--> Possibly another draft. Could be derived from J.K.Malinen's
thesis.

3.1.1.
? Why only assume two levels of FAs in the visited domain?

? Is the protocol fully flexible in its current form to support
N-level hierarchies? It should be. More comments after Appendix B.

"We assume that there exist established
   security associations between a GFA and the regional foreign
   agents beneath it."
---> This implies the RFAs HAVE to know their GFA.
---> Satwant Kaur's scenario with RFA not knowing the GFA is
impossible.
---> No need for different message types for regional and home
registration.
---> More transparency and simpleness achieved.

3.3.

" If the `I' bit is set, there MUST be at least one care-of address in
the Agent Advertisement message."
"If the `I' bit is set, and there is only one care-of address, it is
   the address of the GFA."
---> If so, there cannot be a situation where GFA is not known at the
     moment of registration. (Provided the address is real, not zero.)

---> The text could be clarified to mention about the relationships of
     the FAs in the hierarchy. Do they all know each other? Do they
     only know who's above and who's below them?.


3.4.1.

+ Setting GFA IP to zero improves flexibility.

"If the `I' bit is set, but the GFA
   address is zero (0), the mobile node MUST check to make sure that
it
   receives a GFA IP address extension as part of any home
registration,
   or else send its home registration using the care-of address of
some
   previously known GFA in the same visited domain."

? This makes the possible topologies more cumbersome.
---> Eg. GFA1, ..., GFA4 are all connected to RFA1 and RFA2 and RFA3
and RFA4.
? Why is this needed? For load balancing type of activities?

? Does the possibility to set GFA address to zero in the request open
new holes in the security?  E.g. Mallory acts as an additional GFA in
the hierarchy and captures MN's reg.reg. coming from RFA1. This gives
a possibility to intrude as a GFA into MIP signaling. However,
additional bonuses are few. And eventually Mallory could set up his
own ISP.

3.4.2.

" If the care-of address field is set to zero, the foreign agent
   assigns a GFA to the mobile node, by some means not described in
   this specification, and adds a GFA IP Address extension to the
   Registration Request message."

? RFA selects the GFA? RFA has no knowledge of GFA conditions (load,
etc.). How could an RFA make the decision? This could be solved with
the topology or by other means, but involves more protocol
intelligence anyway and whence adds to complexity.


"and it SHOULD be protected by an FA-FA Authentication extension."
? Where is FA-FA auth ext described? In another draft, I suppose.


3.5.1.

" it is necessary to distinguish regional registrations from home
   registration.  Thus, we introduce new message types for the
   Regional Registration messages."

? Could we make the distinction by defining that every registration
with a valid MN-FA auth ext is a regional registration? Furthermore,
if there is no MN-FA auth ext or if that extension is invalid, the FAs
forward the message upwards in the hierarchy.
Example: Consider an N-level hierarchy. See image below:

                                 ------
                                 | HA |
                                 ------
                                   |
                               (Internet)
                                   |
                                -------
                                | GFA |
                                -------
                              /         \
                      -------             -------
                      | FA1 |             | FA2 |
                      -------             -------
                       /   \               /   \
                 -------   -------   -------   -------
                 | FA3 |   | FA4 |   | FA5 |   | FA6 |
                 -------   -------   -------   -------
                                  \
                                   \
                                 ------
                                 | MN |
                                 ------

                  Figure 1: Mobility Agent Hierarchy


! Now, if MN is registered to FA4 and changes to FA6, then it sends
the
registration request to FA6 and FA6 does not know the MN-FA auth ext
in the registration neither has it heard of MN before (no mobility
bindings existing for MN). Then FA6 jsut forwards the request upwards
to FA2. FA2 also does not have a clue about MN, so it too forwards the
request upwards. Finally, GFA knows the MN from its bindings and also
can validate the MN-FA auth ext. Eventually, this registration became
regional. Now, if there were no MN-FA auth ext, or if it was invalid,
also the GFA would have forwarded the message - now to the HA.  Maybe
an invalid auth extensions should result in request denial if the MN
is known to the FA (i.e. there is a binding for the MN in the
FA). After all the MN is known, and the authentication does not match.

! Anyway, there seems to be no need for separate regional and home
registration messages. The MN still has the choice to either include
the FA-MN auth ext or leave it away.

! NOTE, that this is directly applicable to N-level hierarchies!


3.5.2.

" The only difference is that there is the GFA IP address instead of
   the address of the home agent."

? Does this mean that the Home Agent field in the RFC2002 compliant
registration request field has the IP addr of GFA? Section
6.1. verified this assumption. This could be more clearly stated
already in section 3.5.2.



4.2.

"By comparing the domain part of the foreign agent NAI with the domain
   part of its own NAI, the mobile node can determine whether it is in
   its home domain or in a visited domain, and whether it has changed
   domain since it last registered."

+ Exactly! Good. :)


6.1.


"
  GFA IP Address
      The IP address of the Gateway Foreign Agent.  (Replaces
       Home Agent field in Registration Request message
       in [9].)

      Care-of Address
                 Care-of address of local foreign agent; MAY be set to
                 zero.
"

? Why should the HA field be replaced? There is the COA field to
be used for the GFA IP addr. The FAs in the hierarchy can use
extensions or directly the source IP of the outer header to get the
address of the "lower" agent in the hierarchy as the registration
traverses upwards.

? Why is the COA field filled with the local COA?  The lowest FA
always knows behind which interface the MN is.  The FA aboe the lowest
FA knows the interface from which the first reg.request came and also
the IP of the lowest FA. This continues from the bottom of the FA tree
to the top, i.e., the GFA. ALL that is needed in MIP sense is the GFA
IP in the COA field and this is for the HA. The hierarchy of FAs
handles the tunneling in the hierarhcy by other means.




A.

" - a mobile node must be able to distinguish between regional
     registrations and home registrations, because when it uses
     regional registration, the nounces are not synchronized with its
     home agent;"

! Dynamics works with nonces also, and it supports regional
registrations. I have to find out how the nonce synchronization is
done in Dynamics. Perhaps the lack of FA-MN auth ext (again) is enough
for the MN to control between home and regional registrations.


B.2.
"
 This process is repeated in each RFA in the hierarchy, until an RFA
   recognizes the mobile node as already registered.  This RFA may be
   the GFA, or any RFA beneath it in the hierarchy.  If the mobile
node
   is already registered with this RFA, the RFA generates a Regional
   Registration Reply and sends it to the next lower-level RFA in the
   hierarchy.  The lifetime field in the Regional Registration Reply
is
   set to the remaining lifetime that was earlier agreed upon between
   the mobile node and the GFA. If the lifetime of the GFA
registration
   has expired, the Regional Registration Request is relayed all the
way
   to the GFA.

   If the hierarchy between the advertising foreign agent and the GFA
is
   announced in the Agent Advertisement, the mobile node may generate
   a Regional Registration Request not destined to the GFA, but to the
   closest RFA with which it can register.
"

? So, if the FA hierarchy is not revealed in the advertisements, then
the regional registrations always go to the GFA?

! There are drawbacks with this approach:

  - The hierarchy is not transparent anymore
    --> A security issue
    --> Needs more functionality in MN

  - The advertisements become some bytes larger because of the
    hierarchy information in them.

  - IF the hierarchy is not revealed, then the GFA is loaded because
    of ALL the regional registrations coming to it.

--> SUGGESTION:

!    Make the MN add a "previous FA NAI" extension to its
registrations
    intended for regional handling. See more info from Jouni Malinen's
    thesis (p. 29-30) available on Dynamics HUT MIP web site. This
    removes the rece condition inherent in for example Dynamics v. 0.5
    which used specific tear down messages. This also keeps the
    hierarhcy completely transparent and does NOT require any complex
    intelligence from the MN, e.g. to claculate the closest "common"
    RFA that could be the target for a regional registration. Adding
    the previous FA NAI extension is very straightforward and does not
    require any additional intelligence from the MN.


B.2.1.

"   recognizes the mobile node as already registered, may generate a
   Regional Registration Reply, not all Regional Registration Requests
   will reach the GFA. Therefore, if old locations are not
deregistered,
   it is possible that tunnels are not correctly redirected when a
   mobile node moves back to a previous foreign agent."

! I think Jouni Malinen solved this issue in his thesis, too. The
solution is tied to the "previous FA NAI extension". Jouni's thesis,
pages 29-30 at least, clarify this solution.
 


" In case (3), the mobile node sends a Regional Registration Request
to
   its new foreign agent.  If the mobile node does not request smooth
   handoff, the previous foreign agent is not notified.  The Regional
   Registration Request is relayed upwards in the hierarchy until it
   reaches a foreign agent that recognizes the mobile node as already
   registered.  This foreign agent generates a Regional Registration
   Reply and sends it downwards in the hierarchy toward the new
location
   of the mobile node, updating its own visitor list.  At the same
time,
   it also sends a Binding Update with a zero lifetime to the previous
   care-of address it had registered for the mobile node.  The Binding
   Update is authenticated by the FA-FA Authentication extension. 
Each
   foreign agent receiving the Binding Update removes the mobile node
   from its visitor lists.  The Binding Update is relayed down to the
   care-of address of the mobile node known to that foreign agent, and
   each foreign agent in the hierarchy receiving this notification
   removes the mobile node from its visitor list.
"

! This results in the race condition I mentioned before. Dynamics v
0.5
had similar kind of message with zero binding lifetime. We called this
a "tear down" message, because it tore down the old bindings and
tunnels. There is a race condition in this, when for example tear down
messages are lost. The state of the FA hierarchy is not up to date a
fter one missed tear down message. Use "previous FA NAI" extension
instead. This, too, has a possible problem, also mentioned in Jouni's
thesis, if the reg.reply is lost and MN moves forward to another FA
that may think it can actually answer the request. This can be soved
as in Jouni's thesis or by only using the NAI of that FA from which we
previously have received a positive reg.reply....


" If the mobile node uses a co-located care-of address for its
regional registration, there is no need to deregister its previous
location when it moves, since regional registrations with a co-located
care-of address are performed directly with the GFA."

! I would say this is a limitation of your architecture. The GFA MUST
NOT be automatically burdened by this kind of registrations. If this
is not fixed, then we lose a part of the whole idea of using
hierarchies - to distribute and localize the registration handling as
much as possible.

Hi,

I am slowly starting to "buy" the idea of separate message types for
regional and home registrations... More comments below.

I am waiting your reply about the other issues I mentioned. Here is a
brief checklist of issues not handled in this email (or in your
reply).

        - Revealing the hierarchy in advertisements
                        vs
        - Using previous FA NAI extensions


        * Limiting the solution to 2 levels
                        vs
        * Making generic solution that is ready for N-levels.


        o Forcing registrations from co-located COA to GFA
                        vs
        o Always using the optimal RFA for handling the registrations


        x Possibility to use HA hirarchies (possibly another draft).

Yes, MN needs to be able to control what kind of registration it
requests.

Your problem in the example above comes from a case where you would
use GFA's IP in the HA field and only one type of registration
message. That is the wrong way, we both know that.

We end up to two alternatives already presented, but I write them here
to make WG "voting" easier:

A)      Use separate message types for regional and home registrations.
        Use FA IP in the "HA field" of the regional registration.
        Actually, if this is a separate message type, then the RFC's
        sepcification is not misused, because we are talking about an
        entiryl new message here. :)

B)      Use only one registration request message type.
        Add FA-MN auth.ext. to registration, if regional registration
        is requested. Always use HA IP in its field.
        The registration can still be forwarded up to HA, if FAs decide so.
        MN will know the "destiny" of the registration only when regreply
        arrives. (with Home auth ext. or with foreign auth ext.)

Couple of additional comments:

- Changes to RFC2002 MN would still be needed - True. We need an MN
taht can leave the foreign euth ext away on purpose to force
registration to HA (when we are using approach B above).

- It would be good that a RFC2002 MN would be using regional
registrations by default when adding the MN-FA auth.ext. by default.
As an Internet user I would be concerned, if a proposed standard would
not act optimally, but rather consumed bandwidth from the Internet
with its non-optimal registration sequences.

- "Failure to authenticate" would for me be: there was a foreign auth
ext. but we could not verify its authenticity.
--> Direct regreply with correct reason code to MN.

- Lack of the auth ext. would not mean "failure", but the FA would
forward the request onwards.

We come back to options A and B.
As I said, using GFA IP in the new message in option A is OK, since it
is not anymore a RFC2002 registration request but a new type of
request.

I discussed with Jouni. Dynamics can uses nonces for home
registrations, i.e., registration requests without MN-FA auth ext. but
only timestamps are used in registrations with FA-MN auth. ext. This
eliminates the possibility of uncontrolled nonce asynchronization.

You are also welcome to visit Finland to see it work.
Unfortunately we do not have any conference papers in pipeline or
budget to travel to WG meetings.
