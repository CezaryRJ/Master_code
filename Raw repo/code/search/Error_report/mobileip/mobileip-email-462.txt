Hi,
I am Gobinath from INDIA.I have LG RD2030 CDMA mobile phone. I changed it's ESN successfully with
help of INTER CDMA TOOL 1.2.
Now i am trying to program it for other number for other network, but
to no avail.

in NAM 1 it's showing two number Min1 & Min2 which are not the phone
number it is carrying. (Min 1 is 8 numbers & min2 is 3 numbers). I
changed Min 1 to new phone number (10 digit new number) and min2 to
000.
But it's not working, if i try to call it calls to previous network
where operator says, your mobile phone is not authorised.

Is it nessary to change SID and P CH A & S CH A?
(country code are same.)
What could be wrong?? anyone help me plz.

my mail id
gobi_65@yahoo.com


Regards,
Gobinath.
