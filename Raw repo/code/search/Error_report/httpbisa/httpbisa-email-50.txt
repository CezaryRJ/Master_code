there that badly choked on charset parameters.

So it wasn't that the default was an attempt to save some bytes
for Latin-1, but that it was in some way necessary to be backwards-
compatible with very early versions not documented as RFCs.

Such backwards compatibility is no longer necessary, fortunately.
The situation currently on the Web is different. The actual
'default' used by browsers isn't simply iso-8859-1, it's whatever
the user has set as his/her preferred encoding, or whatever the
setting of the specific language version is. This means that in
essence, there is NO default. The HTTP spec clearly should be
fixed to say so.

At least 2070 and 2277 were in the works for a really long time.
That may also apply to 2068.

That was put in because the HTML WG at that time already more
or less understood (after a lot of discussions) that the direction
to go was Unicode/ISO 10646. A lot of the work on HTML 2.0 and
HTML i18n (RFC 2070) and some other pieces was going on somewhat
in parallel.

It wasn't just Harald and me. It was a lot more people, in particular
all the coauthors of RFC 2070 and 2277.
