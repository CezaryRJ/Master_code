Just noticed that we did not include descriptions for the
columns in the spreadsheet.  Here they are:

1st column - Section number of an internet-draft version
of this spreadsheet, which we will generate if needed.

2nd column - Category; we divided up the different features
into some categories that made sense to us.  The first set
is common to all iSCSI implementations; the second and third
are for those features that apply just to targets or initiators.

3rd column - Feature; short description of each feature.

4th column - Reference; a reference to the section number of the
iSCSI document that best describes the feature and its status.

5th column - Status.

   M = Mandatory
   O = Optional
   R = Recommended (we have none of these now)
   X = Prohibited (we have none of these, either)

   If numbers appear after the status, e.g. M:4.5, it means that
   the feature is mandatory if the feature numbered 4.5 is
   implemented.  I just noticed that some of our numbers had changed,
   so a few of these might still be typos.

6th column - Value.  This is used if the feature is more than just
a check box; for instance, if an implementation supports "Data Digest -
Other",
it is used to indicate some reference to what "other" means.

Hope this helps,

Mark
