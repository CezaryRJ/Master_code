Yes, looking at the examples we had in the scenarios draft should be a
good start for determining which kind of information is needed in such a
document. I'll see if I can submit a revamped version of the scenarios 
draft for the next meeting.

In general, I think the general rule should be disclose what you have.
I.e. a UA should essentially encode what it has in the SDP announcement
and a few extra fields (e.g. request URI, session ID). I really would
not want a situation where policy server and UA start to negotiate what
should be disclosed and what not.

Regarding the more general comment having too few examples, I've added a
number of examples in various place of the draft. Hope this helps to
address this concern.

Done.

Done.

Added two specific examples.

I've added an example for that.

It should be a MUST. I've also added some text clarifying this.

Done.

Done.

Yes, I agree. Since the XML format still needs some work to enable its 
use in SUBSCRIBE bodies, I probably won't be able to add an example for 
this revision but will put this on my to do list.

Thanks!
