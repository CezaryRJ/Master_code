I have been a little delayed finding the time up to now to get into the
public SIPPING list discussions on this. But I have already been
involved earlier in some discussions on this within 3GPP and also
privately with some of the SIPPING participants.

=20

Firstly I am supportive of the basic requirement to provide a
straightforward means to easily identify that SIP requests are related
to a particular communication service.=20

=20

Of course it is possible to take a view that there is only a single
communication service enabled by SIP however in reality I think both the
average user and service providers have the need to group and package
features and capabilities together as "communication services"

=20

My definition of a "communication service" is a somewhat arbitrary
bundle or package of capabilities that make some sense when grouped
together from either a user experience or a service provider business
perspective. Some service groupings are historical (such as replicating
the telephony supplementary services of GSM or a 5ESS) others are based
on a grouping of those capabilities available in popular products (such
as MSN messenger and Netmeeting). Others may be "public services" such
as Emergency Services.

=20

If you try to provide users with several hundred capabilities without
some simple groupings that they can remember, understand and relate to
you end up with more options than they will buy or can practically use.
Therefore it is convenient and useful for users to have capabilities and
features grouped or packaged together as "communication services".
Remember that the average consumer cannot program their VCR!

=20

>From a service provider perspective packaging capabilities and fe and we will end up with something like +g.im.messaging =
tags included
everywhere with that. If we don&#8217;t come up with an appropriate =

together as "communication services" allows them to sell different
communication service options to their customers. I know some take a
view that "service based charging" is "evil" but I think it is
unrealistic to expect that service providers will always provide all
services together for a flat fee especially when these services require
investment in additional infrastructure such as Presence Servers,
Conference Servers, Voice Mail Server, Media Servers, etc. In fact it
probably isn't in my interests as a user to have service providers
provide everything all together for a flat fee because then I will end
up paying for all those things that I don't want or have any use for. It
is useful to give users some choice in what services they sign up to but
in a way that reduces the total list of options to something that is
understandable to most people.

=20

Although Telephony and Push To talk share a similar characteristic in
that they both exchange audio communication they can be considered, sold
and deployed as different "communication services". The user experience
and understanding of these services is different even is they both
involve audio communication. Likewise you could deploy instant messaging
and Push to talk as part of the same "communication service" even though
they don't exchange the same media as from a user experience perspective
they can be perceived as messaging style communication.

=20

A call for emergency assistance although similar in many respects to a
telephone call is not the same and has different characteristics such as
the need to be routed to a particular PSAP based on the callee's
location, the automatic providing of location information to the
emergency responder, the disabling of the interactions with some other
telephony features, prioritized signaling and resource reservation and
zero based charging. Thus an Emergency service is different to a
Standard Telephony service.

=20

In SIPPING and ECRIT we have been discussing supporting Emergency
Services and there are proposals to define a services URN to identify
the Emergency Service. The use of this service URN could also be
extended to also cover other Communication services defined by standards
organizations (e.g 3GPP, OMA, TISPAN...), Service providers (MSN, Skype
etc) and local government, academic institutions and private
corporations. Possibly this is part of the Communication Service
Identifier solution.

=20

Currently the problem of identifying a communication service has been
resolved by bodies such as OMA simply defining feature-tags for Services
and including them in the Accept-Contact header. For instance OMA PoC
has defined a +g.poc.talkburst tag and terminals and servers include
this tag in the Accept-Contact of all initial requests.

=20

The semantics of Accept-Contact as I understand them are really only
related to the matching of a feature set predicate to a capability set.
These predicates can be quite complicated and simply including a feature
tag as a service identifier in an Accept-Contact header seems to be both
overload and extend the scope of what was intended in RFC 3840/3841 and
cause potential interactions that could significantly restrict the use
of complex predicates.=20

=20

Now +g.poc.talkburst can be considered as an expression of a preference
to reach a device that is OMA PoC talkburst control capable which is
necessary for OMA PoC and hence compatible with the semantics of
Accept-Contact. However in PoC this tag is also included in Subscribes
to the conference state event package and other messages such a Publish
that are sent to PoC Servers that are not directly related to or really
requiring talkburst control or even destined to reach the PoC terminals.
In this case the Accept-Contact header is being overloaded to just
transport a tag that can be used by Filter Criteria as a trigger to
route to the PoC server and to associate this request as being part of
the PoC Communication Service for charging and policy purposes.

Many of the requirements that are listed for the IMS Communication
Service Identifier seem not to be compatible with the current defined
semantics of feature tags in Accept-Contact. In fact only requirement 11
seems to fully match the semantics of a feature tag in Accept-Contact.
Requirement 4 on invoking services through some intermediate node
between the endpoints seems to be clearly out of the scope of the
current semantics of Accept-Contact as is requirement 10 on authorizing
the request based on the Communication Service Identifier.

=20

There is also the requirement for invoking applications at endpoints
based on the IMS Service Identifier and this needs to be considered and
the solution documented within IETF so that it will be generally
applicable.

=20

I also share Jonathan's and other concern that this is not used to
create a situation where applications cannot interoperate between
different domains. Requirement 12 addresses this issue however having
SIPPING work on the problem should be a way to help ensure this doesn't
happen.

Subject: [Sipping] Requirements for the identification of IMS
communicationservices.

=20

Hello All,=20

I am of the understanding that there have been some questions regarding
the requirements for the identification of IMS services.  I would like
to provide an understanding of the 3GPP discussions on this topic.  As I
see it, the need to identify the IMS communication services stems from
that we have/are devloping different services on IMS as a SIP
infrastructure, such as push-to-talk over cellular (PoC) or messaging.
As there are different services and as it is not safe to rely on the
expressed media as the media may be used in different services then
there is the need to identify the service that is requisted.  This could
be seen as a means to identify the context upon which to interpret the
SIP signalling.  This is required to e.g. Identify the application
server that supports this communication service and to identify the
client to invoke in the terminating network.  While writting this, I
seem to recall a parrallel discussion in relation to presence, and that
was along the lines that was that it was required to identify the
service that was used to communicate in the presence, as otherwise two
if the same presence information appeared for two incompatabile services
(e.g. two incomptable versions of push to talk) which fulfulled the same
end-user expectation appeared the same in presence, then the end-user
would get confused as to why s/he could communicate with some users but
not with others.

Please note that this is not intended to identify service that are
routed to, such as train time tables etc.  For these services, the
communication services is a means to route to and reach the ultimtate
end-user service.  This discussion is about how to identify the
communication service.

This has been discussed at an architectural level within 3GPP and a
Technical Report has been produced.  The Technical report can be found

<Specification Text>=20
4.13.2  Identification of IMS communication Services=20
A communication service identifier provides a framework for the
identification of IMS communication services utilising the IMS enablers.
An IMS communication service is provided via the use of the IMS
enablers. At terminals, the use of a communication service identifier is
similar to the use of the port concept in TCP/IP, in that it allows
applications in a terminal and the network that use SIP for
communication purposes to be identified. In the terminal this means
dispatching a SIP message to the correct application, and in the network
it means selection of the correct application server over ISC. Examples
of IMS based applications and communication services are OMA messaging
and OMA PoC.

The communication service is an aggregation of one or several media
components and the service logic managing the aggregation, represented
in the protocols used. Its behaviour and characteristics may be
standardized as done for the two examples above, or proprietary and
specific for e.g. an operator or an enterprise.

A service description specifies this behaviour and states e.g. the
allowed media combinations and state transitions as a consequence of
signalling and use of IMS enablers in the network and terminals.

The need of applying a service identifier is to be taken within the
specification of each individual service.=20
The communication service identifier identifies IMS communication
services and shall be included in the relevant SIP methods.

The IMS communication service identifier shall fulfil the following
requirements:=20
1. It shall be possible for the UE and an Application Server (AS) to set
the=20
   IMS communication service identifier in a SIP request, e.g. in the=20
   REGISTER and INVITE request.=20
2. Based on operator policy the S-CSCF or an AS shall be able to
validate an=20
   IMS communication service identifier in a SIP request. This includes
e.g.=20
   to check the syntactical correctness of a service identifier, and
policing=20
   the usage of a communication service identifier.=20
3. It shall be possible, e.g. for the UE, S-CSCF and AS, to identify an=20
   IMS service uniquely by the IMS communication service identifier.=20
4. It shall be possible for the S-CSCF to invoke appropriate service=20
   logic based on the IMS communication service identifier contained=20
   in a SIP request, e.g. route a SIP request containing a service
identifier=20
   based on initial filter criteria to the correct AS.=20
5. It shall be possible for the UE to invoke appropriate application=20
   based on the IMS communication service identifier contained in a=20
   received SIP request.=20
6. It shall be possible for the UE to indicate its service capabilities=20

    assume a particular IMS communication service.=20
14. The usage of communication service identifiers shall not restrict
the inherent=20
    capabilities of SIP.=20
15. The usage of communication service identifiers shall not require
additional user=20
    interaction, i .e. the communication service identifier is assumed=20
    to be "added" by the UE that initiates the communication.=20

The network and the terminal shall be able to continue operation as
defined in 3GPP Release 5 and 3GPP Release 6.=20

The communication service identifier shall be available at least in the
following interfaces:=20
-       ISC; Gm; Mi, Mj, Mk, Mw; Mg; Mr;=20
-       Cx; Dx (e.g as part of the iFC);=20
-       Rx;=20
-       Rf, Ro.=20

NOTE:   The communication service identifier does not replace the=20
public service identity (PSI). The communication service identifier
would be used to indicate the communication service used to access the
service addressed via a PSI, and is required to identify the
communication service even when SIP requests are sent towards another
entity without using a PSI.

4.13.2  Identification of IMS applications=20

An IMS application is an application that uses an IMS communication
service(s) in order to provide a specific service to the end-user.  The
IMS application uses specific IMS Communication Service(s) and provides
the end user service through the reuse of the SIP communication part of
service. The IMS application does not extend the definition of the IMS
communication service.  The IMS application reference identifies the
application utilising the IMS communication service.

<< removed figure >>=20

Figure 4.13-1:  IMS applications on top of an IMS communication service
The IMS application reference is used to identify the IMS applications
other than the default for the IMS communication service.  The IMS
application reference has significance at the UE and the SIP AS behaving
as SIP endpoints.  The means to transport the IMS application reference
is defined within the IMS communication services.  When used, it shall
be possible to transport the IMS application reference on at least on
the following interfaces:

*       ISC; Gm; Mi, Mj, Mk, Mw; Mg; Mr; Ro, Rx, Rf=20

would like to provide an understanding of the 3GPP discussions on this

stems from that we have/are devloping different services on IMS as a SIP

messaging.&nbsp; As
there are different services and as it is not safe to rely on the =

media as the media may be used in different services then there is the =
need to
identify the service that is requisted.&nbsp; This could be seen as a =
means to
identify the context upon which to interpret the SIP signalling.&nbsp; =
This is
required to e.g. Identify the application server that supports this
communication service and to identify the client to invoke in the =
terminating
network.&nbsp; While writting this, I seem to recall a parrallel =
discussion in
relation to presence, and that was along the lines that was that it was
required to identify the service that was used to communicate in the =
presence,
as otherwise two if the same presence information appeared for two
incompatabile services (e.g. two incomptable versions of push to talk) =
which
fulfulled the same end-user expectation appeared the same in presence, =

that use SIP for communication purposes to be identified. In the =

means dispatching a SIP message to the correct application, and in the =

it means selection of the correct application server over ISC. Examples =
