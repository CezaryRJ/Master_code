Hi,

One approach would of course be to not allow reliable provisional
responses for re-INVITEs in the first place.

But, then we MAY have a problem with preconditions - but not
necessarily.

The SDP answerer could simply choose not to send 200 OK until he has
reserved the needed resources. Ie he does not send any provisional
responses.

The SDP offerer would then send a second re-INVITE/UPDATE when he has
reserved the needed resources (unfortunatly he can't use the ACK to
indicate it).

Regards,

Christer
