Content : 

an egress LSR (LER), this LSR needs to match between the incoming packet =
and one of his opened LDP sessions. There are several options to solve =
this issue: one would be to change RFC 4379 and to add to the LDP ipv4 =
FEC described in the RFC a ping originator address (this address should =
be the originator=92s transport address).  Another option can be to =
conclude the LDP session from the source ip address of the echo request =
packet. The last option in my opinion shouldn=92t be the preferred one =
since it requires matching between the incoming packet and the =
address-list TLV used in the LDP protocol. However even this last option =
should have been discussed in the RFC.=20

=20

Please enlighten me with your thoughts.

Did I miss something in the RFC.=20
