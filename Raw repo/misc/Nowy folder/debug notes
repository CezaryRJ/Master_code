The problem with wissing headers is that the email itterator sees the header as its own message
solve by keenping the last message on hand


mails with error
<E1FUUIr-0004gY-KU@stiedprstage1.ietf.org>

messages arrive out of order
some arrive several time
some do both

arrive with no header, no way to track by msg id

no way oknow what part it belongs to

comparing, use external tools or make own ?
